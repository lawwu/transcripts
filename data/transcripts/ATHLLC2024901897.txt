[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.960]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.840]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.520]   Now, so many business leaders say that you should just focus on one thing and
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.720]   not spread yourself too thin on so many different projects, and that the way to
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.200]   success is to laser focus on one goal, one product, one business idea, and
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.240]   tune everything else out.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.440]   But our guest today, Jen Glantz, throws all that advice out the window because
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.240]   she's an entrepreneur with multiple businesses, multiple streams of income,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.720]   and she thrives at doing it.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.600]   She started her first business, Bridesmaid for Hire, after an ad she
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.240]   placed in Craigslist went viral.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.600]   But she's also written three books, over 1,500 articles for publications from
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.040]   Forbes, to the Today Show, to the Washington Post.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760]   She hosts a podcast, You're Not Getting Any Younger, which I had the pleasure of
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.400]   being a guest on a few weeks ago.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.200]   And if that's not enough, she has 3 newsletters, sells digital courses, does
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.680]   professional coaching and speaking.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.840]   And oh, she has her own game called The Newlywed Card Game.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.400]   I have no idea how she does it all.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.920]   So let's jump in and find out.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.840]   Jen, thank you for being here.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.640]   Wow, Chris.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.440]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.960]   I honestly forget all that I do until you just read that intro.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.760]   And then I was like, "Wow, that is a lot.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.280]   That is a lot."
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.360]   But I'm really proud of it all.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.720]   So my first question is just, did you always think you would be someone that
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   had all of these projects and businesses going on?
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.040]   In all honesty, I was that person at my full-time job that couldn't just do my
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.440]   job.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.280]   I was working at a startup as a copywriter and I couldn't just write.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.520]   I had to know how the sales team was doing.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   I wanted to know what a project manager was.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.160]   Like I was always so curious about other things.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.840]   I was also the person at my full-time job that did the whole job within like a
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.600]   couple of hours and had the rest of the day to do nothing.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.080]   And that's when I started writing a blog and started doing all my own work while
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.960]   I was getting paid at my full-time job.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   So I always knew that I was never a person who wanted to do just one thing,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.840]   but I never knew what I was going to ultimately do.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.720]   I majored in poetry in college.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.120]   So I feel like I set myself up for a life of question marks.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.160]   And when I graduated, I just knew I didn't want to live a standard life.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.520]   I knew I didn't want to be someone else's employee.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.200]   I knew I wanted so much more from myself, but I didn't necessarily know where that
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.840]   would take me.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.880]   The first side hustle was Bridesmaid for Hire, right?
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.080]   Well, actually I would say my first side hustle was a blog.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.600]   I started in 2011 called the things I learned from. And I wrote that blog.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.080]   I had no readers that grew and grew and grew.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.240]   And eventually that led to me getting a book deal and that led to me becoming a
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.720]   freelance writer. So while I didn't necessarily make money off of the blog,
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.760]   when I first started it,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.440]   it led to all of these different opportunities that propelled my journey.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.760]   And I'd started the blog because I was working a really bad job and nobody
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.200]   would publish my writing and I wanted to be a writer.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.440]   So I started this blog on WordPress and that was a game changer that set me up
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.760]   for so much more to come.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.560]   So I think one takeaway there is it doesn't have to be a business to
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.600]   necessarily become a business. So if you're listening and you're thinking, Oh,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.560]   like I have this thing, I don't know how to make money from it.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.240]   Your example here is you did this thing that made no money.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.440]   And now you have, I don't know, seven, eight,
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.240]   like different businesses and streams of income that kind of all came from that.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   How did you know when to spend more time on the blog or any other project versus
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.880]   you had a day job?
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.000]   When I was working full time, I realized, okay,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.920]   I don't necessarily need the income from other projects.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.000]   So let me throw some things out there and see what sticks, see what's going well.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.760]   I've always been a person who likes to work on multiple things.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.200]   So I would wake up before work at 4am, work on one project,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.160]   go to work and work on other projects that work, come home and do even more.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.120]   So I would literally take if I was working on three side hustles and I would
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   split my day to give each the same amount of time.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.040]   Now there were some points when some blew up a little bit more and then I would
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.640]   spend weekends working on those and let the other ones fall behind.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.000]   But one thing I've always vowed to myself is that if I created something that had
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.640]   an audience, whether a podcast, a blog, a newsletter,
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.360]   that I would not let them down.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.880]   And what I mean by that is I would never miss a day when I owed them content.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.040]   So my podcast comes out every Friday, my newsletter every Monday and my blog,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.440]   used to come out every Tuesday. I would never, ever, ever miss a day.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.160]   So if I had something with an audience,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.480]   I always showed up for them no matter what. And I'm still that way.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.880]   And I think when you're building and growing, you need consistency.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.640]   That's everything in branding. And as a content creator,
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.600]   that's what gives you your credibility, especially early on.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.400]   I have a newsletter and it comes out every two weeks and I think I've only
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.360]   missed one and there's at least a good reason behind the one that missed,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.000]   but it forces me to not give it up. Even if it's your passion, right?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.920]   Everyone always says for me, this podcast is a passion of mine.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.000]   This newsletter is that doesn't mean that there are days where you're like, gosh,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.640]   I just need a break. I think the consistency forces you to keep going.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.760]   Otherwise the break you take could go longer than you want.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.400]   Even fulfilling things can be hard.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.080]   Yeah. And also when you're creating content,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.600]   you want some sort of validation and I've learned early on as a writer,
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.520]   you're not going to get people who email you every week and say, good job.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.720]   I love the show. Like that's a bonus.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.400]   But I think if you still really want to take this seriously,
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.360]   you need validation in some sort of way.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.880]   And I've always found that in accountability and being my own accountability
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.280]   buddy. So if I set deadlines, especially as an entrepreneur or a content creator,
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.520]   if I miss those deadlines, that's me failing myself.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.360]   And if I make those deadlines, that's validation, that's accountability.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.640]   And I've always been so firm on that,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.200]   that me showing up is the only ticket I have to my own success.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   Whether or not people are going to praise me for my content,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.720]   it allows me to know that I'm doing the work I need to do.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.360]   That makes sense.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.960]   And I'll give a shout out to a listener here named Darshan who sent me an email.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.480]   It was like, Hey, I know most people write in and complain or ask questions.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.120]   I'm just writing in to say thank you. And I was like, Oh man,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.920]   it feels really good to get those emails because a lot of mediums podcasting,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.640]   especially, it's not really easily a two way street.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.440]   But now let's go back to this first big break, I guess you'd call it.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.920]   You put this ad in Craigslist. What led to you even posting the ad?
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.640]   It's not like there was a bridesmaids for hire business that lots of people
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.680]   were doing and you just wanted to throw your hat in the ring.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.760]   The truth is I had a really bad Friday night and I was rejected from an
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.720]   opportunity and I was feeling down about myself.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.840]   And before that I had all of these friends getting married in my early twenties
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.240]   and I was always a bridesmaid.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.120]   And that same night that I was feeling down about myself,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.160]   I had two friends I hardly spoke to who ironically lived down the street.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.920]   Two of those people on that same Friday night called me up and said, Hey,
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.760]   will you be my bridesmaid? It was so random.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.560]   I was feeling so down about myself. I was venting to my roommate and I said,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   Carrie, what is going on? And she said, Jen, come on, it's obvious.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.920]   These people are asking you because you're good at it.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.800]   You're like some sort of professional.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.400]   And I went home after my roommate had gone out and I just sat there and I was
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.680]   like, you know what? I'm so sick of where I am in my life.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.320]   I'm so sick of feeling stuck. I'm so fed up also about being a bridesmaid.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.680]   Let me do something about it.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.920]   If I'm good at this skill and I have distant friends asking me,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.280]   why not allow strangers to hire me? I didn't know a thing about business.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.760]   I didn't know if this was going to work, but I said to myself, let me try it.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.120]   So I went to craigslist.com, which is a website.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.320]   My mom told me growing up never, ever, ever go to.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.200]   And I posted the anonymous ad basically saying, Hey,
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.800]   if you need help at your wedding as a bridesmaid, I'll be there.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.880]   I'll show up in the dress. I'll walk down the aisle.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.400]   I'll dance with your weird uncle. I'll give the speech.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.280]   I'll help you pee in your wedding dress,
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.320]   which is like actually a hard thing to do. And I posted the ad.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.280]   I went to sleep. I lived my life.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.840]   I didn't even check my email over the weekend. I just figured whatever.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.600]   Nobody saw this Craigslist ad. I go to work Monday morning.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.800]   And I see in my inbox,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.640]   I have hundreds of emails from people all over the world that wanted to hire me.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.480]   Let alone somebody in my office chatted me a link to a Buzzfeed news article
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.240]   about the ad saying, Oh my God, Jen, like this is you.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.560]   Like you're in Buzzfeed.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.840]   And my life literally changed over the course of a weekend without me even
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.680]   knowing it.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.840]   I have so many questions. So I want to dig into both the business side of this,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.680]   but because I think most people don't understand this business,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.280]   what can you just share a little bit about the role,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.400]   why people actually end up hiring you? Some surprising things you've learned.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.440]   People hear this and they're like, this is so weird. Who would want to hire you?
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.040]   And I'm like, okay, just give me a couple seconds and I'll convince you.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.120]   Number one, it's not a wedding planner.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.040]   I don't help you pick your flowers or your dress or your venue.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.200]   I don't do any of that. I am strictly your hired bridesmaid.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   I'm there as the personal assistant running to CVS cause you don't have tissues.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.000]   I'm the social director who plans the bachelorette party and makes it fun.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.760]   I'm the person who is the peacekeeper when the mother-in-law and you are
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.440]   fighting, I'd come between that and break that off.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.920]   And I'm the on-call therapist.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   I'm the one you can call at two in the morning and vent about how stressed you
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.760]   are about your wedding. I am there for the people.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.320]   I'd say there's two types of people who hire me.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.880]   Type number one are people who have friends,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.520]   but they need that professional embedded in their wedding party because their
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.160]   friends are a disaster and they want someone who's going to keep the peace,
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.320]   but also make sure they feel supported. And on the flip side,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.240]   I have the person who hires me because they don't have any friends.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.760]   And I know that sounds bizarre,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.000]   but the truth is a lot of people out there don't have close,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.800]   solid relationships. And when you get married, you need that support system.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.120]   You need that person who's going to be there for you emotionally,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.720]   mentally, and physically before your wedding. And on the day of,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.480]   I am your bridesmaid. So what does that mean? While I wear the dress,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.160]   I walk down the aisle, I dance on the dance floor. But aside from that,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.800]   I also pretend to be a part of your life. So oftentimes I have a fake name,
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.240]   a fake backstory, and nobody in your life knows I'm hired.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.760]   Sometimes not even the person you are marrying.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.280]   So I take on that role as your friend. And I've been doing this for seven years.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.000]   People called it crazy. Some people called it brilliant.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.360]   I always called it a must need.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.560]   And I remember doing my first wedding ever for a woman named Ashley from Maple
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.800]   Grove, Minnesota. I remember flying there, getting off the plane,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.200]   thinking what are you about to do?
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.440]   You're about to show up at a stranger's wedding. Are you crazy?
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.280]   And when I got back on the plane to go back to New York, I remember thinking,
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.640]   Jen, this is something,
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.760]   and this is something that's going to be incredibly important to so many people's
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.600]   lives.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.200]   And that's sort of why I started it and why I keep doing it till this day.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.000]   I want to go two directions here. So I'll ask first,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.680]   what are some of the fun, surprising things you've seen or learned?
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.640]   I always say that I'm a person who never liked weddings.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.960]   I was never a person who planned a dream wedding.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.440]   I could never care about my own wedding. I still don't like weddings.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.200]   I think why I do this job is because I love helping strangers and chaotic
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.400]   situations. And that's what weddings are.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.440]   I've learned so much about humans and love and
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.160]   relationship on this job that has completely reshaped how I think about humanity
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.480]   and both good ways and not so good ways.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.400]   One thing I like to talk about that nobody really will mention is that cold feet
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.680]   is an absolute real thing that happens to many people on their wedding day.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.840]   I call it the diving board effect.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.360]   We're right before they're about to walk down the aisle.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.920]   They know whether or not they're making a mistake.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.360]   And these are people who might not have known before,
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.400]   but in that moment they know if you ask a lot of people who got divorced within
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.040]   the first year or so after their wedding, they will tell you,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.960]   they knew in that moment they were making a mistake.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.000]   And this is something so fascinating because a big part of my job is helping
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.480]   people when they have cold feet, whether a week before a month before,
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.640]   or five minutes before. So watching cold feet,
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.120]   something that you only see on TV actually be real was incredibly
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.320]   fascinating to me and difficult to handle at first.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.160]   The other thing that I've learned too,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.920]   which is a little different and difficult to mention is that a lot of people
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.400]   don't get married for love.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.440]   A lot of people get married for love and something else.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.880]   Pretty much all of us get married for love and something else.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.080]   Some people don't get married for love at all,
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.000]   but some people get married for the and part,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.840]   which might be financial security or might be because that person's going to
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.680]   provide them with a certain lifestyle or because they're at a certain age and
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.160]   this is just what they want to do.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.880]   And I have heard a lot of people admit to me candidly what that and is.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   And that was fascinating to me as well.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.680]   I always thought people just had like fairytale romances.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.600]   And when I met my future husband back in the day,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.640]   I started to realize that this was true. You fall in love,
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.800]   but what gets you to that finish line of marriage is always the and whatever
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.000]   that part is, whether positive or negative.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.200]   And you said some people don't even have the love part. Yeah.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.840]   Does that work out?
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.000]   And now you've been doing this long enough that you can see the end result.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.160]   It's crazy. Cause a lot of people will say,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   you must be so good at knowing if a couple's going to make it.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.800]   But the truth is you could never, ever,
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.600]   ever judge anybody else's relationship because people stay in relationships,
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.160]   just like they enter relationships for different reasons.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.280]   So just because you think your friends out there are not going to make it,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.920]   whatever type of relationship they have might be exactly what they're looking
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.880]   for and what they want.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.480]   And it might be something so different than what you want.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   So a lot of people who are getting married because they want that person's
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.160]   money or because of whatever that reason is,
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.760]   they end up do staying together and it's because they got what they wanted and
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.880]   the other person got what they wanted as well.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.520]   And while it might be very different than what I want, it works for them.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.720]   So I think it is so hard to know if a couple is going to make it.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.880]   When I played this game at weddings, the couples I was like, Oh,
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.280]   they're going to be together forever, two years in are divorced.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.520]   So you don't really know.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.160]   That's fascinating because I have some of those thoughts in my head, you know,
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.400]   Oh, that couple, they argue a lot or all this stuff.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.040]   And so far I'm not anywhere close to being predictive of that behavior.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.080]   Yeah. It might be their communication style.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.600]   I can't tell you the amount of couples that right before they walked down the
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.000]   aisle, they're screaming at each other, they're cursing.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.280]   And while that's like not healthy and not good,
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.760]   that's their communication style.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.880]   That's how they work.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.440]   And for some odd reason, it just works for them.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.720]   Cold feet is one thing and then calling it off as another.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.560]   Has that ever happened?
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.320]   Many times.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.280]   I've actually been hired a couple of times to end engagements where the person had
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.680]   nobody in their life they could ask for that help from.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.920]   So they'll call me up and we'll talk about the steps they need to take to get out
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.920]   of the engagement because they're scared to tell their parents or they're scared
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.000]   to tell their friends and they need that unbiased support system.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.600]   But I've also been at weddings where they don't want to do it,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.280]   where the bride tells me that she hates the groom and she wants out right now.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.120]   And my perspective, which is different than a friend
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.840]   or a family member, is I really want what's best for you.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.880]   Yeah, your friends and family want that, too.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.600]   But in the moment when the spotlight is on, they just don't want you to be embarrassed.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.840]   They just want you to do whatever you can do to just get this moment over with.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.680]   So I've had a lot of people who we've had to end the wedding.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.920]   I've had people who go through with the wedding, but they don't legally get married.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.240]   But that's happened a lot.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.640]   And that is not something I thought I'd have to deal with when I started the business.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.960]   This is wild.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.800]   And you said you've learned a lot about relationships.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.040]   Obviously, you haven't learned how to predict divorce.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.960]   But what are things that you've learned that people listening
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.640]   could apply to their own relationship?
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.280]   I always thought because of this job, I would never want to get married anymore
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.960]   just because I've seen so much.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.160]   And when I started dating my now husband, I said to him after he proposed,
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.680]   we're going to do things differently.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.200]   And I wasn't talking about the wedding.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.280]   I was talking about what we had to do before we got married.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.560]   I wanted to make sure we had all the checks and balances in place
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.280]   so that I knew that this was the right move for my life.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.320]   So I made us meet with a divorce lawyer to talk about prenums
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.440]   and what that would look like.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.000]   And if we want one, we didn't end up getting one.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.480]   But I can absolutely see why that's so important.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.120]   And you can get a postnum, which I never knew about.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.080]   We talked to a financial advisor to talk about what we should do with our finances.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.960]   And we didn't end up combining finances,
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.120]   but we went through the process of understanding that.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.800]   We went to a marriage counselor to talk about why marriages fail.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.920]   I literally was like, if you want to marry me,
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.880]   we are meeting with all of these professionals that people meet with
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.600]   once the marriage starts to go downhill before we get married.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.400]   And I wanted us to have education on what marriage is and what changes
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.320]   and all of these things.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.160]   And while he was like so freaked out and was just like,
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.320]   can't you be normal and enjoy our engagement?
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.840]   It helped me feel prepared.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.280]   And I think a lot of couples have conversations,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.320]   but they don't really go through these motions before they get married
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.160]   because nobody tells you it's OK to or that you should.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.120]   Everybody in life sets you up to find love.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.560]   They teach you how to date.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.720]   Everyone helps you plan a wedding, but nobody helps you once you get married.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.600]   You're just supposed to figure it out.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.680]   And I didn't want us to figure it out.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.240]   And that was something I've learned from the job is before you get married,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.160]   go through a lot of these really tough conversations.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.280]   And then once you get married, things might be a little easier for you.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.320]   Even if you are married and haven't gotten into them, right?
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.880]   Let's say you're thinking about having kids.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.240]   You could go talk to a marriage counselor and say, hey,
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.840]   what are the problems that we're going to face when this happens?
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.640]   What do you see?
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.320]   And what can we do now to find out how we would handle them
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.480]   and how we could do better?
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   We're proactive with so many things in our life
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.120]   that matter, like our health or sometimes our careers.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.440]   But we're not always so proactive with relationships.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.960]   And that's what I've really tried to be with my partner is
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.600]   we don't really have a ton of big problems now.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.960]   We have our standard problems.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.120]   But what can we know so that when we start to get into those problem areas,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.720]   we know the tools that we can turn to and we know what to do.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.120]   We're by no means perfect.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.160]   But I think a combination of therapy and curiosity and meeting
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.480]   with a lot of these professionals has really helped us
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.760]   at least have these conversations in a neutral playing field
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.280]   rather than an awkward, hey, things are getting a little bad between us.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.200]   What should we do now?
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   Because it's very hard to rise to the occasion
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.080]   when your relationship is starting to go downhill.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.720]   Being a parent can be scary, whether it's watching your toddler
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.440]   jump on your new couch naked during potty training
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.720]   or the indescribable pain of stepping on tiny plastic dinosaurs
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.360]   in your bare feet, both of which happened to me recently.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.680]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary is getting life insurance,
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.120]   especially when you do it with Fabric, who I'm excited to partner
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.280]   with for this episode.

[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.560]   And when I say surprisingly affordable, I actually went online
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.360]   to compare prices and found Fabric to be highly competitive
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.560]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage

[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.600]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.440]   not available in certain states.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.040]   Price is subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.920]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.440]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.200]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.280]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.240]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.680]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.760]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.840]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.000]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.440]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.160]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.200]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.240]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.920]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.920]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection of beer,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.200]   wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.600]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.880]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.240]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.240]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to Drizly.com.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.160]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.520]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.840]   So getting back to the business side of this,
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.680]   what advice do you have for someone trying to figure out
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.640]   what could be their side hustle?
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.080]   I think the important thing is think about what you're getting asked
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.760]   to do constantly in your life.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.040]   What are your friends asking you for help with?
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.160]   What are the things that you're spending your quality time doing?
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.480]   And if that's just reading different Reddit boards or reading certain books
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.480]   or watching certain TV shows or caring about certain hobbies,
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.560]   what are those things and can you monetize them?
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.720]   I've literally tried to monetize everything I love in this life.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.200]   And while that might sound like really creepy or cheesy, it works for me.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.000]   But I think what are the things that you enjoy?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.200]   What are the things that people consider you an unofficial expert in?
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.760]   And what are the businesses or side hustles that you would want to spend
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.560]   all day, Saturday and Sunday doing?
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.800]   Once you start to think about that, you might come closer to an idea.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.640]   The other thing to think about that I love to do is start tracking problems
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.120]   that you have every single day.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.840]   What are the many problems you have from the second you wake up
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.440]   till the time you go to sleep?
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.360]   Businesses are created because of problems need to be solved.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.520]   And if you start monitoring and figuring out
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.960]   what the common problems you or your friends have,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.920]   you might find yourself a really cool untapped business idea.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.240]   Where are you tracking these?
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.080]   Are you writing business ideas and problems down in a notebook?
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.280]   What's your method?
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.360]   I'm a paper and pencil kind of person.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.600]   I don't really like a lot of technology and apps.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.520]   If you saw my desk right now, I have a stack of papers and I use that.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.160]   There's also a great website called notepd.com
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.200]   where you can write 10 ideas a day.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.000]   It's like a community.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.600]   They can comment on it and it's free and people can add to your idea list.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.640]   You can scan a site like that or read it or other places and write down
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.560]   a list of so many business ideas just on what people are venting about.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.160]   When I think about how to expand Bridesmaid for Hire,
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.080]   I often go on wedding forums or in wedding Facebook groups,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.760]   and I just read what problems people have and how they're trying to solve them.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.760]   And then I think of a digital product or something that I could offer
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.800]   that taps into that.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.880]   When you're coming up with ideas,
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.920]   what advice do you have for someone who's stuck?
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.320]   If you're stuck with your own ideas, get out of your own head.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.560]   So what does that mean?
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.680]   Number one, find people in your life and just casually have a conversation.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.720]   I was telling Chris that my personal friends are like really annoyed by me
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.560]   because all I do when I see them is ask them questions.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.280]   So I'll say to them like, Hey, what do you have an idea about this?
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.400]   This is my business idea. This is my newsletter idea.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.160]   What do you think? Give me some ideas.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.520]   And I'll write down their ideas and maybe I won't use them,
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.560]   but it'll get me thinking a different way.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.800]   Sometimes when I'm feeling stuck, I just force myself through it.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.240]   And I've learned this as a writer.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.640]   There's no such thing as writer's block when you're on a tight deadline
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.000]   to finish a book that you're getting paid to do, you have to write.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.040]   So sometimes you just force yourself through it.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.200]   Open up a Word doc,
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.840]   take out a piece of paper and pen and just force yourself to get ideas down.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.760]   James Altager is a big proponent of the ten ideas a day method,
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.920]   which is a game changer.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.000]   So let's say you're like, OK,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.920]   I'm feeling stuck about a new product to launch in my business.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.960]   Great. Write ten ideas.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.160]   Likely you're going to get to idea four and then really start to feel fatigued.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.720]   Then you'll get to seven and you'll feel like you can never add to that list.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.160]   Usually ideas eight, nine and ten are the brilliant ones
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.320]   because you have to push this.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.560]   You have to exercise that muscle.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.280]   So either I reach out to other people and ask for their opinion
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.360]   or I force myself through that feeling of stuck by just doing.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.200]   And any type of motion you can put in your life,
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.640]   whether it's in your body or just in your settings or how you live
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.760]   your life will change your thought process.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.480]   So if I can't figure out what to write or if I'm feeling stuck,
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.440]   if I go for a walk or if I change my location
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.120]   or if I change something about what's in my atmosphere,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.280]   usually that feeling of stuck changes, too.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.360]   How did you first decide how much to charge someone to be their bridesmaid?
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.560]   And there wasn't a market for it.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.840]   I'm going to be so honest with you.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.880]   I was a poetry major.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.000]   I was working at a startup.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.120]   I had no idea.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.520]   Literally, when the ad went viral, I went on national TV, live TV,
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.400]   and they asked me how much this cost.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.880]   And I said, Cos, this is a free service.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.680]   I want to do this for free.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.360]   And my brother, who's like in the business world, was like,
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.000]   what did you just do?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.040]   And this is not going to be free.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.240]   And to be honest with you, I didn't know how much to charge,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.160]   but I found a different type of vendor in the wedding industry
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.360]   that I was closest to.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.480]   So I looked at wedding planners and they have coordinators
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.960]   and were very different, but I looked at their pricing model.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.000]   I saw how much they charged, how they structured their packages.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.840]   And I modeled it off of that.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.360]   Even then, my pricing was far too low.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.200]   And after I worked a ton of weddings, I would come home and raise my prices
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.520]   by five dollars, ten dollars just because I was exhausted.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   So I think pricing is something that will take time to figure out.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.160]   But you can do research, look at any other competitors that you have,
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.120]   figure out who your target audience is so you can match a price
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.760]   to your target audience and how much disposable income
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.480]   they might have to spend on your product or your service.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.360]   And the other thing to start to figure out is your operating costs.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.840]   A lot of my operating costs are my time spent on these phone calls
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.440]   or me getting to the wedding or my downtime when I'm not working in the wedding
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.240]   or also being out on my own.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.840]   I have to pay health insurance and all of these things can factor into your pricing.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.920]   But I was the one that never had any business training, any advice on what to do.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.000]   I have learned and all of my success that I have had
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.840]   is because of all of the mistakes that I have made on my own costly mistakes.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.520]   And if you went back in time,
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.480]   where would you start setting your price now if you could do it all over again?
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.400]   If I could go back in time, I would say to myself, Jen,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.520]   even though you don't think you are worth this price, let me tell you,
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.280]   you don't know your worth because you are too deep in the business to know better.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.800]   So I want you to double, if not triple what you were charging.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.640]   I think I first started off in 2014 charging under a thousand dollars
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.600]   for this service, which is ludicrous because the amount of time
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.440]   and energy and resources that go into this.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.000]   And now I'm closer to the three thousand dollar mark for the baseline package,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.840]   which I think is a really good price for the service.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.560]   So I wish I would have tripled my price and said, you know what, Jen,
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.960]   you might not feel like this is what you should charge,
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.240]   but the value you're giving is extraordinary and people will pay it.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.720]   We're always so scared that if we raise our prices
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.160]   or we price something higher than competitors, nobody will come to us.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.080]   But that's where branding and marketing and sales tools come into play.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   And I wish I had the confidence to do that.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.960]   And I'll be honest with you, even now, I'm so scared to raise my prices.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.720]   I do made of honor speech writing.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.280]   And I had a client say at the end of working with me,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.200]   I just want to let you know you are completely undercharging.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.160]   You should triple your prices.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.400]   And I said to her, wow, I appreciate that feedback.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.440]   But inside, I'm a bit of a scaredy cat because that price points working for me.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.320]   I'm getting business.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.360]   If I raise it, I might lose business.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.760]   So even till this day, it's a confidence issue more than anything else.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.680]   So do you think you're going to raise your prices now that you've had that feedback?
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.600]   Absolutely, because not only did a client have to tell me,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.320]   but I've had business mentors and just friends tell me that I'm charging too little.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.800]   And I think it took the words of a client to make me think, you know what?
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.200]   I asked her, OK, how much would you pay?
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.240]   So I think that's good feedback is once you've worked with clients
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.480]   or you've had people buy your product is to send out a survey and say, hey,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.600]   how much would you have paid for this and get their honest advice?
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.080]   And have you changed your price since?
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.600]   To be honest with you, this phone call was two days ago,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.200]   and I haven't changed it since, but I'm working on it.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.080]   I'm working on it.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.160]   OK, that's a good question, though. I like it.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.400]   I need this accountability, Chris. This is good.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.080]   Well, why don't you just commit to change the price before the end of the weekend?
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.040]   I'm going to because I'm launching a new website for Bites Me for Hire,
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.880]   and I'm going to go do it.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.760]   I'm not going to triple it.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.920]   I'll be honest with you, but I will tack on a couple hundred.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.400]   And when it comes to marketing, not everyone will launch a crazy side hustle
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.440]   and go on national television in a matter of days.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.760]   So let's shelve that tactic.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.120]   But you've launched a lot of other lines of business, side hustle, sources of income.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.000]   What advice do you have for people to just get them out there?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.040]   I think number one is you have to think about how to be different.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.240]   There's so many people out there who are starting another podcast,
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.200]   another wedding business, another this, another that.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.120]   Your branding, your voice, everything has to be different.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.080]   You have to differentiate yourself from all of the noise.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.320]   If not, the marketing is going to feel impossible.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.680]   So think about how you can do things differently,
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.280]   how you can do things like nobody else has done them before.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.200]   Number two, tap into any resources that are currently
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.000]   where your audience are spending a ton of time.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.720]   There's so many people right now who are so against TikTok
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.040]   because they think it's for the young people or whatever.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.960]   But the truth is, everyone's on TikTok.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.080]   TikTok is the fastest growing way that you can blow up right now
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.920]   for free, not even spending a penny.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.800]   Tap into that.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.960]   When we're doing marketing, we all look for a downloadable plan
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.480]   off the Internet of what we can do to market ourselves.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.120]   And that downloadable plan will tell you Instagram, Facebook ads.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.160]   None of that is going to work because it's oversaturated
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.560]   and your growth rate will be very, very low.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.920]   Go to the places that are new, that are fresh,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   that your audience is spending a lot of time on.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.160]   Number two, press is great because it gets the word out there for you for free.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.680]   So it's like advertising, but you don't have to pay for it.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.280]   How do you do your own press?
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.320]   There's two free websites that everybody should sign up for
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.520]   because they're absolutely free and the press comes to you.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.800]   What I mean by that is every day you'll get a list of sources
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.960]   that news reporters need to talk to.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.720]   And if you are a source, you'll end up in these articles for free.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.400]   One of those websites is called helpareporterout.com
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.360]   and the other is called Quoted, Q-W-O-T-E-D.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.480]   The press is coming to you.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.160]   So get on those two websites as a source.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.960]   Press is great, again, because it spreads your name.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.000]   You don't have to pay for it.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.400]   So that's a good marketing channel.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.520]   Social media is good as long as you're not doing social media
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.160]   like everybody else, because most people are doing it wrong.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.560]   And the third way is to create some sort of free value content stream.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.920]   Rather than just be a business, be a brand.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.960]   You also have to be a content creator.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   So consider a newsletter, consider a podcast, consider a video series,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.000]   but make it fresh, make it interesting, make it something
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.840]   where after the person reads it, watches it or listens to it,
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.920]   they walk away and go, "Whoa, I cannot stop thinking about that."
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.440]   How do you find that idea?
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.680]   Because I think it's easy to say,
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.040]   write something that people stop in their tracks when they see.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.320]   But you're a writer.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.160]   What tips do you have for someone who's like, "I don't know what that is"?
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.200]   You need to wear the shoes of your audience, because a lot of times
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.840]   we start businesses and brands for people who aren't us
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.200]   or who were just one of that audience.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.360]   So you need to embed yourself with that audience.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.160]   Number one, join Facebook groups, Slack channels, Discord groups
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.240]   where your audience hangs out and virtually stalk them.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.800]   Read what they're talking about.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.240]   Read how they're saying things.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.760]   Read what problems they have.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.600]   Get to know them from that level.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.120]   And that will really help you feel like you start to understand
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.200]   who you're marketing to and who you're talking to.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.120]   Next, look at all your competitors and what they're doing.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.400]   Find the similarities in what they're doing and try to do the opposite,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   because you will be surprised how doing the opposite of what they're doing
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.960]   might give you traction and might impress your audience
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.080]   in a really unique kind of way.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.160]   The third thing to think about is what can you put out there
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:04.320]   that is going to let people feel smarter, more inspired and entertained?
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.800]   All good content has that in there.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.640]   So if you're not sure, think number one.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.680]   Okay, what will my audience need to hear or read
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.320]   that would let them feel smarter about this topic?
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.520]   So if you're selling mattresses, okay, what would your audience
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.200]   need to know about mattresses that would make them feel that way?
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.520]   What would they need to know that would make them entertained and inspired?
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.400]   And if we can start to answer these questions, what we're putting out there
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.720]   will attract the people we want to attract.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.000]   That's fantastic.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.040]   So how did you end up making the decision to take this thing
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.000]   that you started on a whim on a Friday afternoon and say, "Okay, I've done this.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.280]   I used to think I should do it for free.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.120]   I'm getting paid. Now this is my full time business.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.640]   This is me. I'm not going to look for a day job.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.240]   I'm not going to look for steady W2 income.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.320]   I'm going all in on myself."
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.760]   I was a bit of a coward, I guess, because I really didn't.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.440]   I waited till I was laid off from my full time job.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.520]   I'll never forget my boss calling me in and said, "We're having a massive layoff
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.000]   and I'm letting you go first because I don't think you should be here anymore."
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.280]   And I remember being devastated by that because I love the steady stream of income.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.960]   Again, I did my job so quick.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.920]   I did it really well.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.440]   And I had all the free time in the world
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.560]   and I was getting paid like $70,000 to do it back then.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.600]   So I was so devastated.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.120]   And I remember packing my bags and exiting the door.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.160]   And as the front door hit me in the behind, I said to myself, "Jen,
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.480]   you are never going to work for somebody else ever again, ever again."
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.040]   And to make that happen, we will figure out what we have to do to pay our bills.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.080]   And I went home and I devised a plan that said, OK,
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.240]   we're going to take Bridesmaids for Hire to the next level.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.840]   We'll figure out what that means.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.160]   We're also going to tap into the other little side
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.120]   hustles that you had sort of done when you worked full time,
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.600]   like freelance writing and book writing and all of these things.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.880]   And we're going to make it work.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.640]   We're going to figure it out.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.720]   But that was the moment where I said, "I can't work for somebody else
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.560]   because you know what? I'm not a good employee.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.800]   I don't want to just do my job.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.280]   I want to do other things.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.240]   And I will never be happy in a corporate environment."
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.440]   And I made that decision.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.920]   And honestly, in full honesty and transparency, it is not easy
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.800]   because every month I have a certain income goal of what I want to make.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.440]   And sometimes you don't hit that and sometimes you do.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.440]   And it's very inconsistent and it's hard.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.880]   One month, you know, one side hustle or one business is taking off
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.840]   and the rest are failing.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.720]   And during the pandemic, all of them are failing and you start to panic.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.840]   So it's definitely a lifestyle where you are on your toes.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.760]   And some days you find yourself thinking, "Huh, would it be easier
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.040]   just to collect a paycheck?"
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.320]   And I do think that sometimes.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.920]   But I just know that my happiness lies in me
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.400]   being able to run wild and free with these crazy ideas.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.280]   When you were deciding Bridesmaids for Hire, let's make this a thing.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.920]   You mentioned you also looked at, "OK, what about writing and books?"
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.160]   Did a part of you say, "What if Bridesmaids for Hire could just be the one thing?"
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.560]   I always thought that Bridesmaids for Hire would never be the only thing
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.360]   because that wouldn't make me happy.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.800]   I am somebody who has known from a very early age
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.600]   that there's two categories of things that I am meant to do.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.720]   One of them is write in any capacity.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.280]   I've known since I was four years old, I wanted to be a writer.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.840]   And the other is speak to inspire.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.200]   I've always wanted to be this inspirational speaker.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.920]   So when I started Bridesmaids for Hire, I sort of turned both of those things
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.720]   into the gig.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.320]   I wrote maid of honor speeches and I spoke and I inspired and I helped people.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.680]   But I always knew I had to do other things with those passions.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.600]   My other passion was always being able to support people
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.960]   when they were going through really challenging situations.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.400]   That's always been my target audience are people who are
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.880]   not feeling great about their lives and me being that person
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.600]   that could hopefully pick them up.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.000]   So knowing that those are my passions always led me to figure out other things.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.640]   But no, I never thought Bridesmaids for Hire would be my only thing
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.760]   because it wouldn't make me happy.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.680]   So two of the side hustles you spun up probably because of the passions
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.760]   you just talked about were coaching and speaking.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.480]   And I hear a lot of people talk about, "I like advising people.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.520]   Coaching would be fun." Some people turn that into a full time gig.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.560]   But how did you even get started in those two areas?
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.480]   And what advice do you have for people who are interested in them?
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.320]   I remember graduating college with a poetry degree
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.360]   and people would ask me what I wanted to do next.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.440]   And I said, "I want to be a motivational speaker."
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.800]   And so many mentors and people older than me were like, "Cool,
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.160]   but you have nothing to speak about.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.120]   You're 22. You haven't lived a life."
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.960]   And I was offended by that because I thought I had lived a life at 22,
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.560]   but perhaps they were right.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.760]   But as I built my career, as I got laid off, as I built Bridesmaid for Hire,
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.960]   as I wrote books, as I did all of these things,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.120]   I felt like I had more life experiences.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.760]   And that led to a lot of people knocking on my door and asking for help
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.480]   and asking for advice and asking how to launch this or that.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.320]   And I decided rather than doing these one off free chats
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.320]   or rather than speaking and teaching at a school,
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.080]   why not offer coaching so it can be more personalized?
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.760]   So I think I got the confidence to offer coaching as a service
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.680]   once I started to get a steady stream of maybe 10 plus people a month
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.880]   reaching out for some sort of help.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.680]   And I got to do more speaking just by figuring out, OK, what was my keynote?
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.720]   What was I going to bring to the table at all of these conferences?
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.000]   And a lot of what I spoke about was how to take a crazy idea
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.160]   and turn it into a side hustle or how to market using no money
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.800]   or how to do your own PR.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.680]   I tapped into all of these skills that I figured out
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.080]   by starting Bridesmaid for Hire and running with it.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.400]   So I guess that person at 22 was right.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.200]   I really didn't know what to speak about or coach back then.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.400]   But through these experiences, I built the confidence to launch that.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   And these are things I still do till this day.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.040]   And some seasons are busier and some seasons aren't.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.440]   And that's the cool thing about juggling multiple streams of income,
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.840]   multiple side hustles, is that some seasons you'll run with three
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.560]   out of seven of them and then the other season that will change.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.120]   That's both stressful and exciting.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.680]   And that summarizes, I really believe, my personal life and journey
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.240]   as an entrepreneur.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.440]   Before I do any interview, I like to go find an episode of a podcast
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.400]   where someone's been interviewed and just kind of get a sense of their vibe.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.440]   And I saw a bunch of you on one show and I was like, "Gosh,
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.880]   why is she going on the James Altucher show so many times?"
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.360]   And so I looked and you'd started this coaching series
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.080]   where you publicly were being coached.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.600]   It was called Make You A Millionaire.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.280]   I only listed the first one so far.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.040]   The goal was in six to 12 months, you were going to go through this
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.080]   coaching series and build your business up.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.280]   How has that gone? What have you learned?
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.120]   I've been a fan of James Altucher for so many years.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.840]   I've loved his style.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.640]   I saw somewhere that he had posted he was taking on these mentorees
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.600]   for his podcast, and I wrote an email.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.720]   I reached out and never thought I'd hear back from him.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.760]   I got an email within a couple of minutes being accepted to the show.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.800]   We filmed the next day.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.040]   I opened up my entire life on that episode.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.960]   And I remember thinking, "What did I just do?"
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.440]   I was so nervous because I figured a huge audience of people would hear it.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.320]   I was so vulnerable in a way I had never been before.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.440]   And frankly, I was quite terrified.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:56.320]   Not only that, but if you know James, you know that he has a lot of ideas,
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.160]   big ideas, scary ideas, things I've never done before.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.000]   And I wanted to do everything that he said
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.240]   because I really did view him as that mentor.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.320]   So he threw me into a world where I was already doing so much.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.280]   And now he gave me five other things to start to do.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.520]   He had me start two newsletters, a product, all of these things.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.440]   And it was a complete game changer.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.960]   Did I make a million dollars from any of it?
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.280]   No. Am I close to that? No.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.400]   But what it did help me figure out is other places and other things
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.880]   to tap into that I normally never, ever would have thought to do
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.080]   or would have thought about.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.240]   I'm somebody who for the past seven years, I've been my own boss.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.640]   I'm a team of one.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.120]   I am the brainpower of everything I do.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.880]   And sometimes that's not enough or that's stale.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.560]   But listening to somebody say, hey, do this, do this, do this, do this
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.000]   got me out of a funk and forced me into all of these different worlds
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.360]   that taught me something new.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.840]   I learned how to use Substack.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.880]   I launched a product on Kickstarter.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.800]   I created a card game, something I'd wanted to do, but had no idea what to do.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.720]   I created a website where people can be human billboards.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.360]   I just did everything.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.320]   And I felt like I had no risk because I almost felt like
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.720]   I was doing these things to show him.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.520]   And it was almost like a fun experiment.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.120]   So I felt risk free.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.960]   Whereas in my own life, taking those risks is harder
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.840]   because I'm always so worried about making money.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.800]   So I start to sort of put those risks aside and focus on things
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.040]   that are going to make me money.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.840]   But working with him on this podcast and this experiment
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.840]   forced me to try new things that I hadn't done in a while.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.320]   I want to ask about a few of them, because Kickstarter is a great example.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.320]   Everyone listening has probably found some interesting project there.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.240]   What would you say about that experience?
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.680]   If someone has an interesting idea of something to build?
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.040]   Was that a good, positive experience?
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.160]   I really liked the Kickstarter platform in the sense of it
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.680]   gives you a great landing page.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.520]   You can film a video about your product.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.040]   You could offer different tiers.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.160]   And it's a great place to send people to to hopefully invest in your product.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   And if you reach the goal, you have the product will get made
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.040]   and they'll get the product they bought.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.560]   And if you don't, they get their money back.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.840]   So it's a little bit risk free for your audience.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.160]   However, what I am learning about everything in life is just because
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.120]   you're on a website like Kickstarter or you're on another type of website
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.920]   like that, it doesn't mean you're going to get organic traffic.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.000]   So you still have to market no matter what you start in this world,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.640]   whether you release a podcast, a book, a product, a business.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.880]   Having marketing skills is so essential.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   So the Kickstarter was great for a lot of those resources.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.120]   But I still had to do a ton of hands on marketing.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.600]   I still had to think about how am I going to make this go viral?
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.720]   I still had to figure out how to post this on Instagram or talk about it
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.880]   on the podcast or get people to share it in order to get people to that page.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.920]   That was all me and not so much Kickstarter.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.400]   And I think a lot of people think
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.800]   if you have a Kickstarter page, that Kickstarter will send you traffic.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.920]   And that could be true,
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.040]   especially if you have a very viral idea or a really awesome video.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.200]   That could happen.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.680]   But for me, it required a lot of marketing.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.240]   I liked it because it gave me the confidence to produce a product
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.520]   that I was very, very scared to release.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.160]   It also gave me the funds to go off and release it
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.280]   without having to tap into my own money.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.440]   So there were a lot of benefits to releasing something on Kickstarter.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.720]   Also, all I needed was a proof of concept.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.640]   As I got the Kickstarter up and running, that's when I designed the card deck.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.920]   That's when I wrote the cards.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.520]   That's when I figured out how to produce it.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.680]   So it gave me some lead time to actually put it out there in the world.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.320]   And it's out there.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.480]   You hit your goal. People can buy the cards.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.000]   I doubled the goal.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.320]   I funded it 200%, which was cool.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.800]   And I've released the card game.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.640]   I'm practically sold out with the first release of it.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.560]   I'm reordering it right now.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.640]   It's been an amazing, amazing thing to do
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.760]   because I've always wanted to create a physical product.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:45.160]   My entire career has been services or books or nothing like a product of my own.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.880]   And creating this card deck was the first one that I've done.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.480]   And it's a cool learning experience.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.880]   I'm learning how to sell on Amazon.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.120]   I'm learning how to talk to retailers and get it there.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.520]   I'm learning about e-commerce.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.440]   Like I'm learning about all of these things that I've always wanted to learn,
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.840]   but I didn't have an excuse to.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.600]   And that was the cool part about working with James
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:05.600]   is he gave me an excuse to learn different softwares and platforms
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.880]   and put out different ideas out there that I think I would have been too scared to do.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.280]   If you're a person who wants to start a side hustle
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.040]   or you want to go out on your own and be an entrepreneur,
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.920]   people always talk about the importance of having mentors and people to turn to.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.200]   And I never really had any of that.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.840]   But you get to points in your career where it's so essential
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.880]   because your brain can only take you so far
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.560]   and feeding off of the ideas of people you trust,
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.640]   whether they're in your industry or not,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.840]   can really help you get out of a certain place where your brain is locked.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.480]   I've been fortunate to have mentors throughout my career.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.560]   But oftentimes, they're not necessarily people that you might think are mentors.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.720]   Like one of my closest friends is a mentor for a certain area of my life.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.320]   And I would say don't always write off who could be a mentor
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.120]   because sometimes what you need is just someone with a different perspective.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.600]   And that doesn't need to always be someone who's done it a thousand times.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.080]   It could just be someone whose opinion you respect.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:05.480]   And oftentimes, I personally think the most valuable trait of a mentor
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.960]   is that you respect their opinion.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.760]   Because if you don't respect their opinion,
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.200]   a lot of their feedback isn't going to be taken to heart.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.200]   And if you're not going to take the feedback,
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.600]   then the relationship doesn't always work.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.760]   I like how you said you have a mentor for a certain part of your life.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.960]   And I find that to be true.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.840]   My true first ever mentor, and I write about this in my book,
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.040]   was an 86-year-old man that I met on the internet
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.920]   because I googled "free business help".
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.440]   And I found this guy, met him at a library.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.800]   He didn't even know what a bridesmaid was.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.600]   And I went back to him every single Saturday for two years.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.240]   I realized I wasn't going to him for business advice
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.680]   because frankly, he wasn't giving me that.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.960]   But he was mentoring me on how to be tough.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.000]   And he was mentoring me on how to have mental strength and resilience
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.280]   and how to stand up for myself
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   and how to have really tough conversations in the business world.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.880]   And I was going to him for different reasons.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.200]   I thought I was going to him for how to scale a business
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.320]   and write a business plan.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.360]   But truthfully, what I got out of him
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.120]   was something I never knew I needed,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.480]   but during that time, got me through that.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.280]   And I think it's the same thing with James.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.840]   I started the podcast with him because I needed business advice,
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.960]   but really what he taught me is how to have fun,
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.040]   how to have experiments, how to think outside of the box.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.760]   Things I was greatly missing in my life.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.000]   So you're right, don't write off people.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.600]   And sometimes find a mentor who knows nothing about your industry,
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.920]   nothing about what you're doing,
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.000]   because you might take so much from them
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.720]   that somebody who's a seasoned vet in what you're doing
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.120]   might pass over and not even know to tell you.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.600]   So what were the lessons from this man about grit and resilience
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.080]   that made that possible?
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.280]   I found that early on when I started Bridesmaid for Hire,
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.440]   I was in all of these different negotiations and business contract meetings.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.120]   And I was trying to pitch a TV show.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.960]   And I was so scared to stand up for what I wanted.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.840]   And I remember we would do a lot of role playing.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.960]   And one time he got out his keys and he said to me,
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.800]   if you're ever in a negotiation
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.320]   and they don't like what you're bringing to the table or they say no to you,
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.520]   you just drop your keys and you say to them, that's my final offer.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.840]   If you decline it, I'm picking up these keys and I'm never speaking to you again.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.760]   This was a really tough guy and maybe some of his advice wasn't perfect,
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.360]   but it really toughened me up.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.280]   And it showed me that I need to figure out
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.840]   how to push my scaredness away and my fear away
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.120]   and step up to these conversations like I've been there before.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.640]   And I know how much value I'm bringing.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:27.560]   I'm somebody who you might not realize this from hearing me on podcasts,
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.800]   but I'm really shy, like in real life.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.560]   I'm really, really shy.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.240]   So when I found myself in a lot of these business conversations,
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.600]   I had imposter syndrome.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.680]   I was just shy.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.040]   I didn't think I was good enough.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   And this guy, I think, really toughened me up.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.760]   And through role playing, he would fix my language.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.280]   He would fix my body language.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.560]   And he would really just teach me how to bring myself there in a room.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.320]   Sometimes the people who scared me like crazy.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.960]   And it's really made me, I swear to you, till this day,
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.640]   I could walk in a room of anybody, the most famous person in the world.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.800]   And I won't let it faze me.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.840]   You would never know that I'm scared.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.400]   He's taught me how to not be intimidated, which is something
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.960]   that was really hard for me to learn as a person who's just naturally really shy.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.160]   Everybody intimidates me always.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.080]   So what would you do if you were walking in to a room to meet the president?
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.440]   Is there something you would do in advance to prepare?
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.320]   I always do my body language warm up.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.880]   So I always make sure that I drink a lot of water.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.160]   But I always tell myself, OK, keep your shoulders back
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.040]   because the more your shoulders are back, the more you open your chest up,
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.320]   the more you can breathe and the more you show confidence.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.760]   I always remember to keep my hands controlled because that shows
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.920]   that you are controlled.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.240]   So I'll keep my hands either at my belly button or by my waist.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.600]   And I'll sometimes I'll hold my hands together.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.400]   And then the final thing is because you can learn
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.680]   about how anybody feels about you based on where their chin is.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.400]   If someone's chin is down, they're completely terrified by you.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.760]   They're intimidated by you.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.560]   If their chin is up, you find this air of confidence.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.400]   So I'll walk in the room, shoulders back, my chin up, my hands controlled.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.480]   I won't be shaking my body side to side.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.000]   I'll be relatively still.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.200]   I'll look the person in the eye and I won't show any kind of extreme emotion.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.600]   I'm somebody in real life where I'm very enthusiastic.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.000]   But when I meet somebody who I'm intimidated by, I'll tone that down
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.040]   and I won't show that enthusiasm.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.480]   And why that is is because I want them to know that I came there
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.200]   with a serious reason or I came there for a serious type of conversation.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.440]   So I'll really play into that, too.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.840]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:31.200]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes,

[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.040]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.000]   I'm going to take a little bit of a turn.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.480]   I saw on Instagram you applied to be a host on QVC,
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.040]   which is wildly different than everything else you've done,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.320]   other than maybe selling your card game online.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.240]   What's the story behind that?
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.720]   My whole life, people have told me I should be a QVC host.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.720]   And I know this goes against everything I just said about being shy,
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.920]   but I'm also really good when the camera turns on.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.520]   So I've done a lot of TV thanks to Bridesmaid for Hire.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.760]   And when that camera goes on, I'm a different person.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   My mom will say to you, she doesn't recognize me because I completely light up.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.280]   I love TV. I love that spotlight. I love it.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.080]   So my whole life, people have told me that I would do really well on QVC
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.320]   because if I genuinely like something,
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.280]   I am so passionate about it and convincing.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:28.040]   If I genuinely liked this water that I'm drinking,
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.080]   I would bring such passion to it that you would say, you know what, Jen?
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.280]   I'm going to give it a try because you really do seem to adore it.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.640]   I've always been that way. I'm so passionate.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.840]   So my whole life, people have mentioned QVC, mentioned that I should be a host.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.720]   And I was on Instagram one day and I saw this casting director post about it.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.080]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.360]   What will it take for me to try out?
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.160]   Literally five minutes, record a five minute video.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.960]   So I did my hair. I put on some makeup.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.840]   I recorded a five minute video on my camera, on my phone camera.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.400]   And I sent it to them and they liked it.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.640]   I moved to the next round.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   I ended up doing like a zoom live interview with them.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.440]   And that was all it took to try out for QVC.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.320]   Now, ultimately, spoiler alert, I did not get hired,
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.280]   but it was something that I always wanted to try.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.720]   And it took me nothing, five minutes of my life to initially try out.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.280]   Rather than sitting there and thinking about, should I, should I, should I?
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.440]   If I get it, my whole life would have to change.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.120]   I have to move to Pennsylvania.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.680]   I have to do all these things.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:31.360]   I'm the kind of person who has always treated life, business, relationships,
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.440]   anything like this. Don't overthink it.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.120]   Just try. Just start.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.400]   And then after you start, after you have a little bit of skin in the game,
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.360]   then figure out what the heck is going on.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.560]   With Bridesmaid for Hire, I didn't have a business plan.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.720]   I didn't have anything.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.840]   I put the ad out there.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.920]   I figured it out.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.920]   And that's how I am with every single thing I do.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.280]   I do not overthink it.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   I just put it out there and then I figure it out.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   What would you tell someone if you were coaching them who's like,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.640]   I'm not good at that, I'm sitting here overthinking everything?
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.680]   Is there a trick?
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.120]   One thing tomorrow, what's one decision, what's one thing you have to do tomorrow
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.640]   and give yourself five seconds to make a decision and go.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.440]   If you're somebody who is overthinking what color shirt to wear,
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.040]   count one, two, three, four, five, grab something and wear it.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.160]   And then you deal with the consequences of that for the day.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.440]   And if you start to become a person like that, you'll start to realize, OK,
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.880]   I'm not going to overthink decisions.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.680]   I'm going to make one and then deal with the consequences.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.560]   I do this with everything in life.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.360]   And let me tell you, 90% of the things are not successful.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.920]   You haven't heard about them because they haven't taken off. Right.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.200]   But there's occasional thing here and there that ends up working out for you.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.160]   And I think that's how it has to be, how I met my husband.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.320]   I like sharing this story because, again, it was a weird experiment.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.960]   It wasn't something I overthought.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.800]   I was horrible at dating. I was so awkward. I'm so shy.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.080]   I said, you know what, for the whole month of February,
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.000]   you're going to go on 14 dates that month.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.560]   I would go on four dates a day.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.680]   I didn't overthink it.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.280]   Anybody who asked me out, I said, sure, we'll meet. What's the big deal?
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.480]   I didn't overthink it. I became so good at dating.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.960]   I met nobody I wanted to ever see again.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.000]   I go to delete the dating app and he was my final message.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.360]   He was date 15.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.320]   Now I could have overthought that experiment or I could have just said,
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.600]   you know what, I'm going to go on these 14 dates and we'll see what happens.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.040]   So I've tried to really be this kind of person with everything in life.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.840]   And if you're not that kind of person, that's okay.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.960]   You're not going to wake up tomorrow and do something drastic,
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.400]   but try it with a tiny, tiny, tiny, small decision
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.800]   and then see how you feel after.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.600]   I like that.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.720]   Before we wrap, I want to come back to the topic of weddings
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.040]   because we're almost on the other side of this pandemic, right?
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.320]   People have canceled weddings.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.240]   What advice do you have for anyone planning a wedding coming up or maybe
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.120]   better said, what do you think having gone to so many makes a great wedding?
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.880]   There's three things that people care about at your wedding,
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.120]   and they don't care about anything but the three things.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.080]   Number one is the music.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.560]   It doesn't matter if you have a DJ or live music,
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.240]   but you want to have music that gets people up and dancing.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.520]   You really want to make sure that the music is good
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:01.400]   because that makes people have a good time and they'll never, ever forget that.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.440]   You could always remember the weddings
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.520]   where you found yourself smiling and laughing and just having a good time.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.800]   And usually music helps make that happen.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.280]   Number two, people love food.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.400]   So good food will make your wedding phenomenal.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.280]   And here's the thing.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.280]   You don't have to go with a traditional wedding caterer.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.520]   You don't have to have steak and fish and chicken.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.600]   You can have whatever kind of foods you want.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.640]   Make it unique. Make it about you.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.080]   Go to local restaurants, have food trucks, have food there
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.800]   that you genuinely would be excited to eat, because usually that wedding
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.360]   food goes in the trash. You don't even want to eat it.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.800]   And number three is some sort of open bar or alcohol.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.640]   People love their drinks and having that just makes them happy.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.920]   I don't personally care about number three at weddings.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:45.080]   So I'll give you one more thing that really matters is the weather.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.040]   The weather can really affect your wedding.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.760]   So if you're having some sort of outdoor experience or wedding,
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.440]   make sure you always have an indoor rain backup plan
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.920]   because your guests don't want to feel uncomfortable in any sort of way.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.760]   My number one tip for people getting married, and I beg you to listen to me
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   on this, is please do not go into debt with your wedding.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.520]   Yes, it's a big celebration and it's super important,
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.720]   but it is never worth going into debt.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.800]   If you don't have the cash to pay for your wedding, try to plan a wedding
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.720]   where it fits the cash that you have.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.000]   Try not to go into credit card debt or any type of debt for your wedding.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.960]   The best way to do that is to set a budget before you start planning.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.760]   Come up with an overall number for how much you can spend.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.160]   It doesn't matter if it's five thousand fifteen or one hundred thousand.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.680]   Pick the number first and then break down how much you can spend
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.720]   per vendor.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.920]   The best way to figure that out is to pick the top three things
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.120]   you care about for your wedding and then spend the most money there
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.280]   and everything else you'll find budgeted ways to pay for.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.320]   But please, your wedding is special.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.920]   It's important. It is great.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.640]   But you will never meet a couple who says, Yeah, I'm glad I went into a ton of debt
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.440]   and started the marriage off in debt because of the wedding.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.880]   Most people, after they get married, say it was great.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   But if I could do it again, I wouldn't spend that much.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.800]   I'm going to push back on all three music.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.480]   Do you have no, no, no, not not push back.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.240]   But sorry, let me say that again.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.560]   I'm going to drill down on all three and try to get more out of you.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.560]   Music. Do you publish your playlist?
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.560]   I'm sure you've had to be the one that picks the playlist.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:17.080]   Is there a Spotify playlist of what you think makes for a good vibe that you share?
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:20.000]   It's hard because no one ever wants to listen to my music,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.400]   but I would play Kesha and Chainsmokers and I would play hits
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.440]   that if you were in like a Vegas nightclub, you would play right.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.880]   Because you want people to have fun and get up and dance.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.800]   What I think doesn't work well at weddings are the standard playlist.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.880]   Don't play Bruno Mars.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.640]   Don't play Ed Sheeran.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.560]   Don't play these songs that you hear again and again and again.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.320]   Because people are so bored.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:46.000]   We just went to a wedding this weekend and the music was so slow
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.200]   that people were on the dance floor and they were like,
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.520]   wait, what do we do with our bodies to this music?
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.120]   So I know that you want to have like your favorite songs and stuff,
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.560]   but also have things that like put people in good moods.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.440]   And I can tell you all day what to play.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.320]   But of course, pick songs that you also like and you enjoy because it is your wedding.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.880]   But you want to have some good hits as well.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.000]   What about finding something that works with the old people in the room as well?
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.840]   I think, yeah, you want to throw in some songs that they would like.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.360]   But truthfully, they are the kind of people who are so happy to be at your wedding
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.520]   that they're going to dance to Kesha or the Chainsmokers.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.840]   Even if they don't know the song, they're going to have a good time.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.040]   I think we're always like, oh, I got to play some hits
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.800]   that like my great aunt's going to like, but truthfully, your great aunt
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.120]   is going to like anything you play and is going to be so happy to dance.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.960]   We spend so much time and money
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.280]   accommodating everyone that's coming to our wedding.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.360]   But the truth is, we cannot make everybody happy.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.040]   So in general, try to think about how you can make everyone happy as a whole.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   OK, on food, what are some of the most memorable food options you've had?
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.040]   I'll share mine because it was my own wedding, but we decided
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.240]   we didn't want seated, plated meals.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.600]   So we just picked three countries we'd been to where we love the food.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.800]   And then we just served in little paper baskets.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.040]   One was sliders and sweet potato fries.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.520]   One was Thai curry.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.240]   And then we had some sushi rolls.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.640]   We did chocolate chip cookies for dessert because we didn't really care about cake.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:11.880]   So we tried to do small plates that represent countries we'd been to.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.880]   But I'm curious what stood out in a memorable food way.
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.720]   And that's epic because you know what?
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.240]   People are never going to forget that.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.520]   And it meant something to you.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.200]   It was good food.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.520]   Obviously, and we talked about this before.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.040]   I love pizza.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.800]   And I just went to a wedding that was all pizza.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.480]   And not only that, but at the end of the wedding, all of the leftover
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.960]   pizza that nobody ate, they had on a table with to go boxes
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.640]   that you can take home with you.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.080]   I was like, this is the best wedding ever.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.120]   But if you don't like pizza, that's OK.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.640]   But you know exactly what you did, Chris.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.760]   Normal food that people would be excited to eat any other time.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.240]   I think we're also forced to think that we need to have this traditional
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.960]   wedding with all this fancy food.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.760]   But the truth is, most of your guests just want the Thai food
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.760]   or the hamburger sliders or they want slices of pizza
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.600]   or they want macaroni and cheese.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.520]   And especially if it's because it means something to you, they'll be happy as well.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.720]   I love a wedding where the food is different, but also the food
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.600]   is something that means something to the couple.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.480]   And I especially love a wedding where they go heavy on the desserts
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.920]   because I'm a big dessert person personally.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   So I love a good dessert at a wedding that's not wedding cake.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.320]   And then the last this is something we struggled with.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.720]   So for drinks, do you think open bar?
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   Do you think just pick two cocktails?
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.280]   What do you think works best?
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.120]   It's funny because I'm not a drinker at all.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:32.760]   I am like a water seltzer root beer float drinker.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:37.960]   But I know a lot of people at weddings will say this, that if possible,
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.440]   and if this works for your budget and your finances, a type of open bar
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.440]   is usually best.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.560]   And even if that means, by the way, it's open bar for an hour, that's OK.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.200]   But if that is something you can afford, that might be something to lean into
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.480]   because a lot of people do enjoy drinking.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:52.840]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.280]   It doesn't need to be this extravagant open bar.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:59.240]   You can do just a couple of beers or wines or you can do liquor.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.440]   That's not top shelf.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.440]   You can do a signature cocktail and then have like just beer and wine.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.800]   So you don't have to have an extensive open bar.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.760]   But I do think offering alcohol for your guests is something
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.880]   that they do appreciate if they have to pay for it, they will.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.080]   But if that's something you can budget for, I think that's a good gift
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.560]   that a lot of your guests appreciate, which is hard for me to say
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.800]   because I'm not a drinker, but I know a lot of people do care about that.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.520]   And from the perspective of the couple, since you have the inside ear
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.320]   to the bride, usually what is something that someone going to a wedding
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.720]   can do to be a memorable guest in a non embarrassing way?
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.760]   I think going along for the party and being enthusiastic
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.080]   during the ceremony, not having your phone out, recording everything,
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.760]   and instead just making eye contact with the couple or with the officiant.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.240]   And when they walk down the aisle, smiling at them and just being supportive
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.600]   with your body language.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.200]   And during the wedding, most couples who have a dance floor,
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.360]   they really want their guests to be on it.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.080]   So even if you're not a big dancer or you're a little bit shy,
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.960]   just crowding around the dance floor, at least having your conversations
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.760]   on the dance floor.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.640]   A lot of people are so stressed about is this going to be fun?
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   Are people going to dance?
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.680]   So if you can get near the dance floor, you make a lot of people happy.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.680]   Try to also if you can be like a superstar guest,
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.160]   try to be that guest that sits down at their table
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.840]   and makes genuine connections with everybody there.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.920]   Tables at weddings are really awkward.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.640]   You're sitting with people you don't know.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.680]   And if you can be that person that bridges that gap, that relationship,
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.920]   you make the couple happy because then they feel like everyone at their wedding
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.160]   had a good time, met new people, and it wasn't awkward.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.600]   I can't remember the exact person, but I remember after our wedding,
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.680]   there was one person that all of like my aunts and uncles and grandparents
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.840]   were like, "Oh, they were such a great person."
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.160]   It's like, you know, that guest.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.560]   So maybe I'm both saying it was memorable and not because I can't remember
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:51.200]   who it was. Yeah. But be that guest. Be that person. Be that guest.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.560]   I know you help people write a lot of speeches.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.120]   So obviously, if you're stuck, you have a service for it.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.880]   But what advice do you have to someone delivering a speech at a wedding
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.960]   to nail it?
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.440]   Number one, practice public speaking beforehand.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.280]   But really what I mean by that is break down your speech in such a way
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.800]   where every three sentences you are forcing a two second pause.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.400]   So the three, two rule, every three seconds, pause for two seconds.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.800]   That will slow you down.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.280]   That will allow your audience to hear what you're saying,
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.040]   and that will let your jokes land and make them funny.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.280]   Oftentimes, when people are nervous as speakers, they go too fast
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.360]   and nobody can hear what they have to say.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.680]   The best length for a speech is about the three to four minute mark.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.960]   You don't need to go over that.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.560]   If you want to share more, write it down and hand it to the couple to read later.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.640]   But they will really respect a three to four minute speech.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.040]   And when you're writing the speech, remember, you're not writing it
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:43.800]   for the couple.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.800]   This is something that I think people don't realize.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   You're actually writing the speech for the entire wedding.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.080]   So what you're really trying to do is prove the relationship
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.520]   you have with that person who you're good friends with
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.200]   and the person they're marrying to the entire audience.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.120]   So skip out on inside jokes or these long, detailed stories
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.760]   that will take an audience forever to understand and write the speech
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.280]   for the audience who is learning about the relationships that you have.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.800]   That's what makes for such a good speech.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.480]   Anything else I miss advice for anyone going to or planning a wedding?
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.400]   If you're a bridesmaid or a groomsman in a wedding,
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.520]   the only thing I'll tell you is please, please, please understand
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.440]   that you're allowed to say no.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.920]   We often think that if we take on that role, we have to say yes to everything.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.440]   But if there's something you can't afford, you don't want to do
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.520]   or you don't have time for it, make sure you say no.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.880]   How do you say no?
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.520]   You simply say, hey, thanks so much for asking me to do that.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.920]   But at this time, that's just not something that I can swing.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.640]   Happy to help in other ways.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   Keep it easy. Keep it friendly.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.760]   But make sure you stand up for yourself and say no.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.640]   I like it.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:49.640]   Last area I like to ask everyone is to pick a city often where they live,
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.200]   but sometimes your favorite city to visit and tell anyone coming to that city
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.320]   where they should have a meal, grab a drink and something unusual to do.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.320]   I would love for you to come visit us in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.400]   It's a small little neighborhood in Brooklyn right outside of Manhattan.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.680]   When you get here, you're going to get off the subway on Bedford Avenue.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.960]   You're going to walk to Joe's Pizza.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.960]   It's a famous pizza place all over New York.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.640]   You're going to get a slice of cheese pizza and you're going to get it
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.760]   on a paper plate and you are going to walk with that pizza to the East River.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.360]   Once you get to the park down there, you're going to be able to see
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.560]   the Manhattan skyline.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.400]   There's lots of places
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.360]   you can sit and drink and eat right there and have a really, really good time.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.600]   One of the cool parts about this neighborhood is all of the fun vintage
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.040]   shops, but you can shop all day bookstores you can go to.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.400]   And there's tons of music venues.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.520]   There's lots of cities in the world with great music,
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.120]   but there is something so cool about the music in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.080]   I'm proud to live here.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.440]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.400]   This has been great.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.800]   Where can people find everything you're doing online?
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.240]   Because there is a lot.
