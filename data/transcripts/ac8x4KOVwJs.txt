[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.840]   - Well, as many listeners know, Pastor John,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.480]   you have been writing a lot of new books these days,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.960]   which has been great to see.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.660]   It's also a little bit daunting to know what you've written
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.560]   and why you've written particular books.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.960]   So today's question comes from a listener named Derek
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.780]   in Jackson, Mississippi.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.200]   Pastor John, I just received in the mail a copy
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.720]   of your 13 volume collected works,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.080]   and I'm blessed by your ministry
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.520]   and I love having your books all together on my shelf.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.160]   And then of course, I recently purchased your two new books,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.880]   A Peculiar Glory and Reading the Bible Supernaturally.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.280]   I have a lot of reading to do,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.000]   but I would love to hear in a couple of paragraphs
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.120]   how these two new books add to your legacy.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000]   What are the main points you want readers
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   to take from each of them?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.440]   - I'll go Derek one better.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.200]   The two books he's referring to,
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.840]   A Peculiar Glory and Reading the Bible Supernaturally,
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.240]   are really the first two of three, a kind of trilogy.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.340]   And I just finished writing the third,
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.580]   which Lord willing, will be published in the spring of 2018.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.200]   So let me try to give him the big picture of all three,
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.680]   rather than just the first two that he asked about.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.520]   So here I am, 71 years old.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.600]   And when you're 71, in your eighth decade,
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.800]   that always sounds older.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.100]   It's amazing when I think about it.
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.880]   You don't think about your future productivity
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.320]   the same way you did when you were 35.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.040]   You're more keenly aware that you probably won't get to do
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.840]   all you would like to do.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.140]   And the time that remains is unknown.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.080]   It always is unknown, but it feels especially unknown
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.800]   when you're in your eighth decade
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.020]   and you realize you have to make some critical choices
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.240]   and leave out some things, leave some things undone
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.240]   that you might have chosen to do if you could live forever.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.080]   And as I've pondered now my life
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.300]   and what I have done so far and what I would like to do,
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.000]   nothing has seemed more important to me
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.240]   than to focus on the authority and the meaning
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.160]   and the heralding of the Word of God, the Bible.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.660]   And so that's what these three books are about,
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.940]   those three words, authority, meaning, and heralding.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.820]   But before I give in a nutshell what they are,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.100]   let me say why the Bible seems so crucial to me
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.180]   at this juncture in life.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.120]   Everything I've created,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.360]   I'm thinking mainly of the things that I've written,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   is either based on the Bible or built on sand.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.660]   I don't expect any of John Piper's ideas
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.920]   to survive me or be useful when I'm gone
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.780]   if they are not faithful extensions
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.920]   of the meaning of God's Word into life.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.900]   My authority is zero.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.140]   God's authority is everything.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.180]   Whatever I have said that accords with his truth
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.740]   shares in his authority.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.780]   And it might be useful when I'm gone.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.060]   I suppose that's why there's a collected work.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.180]   Somebody thinks so.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.180]   That's the first reason for wanting to focus on the Bible
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.460]   in this last chapter of my life,
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.120]   namely to show why I have written the way I have written,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.980]   basing everything on the Scripture
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.940]   and trying to show that it is based on the Scripture.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.780]   The second reason for this focus
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.740]   is that I realized that the Scriptures are inexhaustible
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.020]   and there's so much more to see in them
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.740]   than I've been able to draw out
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.640]   or than anybody's been able to draw out.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.540]   So I desperately don't want people to substitute my books
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.540]   or my insights for their own inquiry into the Scriptures.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.900]   I really believe this,
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   that there is so much more divine light and truth
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.900]   ready to break forth from God's Word
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.620]   than I have seen or others have seen up until now.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.620]   Therefore, encouraging people to press on
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.980]   with a life devoted to Scripture
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.860]   is vastly more important
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.740]   than hoping that they'll press on with what I've written.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.420]   So that's the second reason.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.300]   Here's the third one for this focus on the Bible
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.500]   here in the last chapter of my life.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.740]   Generations to come until Jesus returns
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.500]   are going to face new crises, new challenges,
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   new issues that I have not faced and others have not faced.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.740]   And therefore, if people depend on what I've written
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.260]   or what others have written,
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.260]   they're gonna be swept away when the challenges come
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.980]   that we never addressed.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.020]   But I have total confidence in the Bible
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.120]   for meeting those future challenges.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.700]   My confidence for the future of the church
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.180]   and for the future of young pastors, for example,
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.540]   or Christians in general,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.540]   is not that they read 20 years from now what I have written.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.660]   That's not my confidence.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.380]   It is the inspired Word of God
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.380]   that equips people for every good work, 2 Timothy 3:17.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.100]   And I think in that text,
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.300]   every good work means that the Bible
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.700]   will be completely sufficient for every new challenge
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.660]   that the church faces until the trumpet sounds
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.200]   and Jesus Christ appears in the clouds.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.180]   The Bible will be sufficient,
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.860]   not the writings of John Piper.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.900]   So those are the reasons that I have put huge focus
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.460]   on the Bible in the last three years of my life.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.900]   The three questions that have driven me
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.040]   in these three books are, one,
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.340]   do we have a Word from God that is true,
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.660]   reliable, authoritative, able to meet all our needs
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.740]   for living a life pleasing to God
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.060]   and good for people and saving our souls?
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.820]   And so I wrote the first book, "A Peculiar Glory,"
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.460]   to give my answer to that question, and my answer is yes.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.820]   And I try to show that you don't need
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.620]   a formal theological training
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.100]   in order to discern with complete confidence
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.460]   that the Bible is the very Word of God.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.680]   And the answer has to do with, as the title says,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.260]   the revelation of the glory of God in Scripture.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.060]   The second book is built on the first
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.660]   and asks the question, if the Bible shows itself
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.980]   to be completely true and reliable and authoritative,
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.540]   a Word from God by virtue of the revelation
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.180]   of the glory of God through it,
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.180]   how then is a person to go about reading this book
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.540]   so as to find God's intended meaning?
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.940]   And the essence of the answer, the essence of the book,
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.860]   is to show the paradoxical intersection
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.060]   of the supernatural dimension of reading
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.060]   and the natural dimension of reading,
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.080]   relying upon the Holy Spirit utterly
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.780]   and relying on our ability to think
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.220]   and construe meaning in clauses and phrases and arguments.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.100]   It's a kind of paradox that the book deals with.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.020]   And then the third book that I just finished
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.220]   raises this question.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.340]   If the Bible is true and authoritative
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.180]   and if you can get meaning from it
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.940]   by reading in a natural, supernatural way,
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.740]   how then is it to be heralded, proclaimed, preached
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.300]   toward the ultimate goal of the universe,
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:03.300]   namely white-hot worship of God's people now and forever?
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.400]   So it's a book on preaching and my proposed title,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.800]   and I don't know what the title will be,
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.740]   my proposed title right now is
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.740]   Expository Exaltation, Text, Reality, and Worship
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.980]   in Preaching Christian Scripture.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.340]   And I would just say one more thing to Derek,
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.140]   and if this sounds like these are only for pastors
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.680]   or preachers, that would be a mistake.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   I hope that he and others will find them useful
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.020]   because everybody should be asking these three questions.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.060]   Can I trust the Bible, book one?
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.260]   How should I go about reading it to get God's meaning,
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.900]   book two, and what should I expect
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.620]   from my church and my pastors
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.140]   when they proclaim this book to me, book three?
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.620]   So my prayer is that when I'm long gone,
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.280]   these three books will not so much preserve
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.620]   John Piper's insights from Scripture,
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.320]   though they are some of that,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.500]   but rather will equip the church to trust the Bible,
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.860]   find their meaning and insight from it,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.460]   and herald the Scriptures for generations to come.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.760]   Man, that's one of our highest priorities at DG,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.900]   making sure Bible readers have the tools
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.140]   and the equipment necessary to make biblical discoveries
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.300]   of God's glory all by themselves.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.420]   Thank you for writing these books, Pastor John,
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.240]   and thank you for your heart to equip
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.820]   a new generation of leaders and preachers
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.420]   to come after you.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.780]   So cool to see.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.100]   Well, this is my chance to let you know
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.060]   that you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.600]   and search our episode archive
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.620]   and even reach us by email with a difficult question
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.740]   that you're facing in life.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.200]   You can do all that through our online home
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.980]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.440]   Well, how can we sinners be spiritually dead
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.340]   and blind to the glory of God
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.620]   and yet also culpable and guilty
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.380]   for not seeing and embracing the glory of God?
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.340]   How do those two facts come together?
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.780]   It's a question that comes out of Pastor John's recent book,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.220]   A Peculiar Glory, and it's on the table on Wednesday.
