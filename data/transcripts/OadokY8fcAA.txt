[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.380]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.100]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.020]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.080]   Today, we are talking about obsessive-compulsive disorder,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.540]   or OCD.
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.520]   We are also going to talk
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.580]   about obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.100]   which, as you will soon learn,
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.060]   is distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.940]   In fact, many people that refer to themselves
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.160]   or others as obsessive or compulsive,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.420]   or quote-unquote having OCD,
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.220]   or OCD about this, or OCD about that,
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.380]   do not have clinically diagnosable OCD.
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.980]   Rather, many people have obsessive-compulsive
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.900]   personality disorder.
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.460]   However, there are many people in the world
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.980]   that have actual OCD.
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.900]   And for those people,
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.620]   there's a tremendous amount of suffering.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.940]   In fact, OCD turns out to be number seven
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.660]   on the list of most debilitating illnesses,
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.060]   not just psychiatric illnesses, but of all illnesses,
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.180]   which is remarkable and somewhat frightening.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.360]   The good news is,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.740]   thanks to the fields of psychiatry,
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.300]   psychology, and science in general,
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.020]   there are now excellent treatments for OCD.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.420]   We're going to talk about those treatments today.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.940]   Those treatments range from behavioral therapies
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.220]   to drug therapies and brain stimulation,
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.860]   and even some of the more holistic or natural therapies.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.220]   As you'll soon learn,
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.260]   for certain people, they may want to focus more
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.860]   on the behavioral therapies,
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.220]   whereas for others, more on the drug-based therapies,
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.880]   and so on and so forth.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.620]   One extremely interesting and important thing
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.100]   I learned from this episode
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.980]   is that the particular sequence
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.940]   that behavioral and/or drug and/or holistic therapies
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.120]   are applied is extremely important.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.660]   In fact, the outcomes of studies
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.180]   often depend on whether or not people
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.940]   start on drug treatment and then follow
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.760]   with cognitive behavioral treatment or vice versa.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.280]   We're going to go into all those details
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.120]   and how they relate to different types of OCD,
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   because it turns out there are indeed different types
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.920]   of obsessions and compulsions,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.060]   and the age of onset for OCD, and so on and so forth.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.300]   What I can assure you is by the end of this episode,
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.140]   you'll have a much greater understanding
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.660]   of what OCD is and what it isn't,
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.720]   and what obsessive compulsive personality disorder is
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.020]   and what it is not,
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.700]   and you'll have a rich array of different therapy options
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.960]   to explore in yourself or in others
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.260]   that are suffering from OCD.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.420]   And if neither you or others that you know suffer from OCD
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.940]   or obsessive compulsive personality disorder,
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.060]   the information covered in today's episode
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.720]   will also provide insight into how the brain
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.900]   and nervous system translate thought into action generally.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.140]   And also, you're going to learn a lot
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.800]   about goal-directed behavior generally.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.300]   My hope is that by the end of the episode,
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.940]   you will both understand a lot about this disease state
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.400]   that we call OCD.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.660]   You will have access to information
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.220]   that will allow you to direct treatments
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.640]   to yourself or others in better ways,
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.820]   and that you will gain greater insight into how you function
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.080]   and how human beings function in general.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.040]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.300]   that we partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.580]   We've done that for several reasons.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.620]   First of all, the quality of their supplements
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.180]   is exceedingly high.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.260]   Second of all, we wanted to have a location
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.860]   where you could find all of the supplements
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.540]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.520]   in one easy-to-find place.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.860]   You can now find that place at livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.220]   In addition, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.060]   something that a lot of other supplement companies
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.340]   simply do not do.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.220]   So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.300]   or you live abroad.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.060]   Right now, not all of the supplements
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.900]   that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.580]   but that catalog of supplements
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.300]   is being expanded very rapidly.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.060]   And a good number of them that we've talked about,
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.460]   some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.700]   and other aspects of mental and physical health
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.540]   are already there.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.400]   Again, you can find them at livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.020]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.800]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.380]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.260]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.740]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.480]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.500]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.380]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.420]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.900]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.620]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.600]   that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.340]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.660]   and I've taken it every day since,
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.140]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.840]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.380]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.620]   once or twice a day
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.380]   is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.220]   In fact, when people ask me,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.060]   "What's the one supplement I should take?"
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.660]   I always say Athletic Greens,
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.300]   because by taking Athletic Greens,
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.940]   you give support to your immune system,
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.160]   to your endocrine system, to your nervous system,
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.420]   and to the so-called gut-brain axis and the gut microbiome.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.900]   As many of you have probably heard,
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.160]   our gut, meaning everywhere from our mouth,
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.640]   down all the way through our intestine,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.340]   is populated by trillions of little microbacteria
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.520]   that support the different systems of our body.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.020]   Athletic Greens has the probiotics
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.340]   that support the microbiome
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.940]   and in turn support things like mood,
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.740]   endocrine function, immune system, and so on.
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.060]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.540]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.820]   and claim their special offer.
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.620]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.420]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.420]   Many people are deficient in vitamin D3,
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.420]   and in general, vitamin D3 and K2
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.540]   support a huge number of factors in your brain and body
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.620]   that support your immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.460]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.940]   to claim their special offer.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.780]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.940]   And frankly, I'm not a big fan of the word nootropics.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.380]   I've said that on various podcasts
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.500]   and on social media posts.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.260]   And the reason I'm not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.060]   is it means smart drugs.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.680]   But as a neuroscientist,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.260]   I know that we don't have circuits in the brain
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.380]   or chemicals in the brain for being smart.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.500]   We have circuits in the brain for focus
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   and for task switching and for creativity.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.900]   And oftentimes those circuits differ from one another,
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.600]   although they collaborate to create things
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.820]   that we think of as intelligence or focus
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.580]   or creativity, et cetera.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.940]   Thesis understands this,
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.440]   and for that reason has developed custom nootropics
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.340]   that are matched to your particular goals
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.740]   and to your particular biology.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.860]   They give you the opportunity to try
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.800]   several different blends over the course of a month
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.520]   and discover which ones work best for you
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.060]   and which ones don't.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.580]   In addition to that personalization,
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.500]   they take it a step further
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.860]   by offering free consultations with a coach
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.380]   to help you optimize your experience
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.780]   and dial in your perfect formulas.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.100]   I've been using Thesis for about eight months now,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.440]   and I can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.220]   are the best that I've ever used.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.520]   My go-to formula is the clarity formula
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.780]   or the motivation formula
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.540]   when I'm going to work or work out,
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.660]   meaning I'm going to do focus cognitive work
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.740]   or I'm going to exercise.
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.420]   I also like their energy formula prior to exercise.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.420]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.580]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.820]   You can take a three-minute quiz
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.580]   that will help match you to the best custom nootropics
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.500]   to start with, and Thesis will send you
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.820]   four different formulas to try in that first month.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.540]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.020]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.720]   to get 10% off your first order.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.180]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.340]   that have cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.860]   I've talked many times on this podcast
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.160]   and on other podcasts and on social media
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.900]   about the critical relationship
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.460]   between temperature and sleep.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.380]   Generally speaking, your body temperature
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.280]   has to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.060]   in order to get into and to stay in deep sleep.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.540]   And waking up has a lot to do with an increase
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.020]   in body temperature of about one to three degrees.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.980]   So for many people like myself who run warm
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.420]   during the night, I find myself waking up
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.460]   in the middle of the night.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.720]   However, recently I started using
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.180]   an Eight Sleep mattress cover.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.180]   And by programming in the specific temperatures
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.020]   that work for me across the night,
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.660]   I'm staying asleep through the whole night.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.380]   And as a consequence, I'm feeling far better during the day,
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.900]   much more focus, alertness, et cetera,
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.220]   all the great things that come
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.100]   from getting excellent sleep consistently.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.540]   The ProPod cover by Eight Sleep
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.260]   is their most advanced solution on the market
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.740]   for thermal regulation during sleep.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.980]   That's the one I use.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.420]   It pairs dynamic cooling and heating
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.520]   with biometric tracking.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.040]   It also has this really nice feature
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.620]   where your mattress basically vibrates a little bit
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.500]   right upon waking.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.820]   I like that as well.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.220]   You can cover any mattress with it.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.820]   You can start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.820]   or as warm as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.300]   And that range is available to you
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.060]   simply because Eight Sleep understands
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.860]   that people have a tremendous range
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.940]   in natural body temperatures and sleeping environments.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.020]   If you want to try Eight Sleep,
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.140]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.700]   Let's talk about OCD or obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.820]   First of all, as the name suggests,
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.660]   OCD includes thoughts or obsessions
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.520]   and compulsions, which are actions.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.420]   The obsessions and the compulsions are often linked.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.760]   In fact, most of the time,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.680]   the obsessions and the compulsions are linked
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.460]   such that the compulsion, the behavior,
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.660]   is designed to relieve the obsession.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.540]   However, one of the hallmark themes
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.560]   of obsessive compulsive disorder
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.140]   is that the obsessions are intrusive.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.900]   People don't want to have them.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.100]   They don't enjoy having them.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.960]   They just seem to pop into people's minds
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.700]   and they seem to pop into their mind recurrently.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.500]   And the compulsions, unlike other sorts of behaviors,
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.600]   provide brief relief to the obsession,
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.840]   but then very quickly reinforce or strengthen the obsession.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.940]   This is a very key theme to realize
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.480]   about obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.000]   So I'm just going to repeat it again.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.640]   These two features, first,
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.920]   the fact that the obsessions are intrusive and recurrent,
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.840]   as well as the fact that the compulsions, the behaviors,
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.720]   provide, if anything, only brief relief for the obsessions,
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.280]   but in most cases simply serve
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.080]   to make the obsession stronger,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.680]   are the hallmark features of obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.120]   And it turns out to be very important
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.480]   to keep these in mind as we go forward,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   not just because they define obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.240]   but they also define the sorts of treatments
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.920]   that will and will not work
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.680]   for obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.240]   And then once you understand a little bit
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.340]   about the neural circuitry
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.100]   underlying obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.000]   which we'll talk about in a few moments,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.760]   then you will clearly understand
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.080]   why being a quote unquote obsessive person
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.400]   or having obsessive compulsive personality
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.680]   is not the same as OCD.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.600]   In fact, we can leap ahead a little bit
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.680]   and compare and contrast OCD
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.120]   with obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.160]   along one very particular set of features.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.120]   Again, I'll go into this in more detail later,
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.840]   but it's fair to say that OCD is characterized
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.480]   by these recurrent and intrusive obsessions.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.440]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.700]   the fact that those obsessions get stronger
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.480]   as a function of people performing certain behaviors.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.560]   So unlike an itch that you feel
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.300]   and then you scratch it and it feels better,
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.920]   OCD is more like an itch that you feel,
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.840]   you scratch it and the itch intensifies.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.460]   That contour or that pattern of behaviors
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.840]   and thoughts interacting is very different
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.300]   than obsessive compulsive personality disorder,
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.020]   which mainly involves a sense of delayed gratification
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.500]   that people want and somewhat enjoy
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.320]   because it allows them to function better
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.840]   or more in line with how they would like
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.280]   to show up in the world.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.380]   So again, OCD has mainly to do with obsessions
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.520]   that are intrusive and recurrent,
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.920]   whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.220]   does not have that intrusive feature to it.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.220]   People do not mind or in fact often invite
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.580]   or like the particular patterns of thought
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.540]   that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.280]   So leaving aside obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.020]   for the moment, let's focus a bit more on OCD
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.820]   and define how it tends to show up in the world.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.120]   First of all, OCD is extremely common.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.500]   In fact, current estimates are that anywhere from 2.5%
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   to as high as three or even 4% of people suffer
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.980]   from true OCD.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.860]   That is an astonishingly high number.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.860]   Now, the reason the range is so big,
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.180]   2.5% all the way up to three or maybe even 4%,
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.700]   is that a lot of the features of OCD go unnoticed,
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.140]   both in the clinician's office
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.840]   and simply because people don't report it
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.300]   and don't talk about it.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.120]   In fact, it is possible to have recurrent
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.600]   and intrusive obsessions and not engage
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.760]   in the sorts of behaviors that would ever allow people
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.280]   to notice that somebody has OCD.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.440]   That can be because some of the intrusive thoughts
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.320]   don't actually lead to overt behaviors like hand-washing
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.260]   or checking that other people would notice.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.700]   It can also be because people learn to disguise
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.300]   or hide their obsessions and their compulsions out of shame
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.620]   or fear of looking strange or whatever it might be,
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.660]   such that they have these obsessive and intrusive thoughts
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.540]   and they do little micro-behaviors,
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.740]   like they might tap their fingers on their fly
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.380]   as a way to avoid, at least in their own mind,
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.140]   something catastrophic happening.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.900]   That might seem crazy to you, it might seem bizarre,
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.060]   but this is the sort of thing
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.420]   that operates in a lot of people.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.940]   And I really want to emphasize this
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.060]   because the clinical literature that are out there
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.020]   really point to the fact that many people have OCD,
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.100]   full-blown OCD, and never report it
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.500]   because of the kind of shame and hiding associated with it.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.260]   Another thing to point out is that OCD
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.720]   is extremely debilitating.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.100]   I mentioned this a few minutes ago,
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.980]   but OCD is currently listed as at number seven
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.580]   in terms of the most debilitating illnesses,
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.980]   not just mental illnesses or disorders,
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.680]   but all types of illnesses,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.500]   including things like asthma and cancer, et cetera.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.300]   So you can imagine with that standing at number seven,
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.620]   that it is both extremely common
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.060]   and extremely debilitating.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.420]   And as a consequence, it's now realized that many hours,
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.540]   days, weeks, months, or even years of work performance
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.920]   or showing up at work, of relational interactions,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.460]   really suffer as a consequence of people having OCD.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.760]   So this is a vital problem that the scientific
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.420]   and psychiatric and psychological communities understand.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.520]   And it's one of the reasons that I'm doing this podcast.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.380]   And of course, I received a ton of interest in OCD
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.140]   because of this incredibly high incidence of OCD
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.940]   and how debilitating it is.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.160]   We could go really deep into why it's so debilitating.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.380]   I don't want to spend too much time on that
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.100]   because I think most of that is pretty obvious,
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.500]   but some of it is not.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.640]   For instance, one of the things that makes OCD
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.780]   so debilitating is of course the shame
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.180]   that we talked about before,
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.980]   but it's also the fact that when people are focusing
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.600]   on their obsessions and their compulsions,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.560]   they're not able to focus on other things.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.960]   That's simply the way that the brain works.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.380]   We're not able to focus on too many things at once.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.580]   The other thing is that OCD takes a lot of time
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.320]   out of people's lives.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.700]   With recurrent intrusive thoughts happening
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.020]   at very high frequency or even at moderate frequency,
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.820]   people are spending a lot of time thinking about this stuff
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.740]   and they're thinking about the behaviors
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.820]   they need to engage in and then engaging in the behaviors,
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.840]   which as I mentioned before,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.440]   just serve to strengthen the compulsions.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.540]   And so they're not actually doing the other things
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.300]   that make us functional human beings,
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.300]   like commuting to work or doing homework or doing work
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.780]   or listening when people are talking or interacting
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.680]   or sports or working out.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.720]   All the things that make for a rich quality life
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.020]   are taken over by OCD in many cases.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.800]   So while that might be obvious to some,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.520]   I'm not sure that it's obvious to everybody
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.500]   just how much time OCD can occupy.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.220]   Another thing you'll soon learn is that sadly,
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.860]   a lot of the obsessions and compulsions in OCD
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.680]   often relate to taboo topics.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.720]   And that's because the general categories of OCD
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.440]   fall into three different bins,
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.820]   checking obsessions and compulsions,
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.220]   repetition obsessions and compulsions
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.380]   and order obsessions and compulsions.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.960]   The checking ones are somewhat obvious,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.260]   checking the stove or checking the locks,
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.680]   which I think we all tend to do.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.440]   I'm somebody typically I'll head off to the car
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.240]   to commute to work and I'll think,
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.540]   I locked the front door and I'll go back once.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.800]   But I won't go back twice or 50 times.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.280]   People with OCD will often go back 20 or 30 times
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.460]   before they'll actually allow themselves to drive off.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.740]   And then it's a real challenge for them
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.320]   to continue to drive off and discard with the idea
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.540]   that they didn't check the stove
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.620]   or they didn't check the locks
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.300]   or they didn't check something else critical.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.660]   Repetition obsessions and compulsions
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.840]   obviously can dovetail with the checking ones,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.000]   but those tend to be things like counting off
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.200]   of a certain number of numbers,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.100]   like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.500]   seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.380]   People will perform that repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.980]   or feel that they have to.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.080]   I remember years ago watching a documentary
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.940]   about the band, the Ramones.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.360]   Most people heard of the Ramones, right?
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.140]   Jeans, t-shirts, aviator glasses.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.720]   Everyone had to change their last name to Ramone.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.460]   They weren't actually all related to one another,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.500]   by the way, you had to change your last name to Ramone.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.360]   The Ramones had one band member who was admittedly
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.420]   and known to others as having OCD.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.040]   And during that documentary, which I forget the name,
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.900]   I think it was called, can't remember.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.100]   Anyway, can't remember, hippocampal lapse there.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.540]   But in this documentary,
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:43.540]   the band members describe Joey Ramone as leaving hotels,
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.640]   walking down the stairs to the parking lot,
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.540]   but then having to walk up and down them seven or eight
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.500]   times and sometimes getting out of the van again
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.620]   and walking up and down them seven or eight times.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.580]   And it always had to be a certain number of times
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.060]   given a certain number of stairs.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.660]   This appears quote unquote crazy.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.980]   But of course, we don't want to think of this as crazy.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.220]   This is somebody who very likely had full blown OCD.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.160]   Now that particular example, believe it or not,
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.820]   is not all that uncommon.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.340]   It just so happens that that example entailed
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.740]   certain compulsions and behaviors that were overt
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.780]   and that other people could see.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.860]   And you can imagine how that would prevent somebody
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.540]   from moving about their daily life easily.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.320]   A lot of people, as I mentioned before,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.740]   have obsessions and compulsions that they hide
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.260]   and they do these little micro-behaviors
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.380]   or they'll just count off in their head
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.600]   as opposed to generating some sort of walking up
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.420]   and down stairs or tapping or things of that sort.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.960]   So we have checking, we have repetition,
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.580]   and then there's order.
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.420]   Order oftentimes is thought of as putting cleanliness
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.120]   or making sure everything is aligned and perfect
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.720]   and orderly.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.360]   And oftentimes that is the case,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.080]   but there are other forms of order that people with OCD
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.680]   can focus on in a obsessive and compulsive way.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.260]   Things like incompleteness,
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.320]   the idea that one can't walk away from something
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.600]   or stop doing something because something's not right
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.540]   or complete in that picture.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.940]   It could be the way the table is set.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.060]   It could be the way that something's written on a page.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.700]   It could be an email.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.640]   Again, now we're still talking about OCD, the disorder.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.680]   We're not talking about
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.840]   obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.160]   I'm aware of, well, I'll just be direct,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.480]   several colleagues of mine, and it's just remarkable,
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.240]   the order in their emails.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.260]   Every email is perfect, punctuated perfect,
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.880]   grammar perfect, everything's spaced perfect.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.800]   Do they have OCD?
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.920]   Well, they might, they might not.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.320]   How would I know unless they disclose that to me?
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.520]   But they might have obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.880]   or they just might be able to generate a lot of order
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.160]   and they have a lot of discipline
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.920]   around the way they write and the way they present
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.640]   any communication with anybody at all.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.840]   So if somebody has a OCD that's in the domain of order,
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.960]   it could be incompleteness and the constant feeling
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.220]   of something not being completed and a need to complete it.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.160]   It can also be in terms of symmetry,
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.680]   that everything be aligned and symmetric in some way.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.880]   This could be seen perhaps in young kids.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.020]   This is one example that I read in the literature
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.540]   of children that need to arrange their stuffed animals
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.540]   in exact same order every day and in a particular order
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.160]   to the point where if you were to move the little stuffed
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.900]   frog over next to the stuffed rabbit,
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.520]   that the child would have an anxiety reaction to that
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.500]   and feel literally compelled, driven to fix that,
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.360]   maybe even multiple times over and over again.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.920]   We'll talk about OCD in children
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.400]   versus adults in a little bit.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.600]   And then the other aspect of order,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.880]   which is a little bit less than intuitive
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.580]   is this notion of disgust.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.440]   This idea that something is contaminated.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.240]   So we often think about OCD and hand-washing behavior
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.200]   in response to people feeling that something is contaminated,
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.260]   a space, a towel, et cetera,
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.460]   or even simply somebody else's hand.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.780]   And so they're unwilling to shake somebody's hand.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.480]   You can imagine how these different bins of obsessions
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.760]   and compulsions, checking repetition and order
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.040]   could be extremely debilitating
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.440]   depending on how severe they are
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.760]   and how many different domains of life they show up in.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.640]   Because oftentimes in movies,
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   and even the way I'm describing it now,
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.360]   it sounds as if, okay, well, somebody has to check the locks,
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.180]   but they don't have to also check the stove.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.880]   Or somebody has the need to count to seven back and forth,
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.060]   up to seven and down to seven,
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.380]   seven times a day or something of that sort.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.180]   Where they need symmetry in very specific domains of life.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.820]   But it turns out that this recurrent
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.200]   and intrusive aspect of obsessions leads people with OCD
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.900]   to have checking repetition
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.420]   and or order compulsions everywhere.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.100]   So whether or not somebody is at work or in school
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.480]   or trying to engage in sport
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.920]   or trying to engage in relationship
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.580]   or just something simple like walking down the street,
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.880]   the obsessions are so intrusive that they show up
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.700]   and they compel people to do things in that domain,
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.120]   independent of whether or not
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.040]   they happen to be in one location or another.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.620]   In other words, the thought patterns and the behaviors
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.220]   take over the environment as opposed to the environment
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.460]   driving the thought patterns and behaviors.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.100]   So it therefore becomes impossible
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.200]   to ever find a room that's clean enough,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.760]   to find a bed that's made well enough,
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.720]   to find anything that's done well enough
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.180]   to remove the obsession.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.080]   And I know I've said it multiple times now,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.020]   but I'm going to say it many times throughout this episode
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.940]   in a somewhat obsessive, but I believe justified way
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.580]   that every time that one engages in the compulsion
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.780]   related to the obsession,
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.920]   the obsession simply becomes stronger.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.320]   So you can imagine what a powerful
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.340]   and debilitating loop that really is.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.740]   So let's drill a little bit deeper
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.460]   into how the obsessions and compulsions
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.860]   relate to one another.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.100]   If we were to draw a line
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.420]   between the obsessions and the compulsions,
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.680]   that line could be described as anxiety.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.840]   Now we need to define what anxiety is.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.900]   And to be quite honest,
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.820]   most of psychology and science
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.980]   can't agree on exactly what anxiety is.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.220]   Typically the way we think about fear
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.020]   is that it's a heightened state of autonomic arousal.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.940]   So increased heart rate, increased breathing,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.240]   sweating, et cetera,
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.940]   in response to an immediate and present threat
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.320]   or perceived threat.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.540]   Whereas anxiety, generally speaking
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.960]   in the scientific literature,
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.700]   relates to the same sorts of thought patterns
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.820]   and somatic bodily responses,
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.540]   heart rate, breathing, et cetera,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.700]   but without a clear and present danger
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.980]   being in the environment or right there.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:23.820]   So that's the way
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.820]   that we're going to talk about anxiety now.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.580]   And anxiety is really what binds the obsessions
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.820]   and compulsions such that
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.660]   someone will have an intrusive thought.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.140]   So for instance, someone will have the thought that
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.900]   if they turn left on any street,
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.780]   that something bad will happen, okay?
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.620]   That's an obsession.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.380]   It's actually not all that uncommon.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.580]   Now, how bad and what the specificity
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.380]   of that bad thing really is will vary.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.380]   Some people will think if I turn left,
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.820]   something generally bad will happen.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.140]   It just makes me feel anxious.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.080]   So they always insist on going right.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.180]   Whereas other people will think if I turn left,
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.180]   so-and-so will die or I will die
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.420]   or something terrible will happen.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.620]   I'll get a disease or someone else will get a disease
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.600]   or I'll be cursing myself or somebody else
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.580]   in some very specific way.
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.820]   This is unfortunately quite common in people with OCD.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.520]   So they have this feeling
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.940]   and the feeling can be generally
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.200]   or specifically related to a particular outcome.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.040]   But beneath that is a feeling of anxiety,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.060]   a quickening of the heartbeat,
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.540]   a quickening of breathing,
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.260]   a narrowing of one's visual focus.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.080]   I've talked about this before on other podcasts,
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.700]   the master stress and other podcasts.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.380]   But if you haven't heard those,
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.740]   let me just briefly describe that
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.580]   when we are in a state of increased
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.180]   so-called autonomic arousal, alertness, stress, et cetera,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.400]   our visual field literally narrows,
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.940]   the aperture of our visual field gets smaller.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.160]   And that's because of the relationship
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.980]   between the autonomic nervous system and your visual system.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.620]   So you start seeing the world
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.620]   through sort of soda straw view
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.060]   or through binocular like view
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.580]   as opposed to seeing the big picture.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.580]   Why is that important?
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.780]   Well, it literally sharpens and narrows your focus
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.780]   toward the very thing that the obsessions
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.040]   and the compulsions are focused on.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.380]   So the person walking down the street
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.200]   who sees the opportunity to go left or right
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.640]   will only see the bad decision.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.500]   Their visual field narrows very tightly
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.180]   along that possibility of taking a left turn.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.620]   And I know as I described, this seems totally irrational,
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.100]   but I want to emphasize
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.420]   that the person with OCD knows it's irrational.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.860]   They might feel crazy because they're having these thoughts,
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.980]   but they know it makes no sense whatsoever
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.820]   that left somehow would be different than right
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.500]   in terms of outcomes in this particular case.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.060]   And yet it feels as if it would.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.460]   In fact, in some cases, it feels as if they went left,
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.820]   they would have a full-blown panic attack.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.980]   So the idea here is that the obsessions and compulsions
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.240]   are bound by anxiety, but then by taking a right-hand turn,
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.400]   again, in this one particular example,
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.880]   by taking a right-hand turn, there's a very brief,
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.660]   I should mention very brief relief of that anxiety
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.700]   at the time of the decision to go right, not left.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.060]   And there's an additional drop in anxiety
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.360]   while one takes the right-hand turn
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.580]   as opposed to the left-hand turn.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.660]   And then, as I alluded to before,
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.300]   there's a reinforcement of the compulsion.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.100]   In other words, by going right,
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.900]   it doesn't create a situation in the brain
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.040]   and psychology of the person that,
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.320]   oh, you know what, I'm not anxious anymore,
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.100]   left would have probably been okay.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.420]   It reinforces the idea that right made me feel better
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.220]   or turning right made me feel better
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.660]   and going left would have been that much worse.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.660]   Again, it reinforces the obsession even further.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:40.200]   And again, we could swap out right turns and left turns
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.860]   with something like hand-washing,
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.140]   the feeling that something is contaminated
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.740]   and the need to wash one's hands,
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.820]   even though one already washed their hands
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.980]   20, 30, 50 times prior.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.600]   And we're actually going to go back to that example
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.620]   a little bit later when we talk about
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.460]   one particular category of therapies
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.620]   that are very effective in many people for OCD,
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.420]   which are the cognitive, behavioral, and exposure therapies.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.840]   'Cause I think some of you have heard
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.920]   of cognitive, behavioral, and exposure therapies,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.060]   but the way they are used to treat OCD
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.980]   is very much different than the way they're used to treat
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.360]   other sorts of anxiety disorders
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.680]   and other sorts of disorders generally.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.180]   So it's fair to say that up to 70% of people with OCD
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.860]   have some sort of anxiety or elevated anxiety,
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.120]   either directly related to the OCD
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.820]   or indirectly related to the OCD.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.460]   And it's really hard to tease those apart
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.640]   because OCD can create its own anxiety.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.700]   As I mentioned before, it can even increase its own anxiety.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.660]   And there's also an issue of depression.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.460]   Having OCD can be very depressing, right?
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.560]   Especially if some of these OCD thoughts and behaviors
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.180]   start to really impede people's ability to function in life,
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.700]   at work, in school, in relationship,
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.780]   they can start feeling less optimistic about life.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.540]   And in fact, some people can become suicidally depressed.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.340]   That's how bad OCD can be for us.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.620]   So we have to be careful when saying
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.540]   that 70% of people with OCD also have anxiety
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.800]   or X number of people with OCD are also depressed
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.140]   because we don't know whether or not
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.700]   the depression led the OCD or the other way around,
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.840]   or whether or not they're operating,
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.800]   as we say in science, in parallel.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.820]   Some of the drug treatments for OCD and depression
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.420]   and anxiety can tease some of that apart.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.600]   And we'll talk about that.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.040]   But I think it's fair to say that what binds the obsessions
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.940]   and compulsions is anxiety,
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.860]   that there's a feeling of it,
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.060]   or I should say an urgent feeling of a need
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.040]   to get rid of the obsession.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.700]   And the person feels as if the only way they can do that
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.380]   is to engage in a particular compulsive behavior.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.680]   Some people are probably wondering
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.260]   if there's a genetic component to OCD.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.940]   And indeed there is,
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.520]   although the nature of it isn't exactly clear.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.620]   And oftentimes when people hear
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.580]   that something has a genetic component,
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.180]   they think it's always directly inherited from a parent.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.620]   And that's not always the case.
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.720]   There can be genes that surface in siblings
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.480]   or genes that surface in children
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.540]   that are not readily apparent
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.020]   in terms of what we call a phenotype.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.300]   So you have a genotype, the gene,
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.420]   and then you have a phenotype,
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.220]   the way it shows up as a body form or like eye color,
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.860]   or how it shows up in terms of a behavior
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.840]   or behavioral pattern.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.780]   Based on twin studies where researchers
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.380]   have examined identical twins, fraternal twins,
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.300]   even identical twins that share the same sac in utero,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.660]   what we call monochorionic.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.220]   So sitting in the same little bag during pregnancy
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.700]   or in different little bags,
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.800]   you can see different levels
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.720]   of what's called genetic concordance.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.380]   But if we were to just sort of cut a broad swath
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.100]   through all of the genetic data,
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.300]   it's fair to say that about 40 to 50% of OCD cases
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.740]   have some genetic component,
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.180]   some mutation or some inherited aspect that's genetic
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.140]   and that one could point to if they got their genome mapped.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.260]   Now, while that's interesting,
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.560]   I don't think it's terribly useful for most people.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.920]   First of all, you can't really control your genes,
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.720]   at least at this point in history,
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.180]   even though there are things like epigenetic control
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.740]   and people are very excited about technologies like CRISPR
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.280]   for modifying the genome.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.600]   In humans at some point,
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.580]   most people can't control their genetics, right?
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.740]   You can't pick who your parents were, as they say.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.120]   So just know that there is a genetic component
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.780]   in about half of people with OCD, but not always.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.260]   Now, as is typical for this podcast,
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.960]   I want to focus on some of the neural mechanisms
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.100]   and chemical systems in the brain and body
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.720]   that generate obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.020]   In fact, if you've watched this podcast before,
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.580]   listened to this podcast before,
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.280]   this is always how I structure things.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.000]   First, we introduce a topic and we explore that topic
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.620]   in detail and really define what it is and what it isn't.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.020]   And then it's very important that we focus on what is known
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.280]   and what is not known about the biological mechanisms
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.300]   that generate whatever that thing happens to be,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.140]   in this case, OCD
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.500]   or obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.940]   Now, I want to emphasize that even if you don't have
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.740]   a background in biology,
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.720]   I will make this information accessible to you.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.820]   And I also want to emphasize that for those of you
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.400]   that are interested in treatments
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.300]   and are anxiously awaiting the description of things
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.860]   that can help with OCD, I encourage you, if you will,
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.320]   to please try and digest some of the material
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.620]   about the underlying mechanisms,
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.700]   because understanding even just a little bit
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.760]   of those biological mechanisms can really help shed light
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.060]   on why particular drug and behavioral treatments
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.080]   and other sorts of treatments work and don't work.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.940]   This is especially important in the case of OCD,
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.560]   where it turns out that the order and type of treatment
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.040]   can really vary according to individual.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.960]   And that's something really special and important about OCD
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.160]   that we really can't say for a number of the other
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.720]   sorts of disorders that we've described
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.320]   on previous podcasts.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.640]   So let's take a step back and look at the neural circuitry.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.760]   What's going on in the brain and body of people with OCD?
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.360]   Why the intrusive recurrent thoughts?
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.360]   Why the compulsions?
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.360]   Why is that whole system bound by anxiety?
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.420]   And in some ways, in thinking about that,
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.840]   I want you to keep in mind that the brain
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.580]   has two main functions.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.560]   The brain's main functions are to take care
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.000]   of all the housekeeping stuff, make sure digestion works,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   make sure the heart beats,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.180]   make sure you keep breathing no matter what,
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.180]   make sure that you can see, you can hear,
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.520]   you can smell, et cetera, the basic stuff.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.320]   And then there's an enormous amount of brain real estate
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.680]   that's designed to allow you to predict
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.920]   what's going to happen next,
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.040]   either in the immediate future or in the long-term future.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.160]   And largely that's done based on your knowledge of the past.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.440]   So you also have memory systems.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.980]   And of course you have systems in the brain and body
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.740]   that are designed to bind what's happening
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.840]   at the housekeeping level, like your heart rate,
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.320]   to your anticipation of what's going to happen next.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.040]   So if you're thinking about something very fearful,
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.620]   your body will have one type of reaction.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.240]   If you're thinking about something very pleasant
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.900]   and relaxing, your body will have another type of reaction.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.880]   So whenever I hear about the brain-body distinction,
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.960]   I have to just remind everybody
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.680]   that there really is no distinction between brain and body
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.420]   when you think about it through the nervous system.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.000]   The nervous system is the brain, the eyes, the spinal cord,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.360]   but of course all their connections
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.520]   with all the organs of the body
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.240]   and the connections of all the organs of the body
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.280]   with the brain, the spinal cord, et cetera.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.840]   So as I describe these neural circuits,
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.840]   I don't want you to think of them
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.720]   as just things happening in the head.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   They are certainly happening in the head.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.660]   In fact, the circuits I'll describe most in detail
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.260]   do exist within the confines of your cranial vault,
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.000]   that's nerd speak for skull,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.160]   but those circuits are driving particular predictions
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.380]   and therefore particular biases
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.440]   towards particular actions in your body.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.980]   They're creating a state of readiness
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.640]   or a state of desire to check or desire to count
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.060]   or desire to avoid, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.420]   So what are these circuits?
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.440]   Well, there's been a lot of wonderful research
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.120]   exploring the neural circuits
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.760]   underlying obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.920]   And that's mainly been accomplished
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.480]   through a couple of methods.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.960]   Most of those methods when applied in humans
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   involve getting some look into which brain areas are active
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.040]   when people are having obsessions
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.740]   and when people are engaging in compulsions.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.360]   Now that might seem simple to do,
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.480]   but of course your brain is housed inside the cranial vault
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.720]   and in order to look inside it,
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.060]   you have to use things like magnetic resonance imaging,
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.480]   which is just fancy technology for looking at blood flow,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.980]   which relates to activation of neurons, nerve cells,
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.000]   or things like PET, P-E-T imaging,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.660]   which has nothing to do with the verb pet
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.560]   and has nothing to do with your house pet,
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.420]   has everything to do with positron emission tomography,
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.120]   which is just another way of seeing
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.480]   which brain areas are active.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.420]   And then you can also use PET to figure out
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.140]   what sorts of neurochemicals are active,
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.180]   like dopamine, et cetera.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.620]   Many studies, we can fairly say dozens,
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.360]   if not hundreds of studies have now identified
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.440]   a particular circuit or loop of brain areas
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.920]   that are interconnected and very active
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.200]   in obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.340]   That loop includes the cortex,
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.880]   which is kind of the outer shell of the human brain,
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.680]   the lumpy stuff, as it sometimes appears
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.160]   if the skull is removed,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.440]   and it involves an area called the striatum,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.180]   which is involved in action selection
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.840]   and holding back action.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.140]   The striatum is involved in what's commonly called
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.420]   go and no-go types of behaviors.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.360]   So every type of behavior,
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.960]   like picking up a pen or a mug of coffee,
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.400]   involves a go type function.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.480]   It involves generating an action.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.080]   But every time I resist an action,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.680]   my nervous system is also doing that
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.840]   using this brain structure, the striatum,
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.040]   which includes, among other things, the basal ganglia.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.160]   We've talked about that before.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.140]   I'm not trying to overload you with terminology here,
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.480]   but I know some people are interested in terminology.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.440]   So you have go behaviors and you have no-go,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.720]   resisting of behaviors, not going toward behavior.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.520]   The cortex and the striatum
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.960]   are in this intricate back and forth talk.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.320]   It's really loops of connections.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.080]   The cortex doesn't tell the striatum what to do.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.060]   The striatum doesn't tell the cortex what to do.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:45.940]   They're in a crosstalk.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.000]   Like any good relationship,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.860]   there's a lot of back and forth communication.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.680]   There's a third element in this corticostriatal loop,
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.040]   as it's called, and that's the thalamus.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.400]   Now, the thalamus is not a structure
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.580]   I've talked a lot about before on this podcast,
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.440]   but it's one of my favorite structures
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.580]   to think about and teach about in neuroanatomy,
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.480]   which I teach back at Stanford
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.440]   and have taught for many years elsewhere,
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.580]   because the thalamus is this incredible egg-like structure
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.340]   in the center of your brain
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.480]   that has different channels through it,
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.380]   channels for relaying visual information
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.520]   or auditory information or touch information
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.920]   from your environment up into your cortex,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.760]   and as a consequence,
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.320]   making certain things that are happening to you
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.480]   and around you apparent to you,
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.560]   making you aware of them,
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.400]   making you perceive them and suppressing others.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.520]   So for instance, right now,
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.120]   if you're hearing me say this,
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.400]   your thalamus has what are called auditory nuclei.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.940]   There's collections of neurons that respond to sound waves
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.960]   that are, of course, coming in through your ears,
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.860]   and your thalamus is active in a way
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.660]   that those particular regions of your thalamus are allowed,
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.960]   literally permitted to pass the information
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.600]   coming from your ears through some other steps,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.580]   but then to your thalamus, your auditory thalamus,
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.600]   then up to your cortex,
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.880]   and you can hear what I'm saying right now.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.840]   At the same time,
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.880]   your thalamus is surrounded by a kind of a shell,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.960]   something called the thalamic reticular nucleus.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.400]   Again, you don't have to remember the names,
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.160]   but this thalamic reticular nucleus
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.720]   also sometimes called the reticular thalamic nucleus.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.240]   This is, believe it or not, a subject of debate in science.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.880]   There are people that literally hated each other,
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.820]   probably still hate each other,
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:22.220]   even though one of them's dead,
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.600]   for decades because they would argue
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.120]   it was the thalamic reticular nucleus,
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.160]   the other was reticular thalamic nucleus.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.560]   Anyway, these are scientists, they're people,
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.000]   they tend to debate.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.340]   But the thalamic reticular nucleus, as I'm going to call it,
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.280]   serves as a sort of gate
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.760]   as to which information is allowed to pass through
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.800]   up to your conscious experience and which is not.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.160]   And that gating mechanism is strongly regulated
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.880]   by the chemical GABA.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.440]   GABA is a neurotransmitter that is inhibitory, as we say.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.680]   It serves to shut down or suppress the activity
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.960]   of other neurons.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.920]   So the thalamic reticular nucleus is really saying no.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.160]   Touch information cannot come in right now.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.820]   You should not be thinking about the contact
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.780]   of the back of your legs
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.560]   with the chair that you're sitting on.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.720]   Andrew, you should be thinking about
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.200]   what you're trying to say and what you're hearing
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   and how your voice sounds
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.880]   and what you see in front of you, et cetera.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.280]   Whereas if I'm about to get an injection from a doctor
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.520]   or I'm in pain or I'm in pleasure,
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.200]   I'm going to think about my somatic sensation
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.440]   at the level of touch.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.120]   And I'm probably going to think less about smells
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.080]   in the room, although I might also think about smells
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.300]   in the room or what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.320]   We can combine all these different sensory modalities,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.040]   but the thalamic reticular nucleus really allows us
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.680]   to funnel, to direct particular categories
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.400]   of sensory experience into our conscious awareness
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.600]   and suppress other categories of sensory experience.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.280]   In addition, the thalamic reticular nucleus
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.540]   plays a critical role in which thoughts are allowed
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.800]   to pass up to our conscious perception
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.680]   and which ones are not.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.360]   So much so that some neuroscientists
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.500]   and indeed some neuro philosophers,
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.640]   if you want to call them that,
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.360]   have theorized or philosophized
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.120]   that the thalamic reticular nucleus
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.320]   is actually involved in our consciousness.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.680]   Now, consciousness is in a topic
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.300]   that I really want to talk about this episode.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.640]   And it's a very kind of mushy, murky,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.120]   as we say in science, it's a schmooey term
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.920]   because it doesn't really have clear definitions.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.640]   So arguments about it often get lost
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.960]   in the fact that people are arguing about different things.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.400]   But when I say consciousness,
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.240]   what I mean is conscious awareness.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.760]   So let's zoom out and take a look at the circuit
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.440]   that we've got and that we now know
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.880]   based on neuroimaging studies is intimately involved
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.720]   in generating obsessions and compulsions in OCD.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.200]   We have a cortex or neocortex,
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.720]   which is involved in perception
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.520]   and understanding of what's happening.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.720]   We have the striatum and basal ganglia,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.400]   which are involved in generating behaviors, go,
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.460]   and suppressing behaviors, no go.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.100]   And we have the thalamus,
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.360]   which collects all of our sensory experience in parallel,
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.540]   hearing, touch, smell, et cetera.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.360]   Not so much smell through the thalamus I should mention,
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.800]   but the other senses that is.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.300]   And then that thalamus is encased
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.300]   by the thalamic reticular nucleus,
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.500]   which serves as a kind of a guard saying,
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.840]   you can pass through and you can pass through,
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.040]   but you, you, you can't pass through
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.240]   up to conscious understanding and perception.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.520]   So that loop, this corticostriatal thalamic loop,
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.600]   corticostriatal thalamic loop
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.560]   is the circuit thought to underlie OCD
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.360]   and dysfunction in that circuit
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.260]   is what's thought to underlie OCD.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.920]   Now, again, the circuit exists in all of us
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.220]   and it can operate in healthy ways
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.400]   or it can operate in ways that make us feel unhealthy
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.460]   or even suffer from full blown OCD.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.640]   How do we know that this circuit is involved in OCD?
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.800]   Well, there, we can look to some really interesting studies
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.660]   that involve bringing human subjects into the laboratory
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.980]   and generating their obsessions and compulsions
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.640]   and then imaging their brain using any variety of techniques
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.660]   that we talked about before.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.180]   What would such an experiment look like?
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.600]   Well, in order to do that sort of experiment,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.680]   first of all, you need people who have OCD
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.880]   and of course you need control subjects that don't
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.800]   and you need to be able to reliably evoke the obsessions
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.760]   and the compulsions.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.600]   Now, it turns out this is most easily,
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.000]   or I should say most simply done
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.860]   'cause it can't be easy for the people with OCD,
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.200]   but this is most straightforward.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.280]   That's the word I was looking for.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.640]   Most straightforward when looking at the category
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.320]   of obsessions and compulsions
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.060]   that relate to order and cleanliness.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.500]   So what they do typically is bring subjects
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.380]   into the laboratory who have a obsession
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.880]   about germs and contamination and a compulsion to hand wash.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.640]   And they give these people, believe it or not,
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.800]   a sweaty towel that contains the sweat and the odor
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.440]   and the liquid basically from somebody else's hands.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.680]   In fact, they'll sometimes have someone wipe their own sweat
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.640]   off the back of their neck and put it on the towel
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.720]   and then they'll put it in front of the person,
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.560]   which as you can imagine for someone with OCD
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.960]   is incredibly anxiety provoking
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.040]   and almost always evokes these obsessions
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.360]   about, oh, this is really bad.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.200]   This is really bad.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.360]   I need to clean, I need to clean, I need to clean.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.600]   Now they're doing all this while someone
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.360]   is in a brain scanner or while they're being imaged
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.180]   for positron emission tomography.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.780]   And then they can also look at the patterns of activation
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:18.960]   in the brain while the person is doing hand washing.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.960]   Although sometimes the apparatus associated
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.800]   with these imaging studies
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.300]   make it hard to do a lot of movement.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.320]   They can do these sorts of studies.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.600]   They have done these sorts of studies in many subjects
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.640]   using different variations of what I just described.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.920]   And lo and behold, what lights up,
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.700]   when I say lights up, what sorts of brain regions
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.640]   are more metabolically active, more blood flow,
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.480]   more neural activity?
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.800]   Well, it's this particular corticostriatal thalamic loop.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.700]   In addition to that, some of the drug treatments
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.240]   that are effective in some,
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.440]   and I want to emphasize some individuals
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.320]   at suppressing obsessions and or compulsions,
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.440]   such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.880]   or SSRIs, which we'll talk about in a little bit.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.920]   When people take those drugs,
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.980]   they see not just a suppression
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.420]   of the obsession and compulsion,
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.300]   but also a suppression of these particular neural circuits.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.600]   They become less active.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.760]   Now I want to emphasize and telegraph
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.360]   a little bit of what's coming later.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.000]   These drugs, like SSRIs, do not work for everybody with OCD.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.040]   And as many of you know,
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.480]   they carry other certain problems and side effects
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.060]   for many, but not all individuals.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.240]   But nonetheless, what we have now is an observation
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.680]   that this circuit, the corticostriatal thalamic loop,
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.040]   is active in OCD.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.080]   We have a manipulation that when people take a drug
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.480]   that, at least in those individuals,
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.600]   is effective in suppressing or eliminating
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.800]   the obsessions and compulsions.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.840]   There's less activity in this loop.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.580]   And thanks to some very good animal model studies
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.140]   that, at least at this point in time,
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.060]   you really couldn't do in humans,
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.060]   although soon that may change,
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.320]   we now know in a causal way that the equivalent circuitry,
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.080]   A, exists in other animals, such as mice, such as cats,
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.360]   such as monkeys, and that activation
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.080]   of those particular corticostriatal thalamic circuits
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.780]   in animal models can indeed evoke OCD
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.240]   in an individual that prior to that did not have OCD.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.240]   So I'm just going to briefly describe one study.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.600]   This is a now classic study published
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.640]   in the journal Science,
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.760]   one of the three apex journals in 2013.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.760]   The first author on this paper is Suzanne Amari, A-H-M-A-R-I.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.200]   I will provide a link to this in the show notes
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.160]   as a truly landmark paper done in Renee Hen's lab
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.400]   at Columbia University.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.500]   And the title of the paper is
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.400]   Repeated Corticostriatal Stimulation Generates,
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.240]   that's the key word here,
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.280]   Generates Persistent OCD-Like Behavior.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.160]   What they did is they took mice, mice do mouse things,
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.640]   they move around, they play with toys,
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.560]   they eat, they pee, they mate,
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.820]   they do various things in their cage, but they also groom.
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.440]   Humans groom, animals with fur groom.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.140]   Well, you hope most people groom, some people overgroom,
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.040]   some people undergroom, but most people groom.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.880]   They'll comb their hair, they'll clean, et cetera.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.760]   Those are normal behaviors that humans engage in.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.840]   I'm not aware that mice comb their hair,
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.080]   but mice adjust their hair.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.880]   So they'll kind of pet their hair and they'll do this.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.620]   They'll sometimes even do it to each other.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.680]   We used to have mice in the lab.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.960]   Now we only do human studies,
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.840]   but the mice will groom themselves.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.340]   And typical, what we call wild type mice,
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.580]   not because they're wild, but because they're typical,
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.640]   will groom themselves at a particular frequency,
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.020]   but not to the point where their hair is falling out,
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.000]   not constantly.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.080]   They are grooming some of the time
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.680]   and they're doing other mouse things, other mouse times.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.060]   So in this particular study,
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.000]   what they did is they used some technology,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.560]   which actually was discussed on a previous episode
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.980]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.360]   This is technology that was developed by a psychiatrist
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.280]   and bioengineer by the name of Karl Deisseroth,
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   one of my colleagues at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.240]   This is technology that allows researchers
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.860]   to use the presentation of light
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.740]   to control neural activity in particular brain areas
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.180]   in a very high fidelity way.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.640]   You control the activity in the cortex or the striatum
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.800]   or the thalamus when you want and how you want.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.620]   It's really a beautiful technology.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.980]   In any event, what they did in this study is,
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.300]   or I should say what Susan Amari and colleagues did
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:19.300]   in the study, was to stimulate the corticostriatal circuitry
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.900]   in animals that did not have any OCD-like behavior.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.140]   And when they did that,
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.420]   those animals started grooming incessantly
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.300]   to the point where their hair was falling out
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.400]   or they even, you know,
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.300]   they didn't take the experiments this far, fortunately,
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.840]   but the animals would have a tendency
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.560]   to almost rub themselves raw.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.020]   In the same way that somebody who has a compulsion
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.220]   to hand wash would, sadly, people will hand wash
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.960]   to the point where their hands are actually bleeding
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.580]   and raw, it's really that bad.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.580]   I know that's tough imagery to imagine.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.440]   And you can't even imagine why someone would self-harm
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.280]   in that way.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.580]   But again, that's that incredible anxiety relationship
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.020]   between the compulsion, excuse me,
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.900]   the obsession and the compulsion,
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.580]   and the fact that engaging in the compulsion
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:00.580]   simply strengthens the obsession and therefore the anxiety.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.580]   So that collection of studies, of data,
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.340]   fMRI, PET scanning in humans, the treatment with SSRIs,
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.980]   and these experiments where researchers
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.740]   have actively triggered these particular circuits
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.740]   in animal models that previously did not have
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.020]   too much activity in these circuits,
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:24.620]   and then they observe OCD emerging really point squarely
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.460]   to the fact that the corticosteroidal thalamic loop
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.320]   is likely to be the basis of OCD.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.900]   Now, of course, other circuits could also be involved,
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.460]   but the corticosteroidal thalamic circuit
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.340]   seems to be the main circuit generating OCD-like behavior.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.660]   That's a lot of mechanism.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.560]   Hopefully it was described in a way
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.380]   that you can digest and understand.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.540]   And some of you might be thinking, well, so what?
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.380]   Why does that help me?
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.060]   I mean, I can't reach into my brain and turn off my cortex.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.620]   I can't reach into my brain and turn off my thalamus.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.460]   And indeed, on the one hand, that's true,
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.440]   but as you'll next learn,
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.740]   when thinking about the various behavioral treatments
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.540]   and drug treatments and holistic treatments for OCD,
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.460]   what you'll notice is that each one taps
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.820]   into a different component
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:09.740]   of this corticosteroidal thalamic loop.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.660]   And by understanding that,
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.540]   you can start to see why certain treatments might work
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.280]   at one stage of the illness versus others.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.760]   You will also start to understand
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.360]   why obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.700]   does not have the same sorts of engagements
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.940]   of these neural loops,
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:30.260]   and yet relies on other aspects of brain and body,
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.700]   and therefore responds best to other sorts of treatments.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.380]   Or in some cases,
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.840]   people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.300]   are not even seeking treatment, as I alluded to before.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.140]   The point here is that
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.180]   by understanding the underlying mechanism,
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:45.940]   why certain drugs and behavioral treatments work
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.120]   and don't work will become immediately apparent.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.380]   And in thinking about that, in knowing that,
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.960]   you'll be able to make excellent choices, I believe,
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.160]   in terms of what sorts of treatments you pursue,
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.880]   what sorts of treatments you abandon,
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.720]   and most importantly, the order,
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.000]   the sequence that you pursue and apply those treatments.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.060]   Before we go any further,
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.140]   I'd like to give people a little bit of a window
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.840]   into what a diagnosis for OCD would look like.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.080]   Give you a sense of the sorts of questions
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.020]   that a clinician would ask
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:18.100]   to determine whether or not somebody has OCD or not.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:18.940]   Now, I want to be clear,
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.640]   I'm not going to do this in an exhaustive way.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.560]   I wouldn't want anyone to self-diagnose,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.660]   although I'm hoping that by sharing some of this,
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:26.000]   that some of you might get insight
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.660]   into whether or not you do have obsessions and compulsions
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.260]   that might qualify for OCD and perhaps even to seek out help.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.260]   The most commonly used test of OCD, or for OCD, I should say,
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.940]   is called the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.580]   And this is, you know, scientists love acronyms,
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.900]   as do the military, and it's the Y-box.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:51.320]   The Y dash B-O-C-S, the Y-box.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.680]   So typically, someone will go into the clinic,
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.720]   either because a family member encouraged them to,
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.620]   or because they feel that they're suffering
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.460]   from obsessions and compulsions.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.440]   And before the clinician would proceed
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.980]   with any kind of direct questions,
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.520]   they would very clearly define
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.900]   what obsessions and compulsions are.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.160]   And here I'm actually reading from the Y-box.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.660]   So quote, "Obsessions are unwelcome and distressing ideas,
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.060]   thoughts, images, or impulses
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.440]   that repeatedly enter your mind.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.560]   They may seem to occur against your will.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.820]   They may be repugnant to you.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.500]   You may recognize them as senseless,
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:22.320]   and they may not fit your personality."
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.740]   Then there are compulsions.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.540]   Quote, "Compulsions, on the other hand,
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.660]   are behaviors or acts that you feel driven to perform,
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.900]   although you may recognize them as senseless or excessive.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.880]   At times, you may try to resist doing them,
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.220]   but this may prove difficult.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.700]   You may experience anxiety that does not diminish
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.380]   until the behavior is completed."
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.300]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.280]   in many cases, immediately after the behavior is completed,
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.580]   the anxiety doesn't just return, it indeed can strengthen.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:46.860]   Now, there are a tremendous number of questions
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.700]   on the Y-box.
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.640]   So I'm just going to highlight
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.240]   a few of the general categories.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.740]   Typically, the person will fill out a checklist.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:57.560]   So they will designate whether or not,
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.180]   currently or in the past,
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:02.160]   they have, for instance, aggressive obsessions,
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.180]   fear that one might harm themselves,
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.860]   fear that one might harm others,
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.060]   fear that they'll steal things,
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.880]   fear that they will act on unwanted impulses,
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.020]   currently or in the past or both.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.080]   That's one category.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.820]   The other one are contamination obsessions.
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.500]   So concern with dirt or germs,
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.500]   bothered by sticky substances or residues,
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.560]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.060]   So a bunch of different categories that include,
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.280]   for instance, sexual obsessions,
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.460]   what are called saving obsessions,
[00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.420]   even moral obsessions,
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.860]   excess concern with right or wrong or morality,
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.900]   concerned with sacrilege and blasphemy,
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.780]   obsession with need for symmetry and exactness.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:37.700]   Again, all of these questions being answered
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.980]   as either present in the past or not present in the past,
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.340]   present currently or not present currently.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:47.580]   And then the test generally transitions over
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.820]   to questions about target symptoms.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.020]   They really trying to get people to identify
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.620]   if they have obsessions, what are their exact obsessions?
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.160]   Now, this turns out to be really important
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.140]   because as we talk about some of the therapies
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.860]   that really work,
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.220]   I'll just give away a little bit
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.020]   of why they work best in certain cases
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:06.760]   and why they don't work as well in other cases,
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.360]   it turns out that it becomes very important
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.300]   for the clinician and the patient
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.840]   to not just identify the obsessions
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.460]   and the compulsions generally
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.980]   in a kind of a generic or top contour way,
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.180]   but to really encourage or even force the patient
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.900]   to define very precisely
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:27.480]   what the biggest most catastrophic fear is,
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.720]   what the obsession really relates to.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.380]   That turns out to be very important
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.460]   in disrupting this corticostriatal thalamic loop
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.620]   and getting relief from symptoms one way or the other.
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.080]   So the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, this Y-box,
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.380]   again, is very extensive.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:45.660]   It goes on for dozens of pages actually
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.960]   and has all these different categories,
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.760]   not so much designed to just pinpoint
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.760]   what people obsess about or what they feel compelled to do,
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.860]   but to also try and identify
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.940]   what is the fear that's driving all this, right?
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.140]   In the way that we've set this up thus far,
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.980]   we've been talking about obsessions and compulsions
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.900]   as kind of existing in a vacuum.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.220]   You're obsessed about germs
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.100]   and you're compelled to wash your hands,
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.800]   obsessed about germs, compelled to wash your hands,
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.160]   or obsessed about symmetry,
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.200]   compelled to put right angles on everything,
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.360]   or obsessed about counting and therefore counting, et cetera.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.380]   But beneath that is a cognitive component
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.240]   that is not at all apparent
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.260]   from someone describing their obsession
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.520]   and from someone describing or displaying their compulsion.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:34.280]   The deeper layer to all that is what is the fear exactly
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.780]   if one were to not perform the compulsion?
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.060]   Meaning what is the fear that's driving the obsession?
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:45.340]   So that brings us to a very powerful category of treatments
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:49.420]   that I should say does not work in everybody with OCD,
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.000]   but works in many people with OCD
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.260]   and really speaks to the underlying neural circuitry
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.660]   that generates OCD and how to interrupt it.
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:02.180]   And that is the treatment of cognitive behavioral therapy
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.600]   and in particular exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.400]   So we're going to talk about cognitive behavioral therapy
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.820]   and exposure therapy now, but right at the outset,
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.040]   I want to distinguish the kinds of cognitive behavioral
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.760]   therapy and exposure therapies that are done
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.400]   for obsessive compulsive disorder,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.600]   the sorts of cognitive behavioral therapies that are done
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.020]   for other types of mental challenges and disorders.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:27.480]   Because cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.160]   really has everything to do with identifying
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.940]   the utmost fear.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.080]   In some sense, we can think of fears
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.840]   as kind of along a hierarchy, right?
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.400]   In the example earlier of somebody being afraid
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.840]   to turn left and therefore feeling compelled to turn right,
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.600]   you would want to take that person and really understand
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.440]   what do they fear most about turning left?
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.980]   Now, they might not be aware of it.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.360]   They might not be conscious to what that really is,
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.680]   but if you were to probe them in a clinical setting,
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.060]   you would eventually get to an answer.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.440]   That answer could be at first, I don't know,
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:59.280]   it's just bad.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.200]   I don't know why it's bad, it makes no sense,
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.400]   but it's just bad, I do not want to go left.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.800]   I don't know why, I don't know why.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.040]   But if you were to push that person a little bit
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.280]   in a respectful and kind and caring way
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.120]   aimed at their treatment,
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:11.960]   if you were to push them and say,
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.600]   "Well, what do you mean by bad?"
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.180]   If you turn left, do you think the world would end?
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.800]   They might say, "No, the world's not going to end,
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.940]   but someone is going to die suddenly."
[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:21.920]   I know that sounds crazy,
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.080]   but somebody is going to die suddenly.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.720]   This almost sounds like superstition.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.960]   We'll talk about superstitions later,
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.320]   but indeed it is somewhat superstitious.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.040]   So for instance, you would say, "Who's going to die?"
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.640]   And they'd say, "I don't know."
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.800]   And you'd say, "No, really, who's going to die?"
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.400]   If you think about this, are you going to die?
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.440]   Is so-and-so going to die?
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.660]   And very often, very often,
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:46.400]   what you find is that people will start to reveal
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.200]   the underlying obsession at a level of detail
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.140]   that both to the clinician and to them
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.340]   can be somewhat astonishing,
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.140]   even though they've been living with that detail
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.200]   in their mind for a very long time.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.120]   Now, how could somebody start to reveal detail
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.760]   about something that's existed in their mind
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:04.200]   for a very long time, but not known about it, right?
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.420]   Not been aware of it.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:06.260]   Now, some of you might think,
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.960]   "Oh, it's repressed or something."
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.320]   That's not at all what's happening.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.560]   If you think about the architecture of OCD,
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.440]   typically people will have an obsession
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.120]   and then they'll engage in the compulsion
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.620]   as quickly as they can to relieve that obsession.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:21.560]   So in many ways, the disease itself prevents people
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.500]   from ever getting to the bottom of that trough,
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.680]   ever getting to the point where they really clearly
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.540]   articulate to themselves exactly what it is that they fear.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:34.080]   But it becomes so essential to articulate exactly
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.900]   what it is that they fear
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.800]   for a somewhat counterintuitive reason.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.040]   You might think, "Oh, the moment they realize
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.480]   exactly what they fear, everything lifts.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.360]   The circuit turns off and they just feel better
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.820]   because they realized it."
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.040]   I wish I could tell you that's the case,
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.820]   but it turns out it's the opposite.
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.160]   What the clinician is actually trying to do
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.180]   is get people to feel more anxiety, not less.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:58.280]   What they're trying to get them to do is to short circuit,
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.600]   no pun intended, to intervene in their own neural circuit,
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:06.600]   I should say, with that relief of anxiety, however brief,
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.340]   brought on by engaging in the compulsion
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.680]   related to the obsession.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:14.800]   So whereas typically someone would feel the obsession with,
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.240]   "Oh, I don't want to turn left
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.300]   'cause something bad is going to happen,
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.700]   someone's going to die," and then they turn right,
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.620]   they never get the option or the opportunity
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:26.600]   to really explore what would happen were they to turn left
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.480]   or to not be able to turn right.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.960]   By forcing them down the path of inquiry
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.220]   that leads them to the place
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:37.160]   where they very clearly identify the fear, the anxiety,
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.520]   it raises the anxiety in them,
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.680]   and that's actually what the clinician is after.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.080]   Cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.040]   in the context of OCD most often involves
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:54.880]   trying to get people to tolerate, not relieve their anxiety.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.280]   This is extremely important,
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.580]   and I realize there's variation to this
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:01.600]   depending on the style of cognitive behavioral therapy,
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.920]   the style of exposure therapy,
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.680]   but almost across the board, the goal, again,
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:09.520]   is to get people to feel the anxiety
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.840]   that normally they are able to at least partially relieve,
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.840]   however briefly, by engaging in the compulsion.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.160]   So if we think back to that circuit
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.080]   of corticostriatal thalamic, what's going on here?
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.420]   Where is CBT intervening?
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.340]   What part of the circuit is getting interrupted?
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.180]   Well, as you recall,
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:29.360]   the cortex is involved in conscious perception,
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.580]   the thalamus and that thalamic reticular nucleus
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:36.100]   are involved in the passage of certain types of experience
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.060]   up to our conscious perception, not others,
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:42.420]   and the striatum is involved in this go/no-go type behavior.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:47.220]   When OCD is really expressing itself in its fullness,
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:50.120]   people feel an anxiety around a particular thought,
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:54.600]   and they either have a go, for instance, wash hands,
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.500]   or a no-go, do not turn left type reaction.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:03.560]   By having people progressively in a kind of hierarchical way
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.560]   reveal their precise source of anxiety,
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.760]   their utmost fear in this context,
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.040]   what happens is they feel enormous amounts
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.800]   of autonomic arousal.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.360]   Now, in the context of anxiety treatment
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.640]   or other types of treatments,
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.720]   the goal would be to teach people to dampen,
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.320]   to lessen their anxiety through breathing techniques
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.760]   or through visualization techniques
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.200]   or through self-talk or through social support,
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.920]   any of the number of things that are well known
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:31.360]   to help people self-regulate their own anxiety.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.840]   Here, it's the opposite.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.080]   What they're trying to get the patient to do
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.280]   is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum,
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.120]   but then do the exact opposite
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.800]   of whatever the normal compulsion is.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.280]   So if normally the compulsion is to wash one's hands,
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.640]   then the idea is to suppress hand washing
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.800]   while being in the experience of the utmost anxiety.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.680]   Or in the case of not turning left,
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:55.280]   the person is expected to,
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.240]   or would hopefully be able to actually turn left.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.320]   And as you can imagine,
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.020]   that would evoke tremendous anxiety
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.080]   and yet to tolerate that anxiety.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:06.960]   Now, I want to be very clear.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.920]   This is not the sort of thing you want to do on your own.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.840]   This is not the sort of thing you want to do for a friend.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.400]   This is done by trained licensed psychologists
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.920]   and psychiatrists.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.200]   But nonetheless, it really points to the fact
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.520]   that as a anxiety-related disorder,
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.640]   OCD is distinct from other types of anxiety
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.600]   and anxiety-related disorders,
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.380]   things like PTSD and panic disorder, et cetera,
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:32.920]   because the goal again is to bring the person
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.360]   right up close to the thing that they fear the most
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.620]   and then to interrupt the circuit.
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:42.640]   And now you should be able to know just intuitively,
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.540]   because you understand the mechanisms,
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.240]   that the circuit you're trying to disrupt
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:49.320]   is the pattern of information flow
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.960]   from the thinking part of the brain,
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.000]   the perception part of the brain,
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.200]   which is the cortex, to the striatum, right?
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.520]   The striatum has these neurons which are active
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.960]   that essentially are,
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.800]   I know it sounds a little bit
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.040]   like a discussion about free will,
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.620]   but they're trying to get the person
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.880]   to generate a certain behavior
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.780]   or suppress a certain behavior.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.240]   And as anxiety ramps up,
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.680]   it's sort of a hydraulic pressure to do that very thing
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.600]   that they've done for so long and they suffer from so much.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.020]   We talked about hydraulic pressure
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.760]   in the context of aggression, in the aggression episode.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.760]   This is very similar, right?
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.460]   There's a kind of a, now when I say hydraulic pressure,
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.860]   it's not actual hydraulic pressure.
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.900]   It's the confluence of a lot of different systems.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.580]   It's neurochemical, as we'll soon learn.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.460]   It's hormonal, it's electrical.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.820]   It's a lot of different things operating in parallel.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.420]   So we can't point to one chemical or transmitter.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.380]   What's happening is the person is feeling compelled
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.660]   to act, act, act, to relieve the anxiety.
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.400]   And through a progressive type of exposure, right?
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.000]   You don't throw people in the deep end
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.480]   in this kind of therapy right off the bat.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.180]   You gradually ratchet them toward
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.880]   or move them toward the discussion
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.380]   of exactly what they fear the most,
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.760]   and then eventually move them toward the interruption
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.980]   of the compulsion as they're feeling
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.740]   this extremely elevated anxiety,
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.880]   of course, within the context
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.560]   of a supportive clinical setting.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.260]   But in doing that, what you are teaching people
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.500]   is that the anxiety can exist without the need
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.100]   to engage in the compulsion.
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.860]   Now, some of this might sound to people like,
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.260]   oh, this is a lot of the kind of fancy
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.860]   psychological neuroscience speak
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.360]   around something that's kind of intuitive.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.820]   But I think for most people, this is not intuitive.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.220]   And for people with OCD, there's no really other way
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:29.460]   to put it, the impulse, the compulsion to avoid anxiety
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.740]   is such a powerful driving force
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.020]   that it should now make sense to you
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.740]   as to why being able to tolerate anxiety
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.100]   and really sit with it and do the exact opposite
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.680]   of what you're normally compelled to do
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.460]   is going to be the path to treatment.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.000]   And indeed, CBT has been shown to be enormously effective,
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.820]   again, for a large number of people with OCD,
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.940]   but not all of them.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.340]   And oftentimes, it requires that it also be used
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.180]   in concert with certain drug treatments,
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.220]   which we're going to talk about in a moment.
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.580]   Next, let's talk about some of the really unique features
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.740]   of cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:04.300]   in the context of OCD that you often don't see
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.260]   in the use of CBT, that is cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:12.020]   for other types of psychiatric challenges and disorders.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.380]   The first element is one of staircasing.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.020]   And I already mentioned this before,
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:22.020]   but this gradual and progressive increase in the anxiety
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.500]   that you're trying to evoke from the patient,
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.960]   from the person suffering from OCD.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.060]   That's done in the context of the office or the laboratory,
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.680]   again, by a trained and licensed clinician.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.760]   But then the person leaves, right?
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.180]   They leave the office, they leave the laboratory.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.860]   And a very vital component of CBT and exposure therapy
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.140]   for people with OCD is that they have and perform
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:50.120]   what's called homework, is literally what they call.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.940]   This might be seen in other sorts of treatments,
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:55.280]   but for OCD, homework is extremely important
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.780]   because within the context of a laboratory experiment
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.780]   or the clinic, patients often feel so much support
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.900]   that they can tolerate those heightened levels of anxiety
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.740]   and interrupt their compulsions.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.220]   Whereas when they get home, oftentimes the familiarity
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.160]   of the environment brings them to a place
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.580]   where all of a sudden those obsessions and compulsions
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.160]   start interacting the same way
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.620]   and they have a very hard time suppressing the behaviors.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.700]   Why would that be?
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:20.300]   Well, in neuroscience, we have a phrase,
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.980]   it's called condition place preference
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.640]   and condition place avoidance.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.680]   There's some other phrases too,
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.700]   but basically it all has to do with a simple thing,
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:30.740]   which is when you feel something repeatedly
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.700]   in a given environment or sometimes even once
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.300]   within a given environment, you tend to feel
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.380]   that same thing again when you return to that
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.700]   or similar environments.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.780]   Okay, so condition place blank or condition place,
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.340]   that is simply fancy nerd speak for the fact that
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.340]   when you're in a place and something good happens,
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.040]   you tend to feel good if you return to that place
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.620]   or a place like it, or if something bad happens
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.060]   in a given place, you tend to feel bad
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.860]   when you return to that place or a place like it.
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.260]   I think the most salient example that leaps to mind
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.940]   is unfortunately the category of bad,
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.420]   but I had some friends years ago visit San Francisco.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.500]   There's been an ongoing, it seems like
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.460]   it's been happening forever,
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.140]   but this is really in the last decade of daytime break-ins
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:12.220]   and nighttime break-ins into cars to steal anything
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.600]   from computers to what seems to be like a box of tissues.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.460]   And there are numerous reasons for this.
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.280]   I don't want to get into,
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.700]   it's not the topic of today's podcast,
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.120]   but I will use this as an opportunity to say,
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.960]   if you're visiting anywhere in the Bay Area,
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.100]   do not leave anything in your car
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.900]   because the window will get broken into
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.380]   sometimes in broad daylight.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.460]   Some good friends of mine were visiting the Bay Area
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.920]   and I texted them and said,
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.900]   hey, by the way, when you're headed to dinner, guys,
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.300]   make sure you bring in all your luggage and computers,
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.340]   however inconvenient that might be.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.260]   They wrote back, too late, everything got stolen.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.300]   So some years ago now,
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.620]   I think five, six years ago this happened.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.560]   Sadly, everything got stolen.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.540]   Most of it could be replaced,
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.620]   but some of it was very sentimental to them.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.860]   Every time we talk,
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.280]   every time we consider having a meeting
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.020]   in a particular city, this comes up as I don't want,
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:56.860]   I don't want to be there,
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.300]   I don't like that city anymore, et cetera.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.140]   And of course, San Francisco
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.580]   has some wonderful redeeming features,
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.560]   but it only takes one bad incident in one location
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.820]   to kind of color the whole picture dark, so to speak.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.060]   The brain works that way.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.620]   The brain generalizes.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.320]   It's not a very specific organ.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.620]   Again, it's a prediction machine
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.020]   in addition to other things.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.780]   So in the case of CBT therapy,
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.820]   the reason there's homework is that when people go home,
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.400]   oftentimes that's when they relapse,
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.420]   if you want to call it that,
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.260]   back into their obsessions and compulsions.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.380]   And that location, that conditioned place
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:31.940]   is where it becomes most important
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.860]   to challenge the anxiety and to deal with the anxiety,
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.420]   to not try and suppress the anxiety
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.860]   through compulsions or other means.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:41.700]   And when I say other means, I want to highlight something.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.780]   We'll come up again a little bit later in the podcast
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:47.280]   that substance abuse is very common in people with OCD
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.920]   because of the anxiety component
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.760]   and also because of people's feelings
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.660]   that they just can't escape from the thoughts
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:57.000]   or behavioral patterns that are so characteristic of OCD.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.340]   So alcohol abuse or cannabis abuse
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:04.340]   or other forms of narcotics abuse are very common in OCD.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.920]   Later, we'll talk about whether or not cannabis
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   can or cannot help with OCD.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.340]   But needless to say, suppressing anxiety
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:16.600]   is exactly the wrong direction that one should take
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:21.480]   if the goal is to ultimately relieve or eliminate the OCD.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.240]   So we now have two characteristics of CBT exposure therapy
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.000]   that are extremely important for OCD
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.060]   and somewhat unique to the treatment of OCD.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.660]   And that's the staircasing up towards the really bad fear,
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:34.920]   the really severe and specific articulation
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.320]   and understanding and feeling of how bad things
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.540]   really would be if someone engaged in a particular behavior
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.000]   or avoided a particular behavior.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.920]   Then there's the component of homework
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.420]   given by the clinician for the person to be able
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.540]   to create a broader set of contexts
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.680]   in which they can deal with the anxiety,
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.420]   not engage in the compulsions.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.660]   And then a very unique feature of treatment of OCD
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:00.800]   that you don't see in many other psychiatric disorders
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.140]   are home visits.
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.620]   I find this fascinating.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:06.480]   I think that the field of psychiatry and psychology
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.700]   traditionally doesn't allow for or invite home visits.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:15.020]   But this component of context, location and context
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:19.860]   being so vital to the treatment and relief of OCD
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:23.620]   has inspired many psychiatrists and psychologists
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.080]   to get permission to do home visits
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.700]   where they actually go visit their patients
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.180]   in their native setting, in their home cages, right?
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.760]   They're not mice, but in their home home cages, right?
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.340]   I'm being facetious here, but people,
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:36.100]   mice live in cages, at least in the laboratory,
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.500]   and humans generally live in houses or elsewhere.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.420]   So they visit them in their home
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.580]   in order to see how they're interacting
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:47.700]   and the particular locations that evoke the most anxiety
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.620]   and the least anxiety.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.540]   Some of the, I don't want to call them crutches,
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:53.140]   but some of the tools that people are using
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:56.900]   to confront and deal with the obsessions and compulsions,
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:59.140]   and in particular, to try and identify
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:03.200]   some of the tools and tricks that people are using
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.320]   to try and avoid that heightened anxiety.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.740]   Because once again, and I know I'm repeating myself,
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.140]   but I think this is just so vital and so unique
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:12.460]   about OCD and the treatment of OCD,
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.400]   the critical need for the patient to be able to tolerate
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:20.140]   extremely elevated levels of anxiety is so crucial.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:23.140]   So if people are avoiding certain rooms in the house,
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.940]   or if people are avoiding certain foods
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.640]   or certain locations in the kitchen,
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.500]   the clinician can start to identify that
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.200]   by mere observation.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.140]   And I should mention here that patients are not always aware
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.780]   of how they are interacting with their home environment.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:41.060]   Some of these patterns are so deeply ingrained in people
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.280]   that they don't even realize that they're constantly
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.180]   turning to the left, or they don't even realize
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.700]   that they're only washing their hands
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:47.760]   on one side of the sink.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.980]   And so the clinician, by visiting the home,
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:52.680]   can start to interrogate a bit in a polite way,
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.300]   in a friendly, in a supportive way,
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.600]   as to do you ever think about why you always flip the faucet
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.480]   to the left or flip the faucet to the right, et cetera.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.740]   Now, we all do a lot of things that are habitual.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.060]   We all do things that are somewhat regular from day to day.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:13.080]   In fact, I would invite you to ask yourself,
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:16.480]   do you always put your toothbrush in the same location?
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.360]   Do you always cap the toothbrush before or after you use it?
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.200]   What sorts of things do you do?
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.540]   Do you wipe the little threading on the toothpaste or not?
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.400]   I'm somebody, I confess that I have,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.720]   well, I have about 3,500 pet peeves,
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.420]   but one of my pet peeves is toothpaste
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.500]   kind of on the thread of the toothpaste.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.200]   It really bothers me, I don't know why.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.840]   Almost as much as trying to wipe it off bothers me,
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.160]   which creates a certain challenge.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.700]   And if I talk about this any further,
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.720]   then I think I would qualify
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.420]   for obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.260]   But I have to say,
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.840]   I don't experience a ton of anxiety about it.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.000]   It doesn't govern my life.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.680]   In fact, I realized that right now
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.640]   there are tubes of toothpaste
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.160]   that have toothpaste along the thread
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.400]   everywhere in the world, and it doesn't really bother me.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.800]   I can still sit here
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.560]   and provide some information about OCD to you.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.200]   It's not intrusive, at least not to my awareness.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.920]   So by the home visit,
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.080]   the therapist can really start to explore
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.040]   through direct questioning
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.780]   and can allow the patient to explore
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.420]   through direct questioning of themselves
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.760]   the things that it might be conscious of
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.220]   and the things that they might not be conscious of
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.580]   that would qualify for OCD.
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.220]   So I'd like to just briefly summarize
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.940]   the key elements of cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.340]   and exposure therapy
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.160]   and how they can be combined with drug treatments
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.360]   that are very effective.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.860]   Much of what I'm going to talk about next
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:33.500]   relates to the data and indeed the practice
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.200]   of an incredible research scientist and clinician.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.080]   So this is Helen Blair Simpson,
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.080]   or I should say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson,
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.380]   because she is indeed an MD, medical doctor,
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:46.000]   and a PhD research scientist
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.180]   at Columbia University School of Medicine.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:52.240]   And one of the world's foremost experts,
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.500]   if not the expert,
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.740]   I would put her in a category
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.700]   of maybe just one to three people
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:01.420]   who is most knowledgeable about the mechanisms of OCD,
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.700]   is actively researching OCD in humans,
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.100]   trying to find new treatments,
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.740]   trying to unveil new mechanisms
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.740]   and expand on our current understanding,
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:14.600]   and who also treats OCD quite actively in her own clinic.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.280]   Dr. Simpson gave a beautiful presentation
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.540]   in which she summarized some of the core elements of CBT
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.700]   and exposure therapy
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:26.140]   for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders.
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:29.260]   She describes that the key procedures are exposures,
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.020]   of course, done in person,
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.520]   and with the actual thing
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.400]   that evokes the obsessions and compulsions.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.600]   So this could be the sweaty towel as described earlier,
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.960]   or could be any number of different triggers
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.020]   done with the patient in real time.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:47.060]   So in vivo, as we say.
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:50.220]   And it could also be things that are imaginal,
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.300]   sitting somebody down in a chair in an office and saying,
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.940]   okay, I want you to imagine the thing
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.300]   that triggers the intrusive thought,
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.000]   or let's just focus on the intrusive thought as it arises,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.140]   and then to explore and expose the patient
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.740]   to their obsessions and compulsions that way.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.900]   So it can be real or it can be imaginal.
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:10.240]   And the goal, of course, then is to gradually
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.420]   and progressively increase the level of anxiety,
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:15.340]   but then to intervene in so-called ritual prevention,
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:18.280]   to prevent the person from engaging in the compulsion.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.900]   The goals, again, I'm paraphrasing here,
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.640]   are to, as she states,
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.420]   disconfirm fears and challenge the beliefs about
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.720]   the obsessions and compulsions,
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.560]   to intervene in the thoughts and the behaviors,
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.080]   and to break the habit of ritualizing and avoiding.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.420]   Now, how is this typically done?
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:38.460]   What are the nuts and bolts of this procedure?
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:42.280]   Typically, this is done through two planning sessions
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.120]   with the patient.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.420]   So describing to the patient what will happen
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.760]   and when it will happen and how long it will happen,
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.080]   so they're not just thrown into this out of the blue.
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.680]   And then 15 exposure sessions done twice a week or more.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.080]   So the one thing to really understand
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.480]   about cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.200]   is that it can take some period of time,
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.440]   several or more weeks, as many as 10 or 12 weeks.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.120]   However, as you'll soon learn,
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.880]   many of the drug treatments that are effective
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.720]   in treating OCD, either alone or in combination
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.860]   with behavioral therapies,
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:13.920]   also can take eight, 10, 12 weeks or longer.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.040]   And many of those never work at all.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.720]   So even though 10 to 12 weeks
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.120]   seems like a long period of time,
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.360]   it's actually pretty standard.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.540]   If you'd like to see more complete description
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.580]   of the protocols for cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.680]   and exposure therapy for OCD,
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.680]   I'll provide links to two papers, COSAC and FOA,
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.280]   F-O-A, which is published in 1997,
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.560]   which might seem like a long time ago,
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.480]   but nonetheless, the protocols are still very useful.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.640]   And then the second paper is by that last author,
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.720]   Faux et al. in 2012,
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.900]   and we'll provide links to both of those.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:46.960]   In addition, Dr. Blair Simpson and others have explored
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.360]   what are the best treatments for patients with OCD
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:53.600]   by comparing cognitive behavioral therapy alone,
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.020]   placebo, so essentially no intervention,
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.080]   or something that takes an equivalent amount of time
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:03.040]   but is not thought to be effective in treatment,
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.340]   as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.400]   So what is an SSRI?
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.040]   An SSRI is a drug that prevents the reuptake
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.780]   of serotonin at the synapse.
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.620]   What are synapses?
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.520]   They're the little spaces between neurons
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.520]   where neurons communicate with one another
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.660]   by vomiting little bits of chemical into the space,
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:25.200]   the synapse, and then those chemicals
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.840]   either evoke or suppress the electrical activity
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.680]   of the next neuron across the synapse.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.560]   And in this case, the neurotransmitter,
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.960]   the chemical that we're referring to is serotonin.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.640]   SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.980]   prevent the reuptake of the chemical that's left,
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:45.360]   in this case, the serotonin that's left in the synapse
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.080]   after that, I called it vomiting to be dramatic,
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.120]   but it's not actually a vomiting,
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.640]   the extrusion of the chemical into the synapse.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.760]   And as a consequence, there's more serotonin around
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.680]   to have more of an effect over time,
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.640]   the net effect being more serotonergic transmission,
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   more serotonin overall.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.420]   So not more serotonin being made,
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.840]   more serotonin being available for use.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.640]   That's what an SSRI does.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.420]   So they compared cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs,
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.640]   they also had the placebo group,
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.160]   and they had cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.920]   plus the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.640]   This was a 12-week study done as described before,
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.360]   two times a week over the course of 12 weeks.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.360]   First of all, the most important thing, of course,
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.500]   placebo did nothing.
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:34.500]   It did not relieve the OCD to any significant degree, right?
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.640]   How did they know that?
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.760]   They gave them the Y-box test that we talked about before,
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.500]   the Yale-Brown test with all those questions
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.920]   of which I read a few.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.460]   So the OCD severity that one has to have on the Y-box
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.200]   is measured in terms of an index
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.840]   that goes from here from eight all the way up to 28.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:53.840]   That shouldn't mean anything.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.840]   So the number eight is kind of meaningless here.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.880]   It's in terms of an index
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.420]   that's only meaningful for the Y-box.
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.720]   But if somebody has a threshold of 16 or higher,
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.080]   it means that they're still having
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.400]   somewhat debilitating symptoms
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.120]   or very debilitating symptoms.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.400]   Placebo did not reduce the obsessions or compulsions
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.240]   to any significant degree.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.440]   However, and I think quite excitingly,
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.000]   cognitive behavioral therapy had a dramatic effect
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.280]   in reducing the obsessions and compulsions
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.980]   such that by four weeks,
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.240]   that score that in this case range from eight to 28
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.360]   dropped all the way from 25 down to about 11.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.160]   So it was a huge drop in the severity of the symptoms.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.560]   Now what's really interesting
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.440]   is that when you look at the effects of SSRIs
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.860]   in the treatment of OCD symptoms,
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:44.780]   they had a significant effect
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.000]   in reducing the symptoms of OCD
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.740]   that showed up first at four weeks
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.260]   and then continued to eight weeks.
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:54.400]   In fact, there was a progressive and further reduction
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.080]   in OCD symptoms from the four to eight week period.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.920]   Again, these are the people just taking the SSRI.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.600]   And then it sort of flattened out a little bit
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.060]   such that by 12 weeks,
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.720]   there was still a significant reduction in OCD symptoms
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.980]   for people taking SSRIs as compared to placebo.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:13.220]   But the severity of their symptoms was still much greater
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.540]   than those receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.120]   So at least in this study,
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.620]   and I should tell you which study it is,
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.960]   this is Faux Lebowitz et al. 2005
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.360]   in the American Journal of Psychiatry.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.760]   We'll also provide a link to this
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.020]   so you can peruse the data if you like.
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:28.400]   But at least in this study,
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.320]   cognitive behavioral therapy was the most effective.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.080]   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, less effective.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.680]   So what happens when you combine them?
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.120]   Well, they explored that as well.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.600]   And the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:44.420]   and the SSRIs together did not lead
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.420]   to any further decrease in OCD symptoms.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:51.440]   This points to the idea that cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.780]   is the most effective treatment.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:54.520]   And again, when I say cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.480]   now I'm still referring to cognitive behavioral
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.720]   slash exposure therapy done in the way
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.900]   that I detailed before, twice a week for 12 weeks or more.
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.660]   So all of the data, at least in this study,
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:05.840]   point to the fact that cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.400]   is really effective and the most effective.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.880]   Does it alleviate OCD symptoms for everybody?
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.440]   No. Is it very time consuming?
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:17.680]   Yes. Twice a week for two sessions or more of 15 minutes,
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.740]   sometimes in the office, plus there's homework,
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:22.260]   plus in an ideal case, there's also home visits
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.200]   from the psychiatrist or psychologist.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.500]   That's a lot of investment, a lot of time investment
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.560]   to say nothing of the potential financial investment.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.320]   Now, Dr. Blair Simpson has given some beautiful talks
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.040]   where she describes these data and also emphasizes the fact
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:42.260]   that despite the demonstrated power
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:45.120]   of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of OCD,
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.560]   most people are given drug treatments
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.020]   simply because of the availability of those drug treatments.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.000]   Now, when I say most people, I want to emphasize
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.840]   that I'm referring to most people
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.720]   who actually go seek treatment,
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.780]   because a really important thing to realize
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:58.680]   is that most people with OCD
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.880]   do not actually go seek evidence-based treatment.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.700]   I want to repeat that.
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.540]   Most people with OCD do not seek evidence-based treatment,
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.820]   which is a tragic thing.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:09.540]   One of the motivations for doing this podcast episode
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.100]   is to try and encourage people
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.180]   who think they may have persistent obsessions
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:17.980]   and compulsions to seek treatment, but most people don't
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.620]   for a variety of reasons we spelled out earlier,
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:22.640]   shame, et cetera.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.320]   Of those that do, the first line of attack
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.340]   is typically a prescription, most often an SSRI,
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.340]   although not always just SSRIs,
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:35.420]   because soon we'll talk about the somewhat common use
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.220]   of also prescribing a low dose of a neuroleptic
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.540]   or an antipsychotic, not always, but often.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.740]   So the important thing to understand here
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.540]   is that excellent researchers like Dr. Simpson
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.880]   understand that while there are treatments
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:53.700]   that we could say are best or are ideal based on the data,
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.700]   that doesn't necessarily mean that's what's being deployed
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.640]   most often in the general public.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.680]   As a consequence, Dr. Simpson and others have explored
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.800]   in a very practical way, whether or not it matters
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.820]   if somebody is getting SSRI treatment
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.240]   and is experiencing that reduction in OCD symptoms
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.900]   that as you may recall is more than what they would
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:21.000]   experience with placebo alone, but not as dramatic
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.940]   a reduction in OCD symptoms as they would get
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:25.040]   with cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.500]   And as I mentioned before, there was this exploration
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.320]   of combining drug treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.120]   from the outset, but they also quite impressively explored
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.240]   what happens when people who are already taking SSRIs
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.480]   initiate cognitive behavioral therapy.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.700]   This is a really wonderful thing that they've done this
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:44.800]   because in doing that, first of all, they're acknowledging
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.840]   that there are many people out there who have sought
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.780]   treatment and are getting some relief from those SSRIs,
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:52.540]   but it perhaps is not as much relief as they could get.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:56.300]   And they are actively acknowledging that many people
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.240]   are getting these drug treatments first.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.560]   In fact, most often people are getting
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.200]   these drug treatments first.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.580]   So what happens when you add in cognitive behavioral therapy?
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:06.220]   Well, the good news is when you add cognitive
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:10.800]   behavioral therapy to someone who's already taking SSRIs,
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.200]   that further improves their symptoms.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.880]   Now that's different than the results that I described
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.440]   before from the same laboratory in fact,
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.500]   that if you combine cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.160]   with SSRIs from the outset, there's no additional benefit
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.800]   of SSRI, however, as I just described,
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.000]   if someone is already taking an SSRI
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.340]   and they're experiencing a reduction in their OCD symptoms
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:40.060]   by adding in cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:44.280]   there's a further reduction in the symptoms of OCD.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.120]   It's very important.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.740]   So for those of you that have sought treatment
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:49.700]   and you're taking a SSRI, or if you're thinking
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.060]   about treatment and you're prescribed an SSRI,
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.240]   the ideal scenario really would be to combine
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.420]   the drug treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.780]   or in some cases, maybe cognitive behavioral therapy alone,
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.940]   although that's a decision that you really have to make
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:05.940]   with the close advice and oversight of a licensed physician,
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:08.660]   because of course these are prescription drugs.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:11.380]   And anytime you're going to add or remove a prescription drug
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.300]   or change dosage, you really want to do that
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.580]   in close discussion with and on the advice of your physician.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.680]   I don't just say that to protect me,
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.580]   I say that to protect you,
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.660]   and 'cause it's just the right thing to do.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.860]   So again, cognitive behavioral therapy is extremely powerful.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:25.860]   Drug treatments seem less powerful,
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.320]   though if you're already on a drug treatment,
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.620]   adding cognitive behavioral therapy can really help.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.980]   So I've been talking about SSRIs
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.520]   and described a little bit about how they work
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.780]   at a kind of superficial level
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.540]   of keeping more serotonin in the synapse
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:39.540]   so that more serotonin can be in action
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:42.540]   as opposed to gobbled back up by those neurons.
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.500]   I should just mention what some of the selective serotonin
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.180]   reuptake inhibitors are.
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.580]   So things like clomipramine,
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.700]   which is not entirely selective.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:54.820]   I should say that that one generally falls
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.580]   into a category of less selective,
[01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:01.260]   so it can impair or can enhance
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:04.060]   some of the other neurotransmitter neuromodulator systems
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.820]   like epinephrine, et cetera.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:09.380]   The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are,
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.900]   at least the classic ones are fluoxetine, Prozac,
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:15.560]   fluvoxamine, fluvox, peroxetine, sertraline,
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.620]   citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.880]   There are about six classic SSRIs.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.260]   Some of them like citalopram are used in children
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.840]   and are available in pediatric doses.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.620]   Some like Prozac may or may not be used in children.
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:33.700]   The details of which SSRIs, et cetera,
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:36.140]   is a very extensive literature and discussion.
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:40.280]   And I think it's safe to say that which drugs to use
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.700]   and at which dosage and whether or not to continue,
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.080]   excuse me, the same dosage over time
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.920]   depends a lot on the individual variation
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.460]   that people express and the responses that they have.
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:51.980]   All of these drugs, in fact,
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:54.880]   I think we can say all drugs have side effects.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.540]   The question is how detrimental those side effects are
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.380]   to daily life.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.360]   The SSRIs are well-known to have effects on appetite.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:04.880]   In some cases, they abolish appetite.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.920]   In some cases, they just reduce it a little bit.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.120]   In some cases, they increase appetite,
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.740]   really is highly individual.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.320]   They can have effects on libido.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.680]   For instance, they can reduce sex drive,
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.140]   sometimes in a dose-dependent way,
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.320]   sometimes in a way that's more like a step function
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.080]   where people are fine at say five or 10 milligrams,
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.960]   but then they get to 15 milligrams
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.900]   and there's a cliff for their libido.
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:30.520]   That can happen, it really depends.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.660]   Please don't take those dosages as exact values
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.740]   'cause this is going to depend on what they're being used for
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.580]   depression or anxiety or OCD.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.500]   And it's also going to depend on the drug, et cetera,
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.980]   just throughout those numbers as a way to illustrate
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.860]   what a kind of a step function would look like.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.180]   It's not gradual, it's immediate at a given dose
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:47.660]   is what that means.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.860]   The other thing is that some of these drugs
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.860]   will have transient effects,
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.700]   so side effects that show up and then disappear,
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.620]   or sadly, people will sometimes take these drugs for a while
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.080]   and then side effects will surface later
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.860]   that weren't there previously,
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.020]   depending on life factors and nutrition factors.
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:05.820]   So it's a very complicated landscape overall.
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:06.860]   And that's why it's really important
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.460]   to explore any kind of drug treatment,
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.360]   SSRI or otherwise, really in close communication
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.340]   with a psychiatrist who really understands
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.620]   the pharmacokinetics and has a lot of patient history
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.100]   and experience with them.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.340]   So what I'm about to tell you next
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:20.780]   is most certainly going to come as a big surprise,
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.860]   which is that despite the fact
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:24.900]   that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.660]   can be effective in reducing the symptoms of OCD,
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:31.260]   at least somewhat, and certainly more than placebo,
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.760]   there is very little, if any, evidence
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.820]   that the serotonin system is disrupted in OCD.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.480]   And I have to point out that this is a somewhat
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.260]   consistent theme in the field of psychiatry.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:45.300]   That is, a given drug can be very effective
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.480]   or even partially effective in reducing symptoms
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.860]   or in changing the overall landscape
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.620]   of a psychiatric disorder or illness.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.880]   And yet there is very little, if any, evidence
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.780]   that that particular system is what's causal
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:03.780]   for OCD or anxiety or depression, et cetera.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.420]   This is just the landscape that we're living in
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:07.620]   in terms of our understanding of the brain and psychiatry
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.700]   and the ways of treating brain disorders.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.460]   So as a consequence, there are a huge number
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:15.680]   of academic reviews that clinicians and research scientists
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.300]   have generated and read and share.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:23.060]   One of the more, I think, thorough ones in recent years
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:24.720]   was published in 2021.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:25.660]   I'll provide a link to this.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:29.080]   This is by an excellent, truly excellent researcher
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.240]   from Yale University School of Medicine.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.460]   I should say not just a researcher,
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:34.980]   but a clinician scientist, again, an MD, PhD.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:37.180]   This is Christopher Pittenger.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.260]   And the title of the review is
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:43.260]   "Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies and New Targets in OCD."
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.700]   And again, we'll provide a link to it.
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:49.640]   This is a just gorgeous review describing,
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.420]   as I just told you, that the serotonin system
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:53.340]   isn't really disrupted in OCD,
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:56.000]   and yet SSRIs can be very effective.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.080]   The review goes on to explore even what sorts of receptors
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.800]   for serotonin might be involved,
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:06.620]   if it's in fact the case that serotonin is a culprit
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:10.160]   in the creation of OCD symptoms.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.780]   Talk about the serotonin 2A receptor
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:15.140]   and the serotonin 1A receptor.
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.700]   Why am I mentioning all that detail if, in fact,
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.200]   it's not clear serotonin is involved?
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.780]   Because I'll just tell you right now,
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:24.060]   there is currently a lot of interest in whether or not
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:26.800]   some of the psychedelics, in particular psilocybin,
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.460]   can be effective in the treatment of OCD.
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.540]   Psilocybin has been shown in various clinical trials,
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.020]   in particular the clinical trials done
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:36.880]   at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine by Matthew Johnson
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.720]   and others.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.380]   Matthew is on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.980]   He's been on the Tim Ferriss Podcast.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:42.980]   He's been on the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.320]   He's a world-class researcher on the use of psychedelics
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.460]   for depression and other psychiatric challenges.
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:52.680]   And there, psilocybin treatment has been seen,
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.540]   at least in those trials, to be very effective
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:58.020]   in the treatment of certain kinds of major depression.
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.180]   Currently, the exploration of psilocybin
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:03.720]   for the treatment of OCD has not yielded similar results,
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.420]   although the studies are ongoing.
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:07.500]   Again, has not yielded similar effectiveness,
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.080]   but the studies are ongoing.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.740]   And the serotonin 2A receptor and the serotonin 1A receptors
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:16.420]   are primary targets for the drug psilocybin.
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:17.840]   So I figured there were going to be some questions
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.740]   about whether or not psychedelics help with OCD.
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.000]   Thus far, it's inconclusive.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.440]   If any of you have been part of clinical trials
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:28.540]   or have knowledge or intuition about this relationship,
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.060]   or potential relationship, I should say,
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.700]   between psilocybin or other psychedelics and OCD,
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:33.880]   please put them in the comment section.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.940]   We'd love to hear from you.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:39.800]   One thing I should point out is that even though
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.020]   serotonin has not been directly implicated in OCD,
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.680]   serotonin and the general systems of serotonin,
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.500]   the circuits in the brain that carry serotonin
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.960]   and depend on it, have been shown
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.860]   to impact cognitive flexibility and inflexibility,
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.080]   which are kind of hallmark themes of OCD.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.080]   So in animals that have their serotonin depleted,
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.920]   or in humans that have very low levels of serotonin,
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.820]   you can see evidence of cognitive inflexibility,
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:07.440]   challenges in task switching,
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.040]   challenges in switching the rules
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.780]   by which one performs a game,
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:14.780]   challenges in any kind of cognitive domain switching.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:17.960]   And so that does indirectly implicate serotonin
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.060]   in some of the aspects of OCD.
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:21.760]   Again, when one starts to explore
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.200]   the different transmitter systems that have been explored
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:27.780]   in animal models and in humans, it's a vast, vast landscape,
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:32.100]   but serotonergic drugs do seem to be the most effective drugs
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:34.740]   in treating OCD, despite the fact, again,
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.200]   despite the fact that there's no direct evidence
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:42.080]   that serotonin systems are the problem in OCD.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:45.160]   If you recall the corticostriatal thalamic loop
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:48.900]   that is so central to the etiology,
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.460]   the presence and the patterns of symptoms in OCD,
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:54.620]   of course, serotonin is impacting that system.
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:57.360]   Serotonin is impacting just about every system in the brain,
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.640]   but there's no evidence that tinkering
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.760]   with serotonin levels specifically in that network
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.480]   is what's leading to the improvements in OCD.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:10.220]   However, if people go into a fMRI scanner
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:11.520]   and those people have OCD
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.360]   and they evoke the obsessions and compulsions,
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:17.400]   you see activity in that corticostriatal thalamic loop.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.880]   Treatments like SSRIs that reduce the symptoms of OCD
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.560]   equate to a situation where there is less activity
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.100]   in that loop.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.200]   And I should point out cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.860]   which we have no reason to believe
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.540]   only taps into the serotonin system.
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:35.460]   I think it would be, extreme strategy would be false,
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:37.440]   actually, to say that cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.600]   taps only into the serotonin system.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.660]   Clearly, it's going to affect a huge number of circuits
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:43.000]   in neurochemical systems.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.620]   Well, people who do cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:47.520]   and find some relief for OCD,
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.040]   they also show reductions
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.780]   in those corticostriatal thalamic loops.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.200]   So basically, we have a situation
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.000]   where we have a behavioral therapy
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.840]   that works in many people, not all,
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.060]   and we have a pretty good understanding
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.080]   of about why it works.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.920]   It increases anxiety tolerance
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:06.920]   and interference with pattern execution,
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.300]   getting people to not engage in the same sorts of behaviors
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:12.140]   that are detrimental to them.
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:14.220]   And we have drug treatments that work,
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:15.180]   at least to some degree,
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:16.460]   but we don't know how they work
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.820]   or where they work in the brain.
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:19.960]   One of the things that really unifies
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:23.360]   the behavioral treatments and the drug treatments
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.400]   is that they take some period of time.
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:28.160]   Some relief from symptoms seems to show up around four weeks
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.840]   and certainly by eight weeks
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:33.180]   for both cognitive behavioral therapy and the SSRIs,
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:36.360]   but it's really at the 10 to 12 week stage
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.000]   when someone's been doing these twice a week
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.940]   cognitive behavioral sessions,
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:43.600]   where they've been taking a SSRI for 10 to 12 weeks,
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:47.640]   that the really significant reduction in OCD symptoms
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.140]   starts to really show up.
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.120]   Now, up until now, I've been talking about the fact
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.960]   that people are getting relief from these treatments.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:57.240]   But sadly, in the case of OCD,
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:00.520]   there is a significant population
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:05.440]   that simply does not respond to CBT or to SSRIs
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:06.560]   or to their combination,
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.520]   which is why psychiatrists also explore the combination
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.440]   of SSRIs and neuroleptics,
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:16.120]   or drugs that tap into the so-called dopamine system
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.400]   or the glutamate system.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.000]   These are other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.780]   that impact different circuits in the brain.
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:23.040]   And just to really remind you
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.120]   what neurotransmitters and neuromodulators do,
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:28.080]   because this is important to contextualize all this,
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.720]   neurotransmitters are typically involved
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:32.800]   in the rapid communication between neurons.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.800]   And the two most common neurotransmitters for that
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.160]   are the neurotransmitter glutamate,
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.560]   which we say is excitatory,
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.080]   meaning when it's released into the synapse,
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:43.600]   it causes the next neuron to be more active or active,
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.800]   and GABA, which is a neurotransmitter that is inhibitory,
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.620]   meaning when it's released into the synapse,
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:50.640]   typically, not always, but typically,
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.040]   that GABA is going to encourage the next neuron
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:56.100]   to be less electrically active or even silence its activity.
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:59.760]   The neuromodulators, by contrast,
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.920]   so not neurotransmitters, but neuromodulators,
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.920]   like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.780]   and acetylcholine, and others,
[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:08.460]   operate a little bit differently.
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:10.560]   They intend to act a little bit more broadly.
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:12.320]   They can act within the synapse,
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.160]   but they can also change the general patterns
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.340]   of activity in the brain,
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:18.800]   making certain circuits more likely to be active
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.400]   and other circuits less likely to be active.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.720]   So when we say dopamine does X or dopamine does Y
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.480]   or serotonin does X or serotonin does Y,
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.080]   they don't really do one thing.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.520]   They change the sort of overall tonality.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.060]   They make it more likely or less likely
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.820]   that certain circuits will be active.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.460]   You can think of them as kind of activating playlists
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:39.500]   or genres of activity in the brain
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.320]   rather than being involved in the specific communication
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:45.100]   or specific songs, if you will, in this analogy,
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:47.380]   or discussions between particular neurons.
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:51.480]   So when we hear that SSRIs increase serotonin
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.400]   and reduce the symptoms of OCD,
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:56.480]   or a neuroleptic reduces the amount of dopamine
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.760]   and makes people feel calmer, for instance,
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:04.760]   or can remove some stereotype repetitive motor behavior,
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.820]   which they can either generate
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.400]   or reduce motor behavior, it turns out.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.800]   So when I say that, what I'm referring to is the fact
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.720]   that these neuromodulators are turning up the volume
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.900]   on certain circuits and turning down the volume
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:18.520]   on other circuits.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.040]   I say that because if you are going to explore
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:25.400]   drug treatments, again, with a licensed physician,
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:28.340]   if you're going to explore drug treatments for OCD,
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:31.760]   and in particular, if you are not getting results
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.400]   from SSRIs or you're not getting results
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.620]   from cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:37.540]   or the side effect profiles of the drugs
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:41.360]   that you're taking for OCD are causing problems
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.080]   that you don't want to take them,
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:44.960]   well, then it's important to understand
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.080]   that anytime you take one of these drugs,
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.780]   they're not acting specifically
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:51.460]   on the corticostriatal thalamic circuit.
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:52.300]   That would be wonderful.
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.280]   That's the future of psychiatry.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.300]   But as now, when you take a drug, it acts systemically.
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.560]   So it's impacting serotonin in your gut.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.760]   It's also impacting serotonin in other areas of the brain.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:06.920]   Hence the effects on things like digestion or libido
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.960]   or any number of different things
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.860]   that serotonin is involved in.
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.400]   Likewise, if you take a neuroleptic,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.360]   like haloperidol or something
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.540]   that reduces dopamine transmission,
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.340]   well, then it's going to have some motor effects
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:21.400]   'cause dopamine is involved in the generation
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.660]   of motor sequences and smooth limb movement.
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:24.760]   That's why people with Parkinson's
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.040]   who don't have much dopamine will get a resting tremor,
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.600]   have a hard time generating smooth movement.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:31.040]   And so the side effects start to make sense
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.600]   given the huge number of different neural circuits
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.960]   that these different neuromodulators are involved in.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.960]   I don't say that to be discouraging.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:40.800]   I say that to encourage patients
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.000]   and careful systematic exploration
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.520]   of different drug treatments for OCD.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:50.480]   Always again, with the careful and close guidance
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:52.040]   and oversight of a psychiatrist
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.680]   because psychiatrists really understand
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.160]   which side effect profiles make it likely
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.480]   that you can or cannot or will never,
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.560]   or maybe someday we'll be able to take a given drug
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.580]   at a given dose.
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.260]   They are the ones that really have that knowledge.
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:07.280]   This is not the sort of thing that you want a cowboy
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.520]   and go try and figure out yourself.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.620]   Now, I also want to acknowledge
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:13.480]   that there are other forms of drug treatments.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.120]   We touched on psilocybin briefly,
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.860]   but there are other forms of drug treatments
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:19.200]   that have been explored for OCD.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.200]   Earlier, we talked a little bit about cannabis.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.640]   Why would cannabis be a place of exploration at all?
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:26.580]   Well, first of all,
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.600]   a number of people try and self-medicate for OCD.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.360]   There is some clinical evidence,
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.680]   I'm not talking about recreational use,
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:33.760]   I'm talking about clinical evidence
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.600]   that cannabis can reduce anxiety.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.800]   Now, earlier we were talking about not reducing anxiety,
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:43.120]   but learning anxiety tolerance in order to deal with
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.120]   and treat OCD in the context of cognitive behavioral
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:47.800]   therapies.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.480]   That doesn't necessarily rule out cannabis
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:52.920]   as a candidate for the treatment of OCD.
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.620]   And in fact, this has been explored.
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:59.200]   A study from Dr. Blair Simpson herself looked at this.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.940]   This was a fairly small scale study.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.240]   So first of all, I'll give you the title,
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.360]   and again, we'll provide a link.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.500]   This is entitled Acute Effects of Cannabinoids
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.600]   on Symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.420]   a human laboratory study.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:12.080]   Very briefly, this was 14 adults with OCD.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.380]   They had prior experience with cannabis.
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:16.540]   This was randomized, placebo controlled.
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.080]   The cannabis was smoked.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.500]   They had different varietals, as they're called.
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:22.400]   They had a placebo.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.780]   So this is basically a condition in which certain subjects
[01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:30.200]   consumed a cigarette that had 0% THC,
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:33.200]   others had 7% THC, other groups that is,
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:37.960]   or some had 0.4% CBD and THC.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.000]   So they looked at CBD.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.320]   I know a lot of people out there interested in CBD.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.640]   There's one of the few studies I could find
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.600]   where they explore different percentages of THC and CBD
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.960]   in these cannabis or marijuana cigarettes, basically.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.900]   The total amount that they consumed,
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:54.640]   I believe was 800 milligrams.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.680]   These again are not suggestions.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.660]   This is just simply reporting what's in this study.
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.460]   You can, again, I'll provide a link.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.720]   They looked at OCD symptoms ratings.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:06.820]   They looked at cardiovascular effects.
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:08.520]   They had a large number of different things
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.460]   that they explored.
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:11.880]   And I should say this study was done in 2020,
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:15.040]   and it was the first placebo controlled investigation
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.040]   of cannabis in adults with obsessive compulsive disorder.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:19.180]   Pretty interesting.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:21.580]   And I'm just reading from their conclusions here.
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:23.280]   The data suggests that smoked cannabis,
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.480]   whether containing primarily THC or CBD,
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.480]   remember they looked at different concentrations of those,
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.280]   has little acute impact,
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.640]   meaning immediate impact on OCD symptoms
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.140]   and yield smaller reductions in anxiety compared to placebo.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:40.400]   So they did not see a, when I say a positive effect,
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.200]   I mean a ameliorative effect,
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.640]   an effect in reducing symptoms of OCD from cannabis or CBD,
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.680]   which, you know, it's unfortunate.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.560]   I think it's unfortunate anytime a treatment doesn't work,
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.840]   but nonetheless, those are the data.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.520]   I'm sure there are going to be other studies.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.680]   I'm sure there are also going to be people
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.880]   in the YouTube comments section
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:01.600]   saying that cannabis and CBD helps their OCD symptoms.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:04.040]   At least I anticipate there probably will.
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.120]   Almost everything I say here,
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.700]   somebody will contradict it with something
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.900]   from their experience, which I encourage, by the way.
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.280]   I want to hear about your experience with certain things,
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:14.360]   even if it's not from randomized placebo controlled studies,
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:15.840]   I still find it very interesting
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.240]   to know what people are doing and what they're experiencing.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.740]   I think that's one of the better uses
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.140]   of social media comment sections
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:22.600]   is to be able to share some of that,
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.220]   not in an advice giving way or prescriptive way,
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.960]   but simply as a way to share
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.040]   and encourage different types of exploration.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.320]   There are other sorts of drug treatments
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.940]   that are gaining popularity for OCD,
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.720]   at least in the research realm.
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:38.180]   One treatment that is a legal, L-E-G-A-L, right?
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:39.160]   Sometimes when I say legal,
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.460]   sometimes people think I say illegal,
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:43.440]   but that is legal, at least by prescription
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.840]   in the United States, is ketamine.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:49.340]   The actions of ketamine are somewhat complex.
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:50.500]   Although we know, for instance,
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.700]   that ketamine acts on the glutamate system,
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:56.400]   it tends to disrupt the transmission
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.480]   or the relationship, I should say,
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.480]   between glutamate, right?
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.080]   Not glutamine, not the amino acid,
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.260]   but glutamate, the neurotransmitter,
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:07.860]   and the so-called NMDA, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor,
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.560]   which is a receptor that's very special
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.400]   in the nervous system,
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.320]   because when glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor,
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.300]   it tends to offer the opportunity
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.140]   for that particular synapse to get stronger,
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:20.580]   so-called neuroplasticity.
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:24.360]   And ketamine is essentially an antagonist,
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.360]   although it works through a complicated mechanism,
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:30.440]   it tends to block that binding of glutamate
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.640]   to the NMDA receptor or the effectiveness of that.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:35.640]   Ketamine therapy is now being used quite extensively
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.520]   for the treatment of trauma and for depression.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.520]   It leads to a dissociative state.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.480]   It's a so-called dissociative analgesic.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.640]   And there are a variety of ways in which that happens.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.920]   We did an episode on depression.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.400]   We're going to do another entire episode
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.840]   all about ketamine,
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.200]   describing the networks that ketamine impacts, et cetera.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:54.020]   Ketamine therapies are being explored for OCD.
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:57.620]   As of now, the data look somewhat promising,
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:00.500]   but there's still a lot more work that needs to be done.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:01.720]   My read of the data
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:05.300]   are that the more extensive clinical trials
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:06.380]   have not happened yet.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:09.260]   The smaller studies that have happened
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.340]   reveal that some patients do get some relief
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:13.480]   from ketamine therapy for OCD,
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.360]   but there was nothing overwhelmingly pointing to the fact
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.520]   that ketamine is a magic bullet for OCD treatment.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.400]   So cannabis CBD, at least now,
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.540]   even though it's one smaller study,
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:30.820]   there's no real evidence that it can alleviate OCD symptoms.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:33.240]   If there are new studies published soon,
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.600]   I'll be sure to update you.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.520]   And if you see those studies, please send them to me.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.880]   Ketamine therapy, the jury is still out.
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.800]   Psilocybin, the jury is still out.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.400]   These are early days.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.400]   Another treatment that's becoming somewhat common,
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.680]   or at least people are commonly excited about
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:49.960]   is transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:52.260]   So this is the use of a magnetic coil.
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:53.880]   This is completely noninvasive,
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.980]   placed on one portion of the skull,
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:01.440]   and one can direct magnetic energy
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.120]   toward particular areas of the brain
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.920]   to either suppress or nowadays,
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.400]   you can also activate particular brain regions.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.480]   There are some interesting data showing that if TMS
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.500]   is applied to areas of the brain
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.960]   involved in the generation of motor action,
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:17.240]   so the so-called motor areas or supplementary motor areas
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:20.720]   as they're called, while people think about
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:23.160]   or have intrusive thoughts,
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.120]   we know that the TMS coil can interrupt the motor behaviors,
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:29.080]   the compulsive behaviors,
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.220]   and at least in a small cohort of studies,
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:35.080]   in a small number of patients within those studies,
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:37.360]   this has been shown to be effective,
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.400]   not just while the coil is on the head, of course,
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.920]   but after the study has been performed
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:43.440]   or the treatment's been performed
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:47.820]   in reducing OCD symptoms by disrupting the tendency
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:51.540]   for the compulsive behavior to be so automatic.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:54.760]   One of the key features of obsessive compulsive disorder
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:58.620]   is that, especially if it's been around for a while,
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:00.320]   the person's been dealing with it for a while,
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.380]   there isn't a pattern in which the person thinks,
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:07.360]   oh, I have this contamination fear, or I need symmetry,
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:09.680]   or I'm kind of obsessed to count to the number seven,
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.860]   and then they pause and they go, ooh, and then they do it.
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:16.240]   No, typically, there's a very close pairing
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.540]   of the obsession and the compulsion in time
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.920]   so that somebody's walking down the street
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.160]   thinking, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.360]   one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven,
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.800]   seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven,
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:27.100]   and they're doing this in such rapid succession
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:29.380]   because the obsessions are coming up so quickly, right?
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:31.640]   Thoughts can be generated very quickly,
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.180]   and then they're generating the compulsions
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:36.640]   as a way to beat down or to try and suppress that anxiety,
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:38.080]   and then it comes right back up again
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.360]   at even stronger, as I described earlier.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.440]   So transcranial magnetic stimulation
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.060]   seems to intervene in these very fast processes.
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:48.260]   Right now, I don't think it's fair to say
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.740]   that TMS is a magic bullet either.
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.440]   I think there's a lot of excitement about TMS,
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.840]   and in particular, I really want to nail this point home.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.480]   In particular, there's excitement about the combination
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:03.760]   of TMS with drug treatments or the combination of TMS
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:05.860]   with cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.440]   and this is a really important point,
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.660]   not just for sake of discussion
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.200]   about obsessive-compulsive disorder,
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.720]   but also depression, ADHD, schizophrenia,
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.720]   any number of different psychiatric challenges
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:21.440]   and disorders in most cases are going to respond best
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.160]   to a combination of behavioral treatment that's ongoing
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.040]   that occurs in the laboratory and clinical setting,
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.700]   but also in the home setting where there's homework,
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:29.900]   maybe even home visits.
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:33.640]   Drug treatments often, not always,
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.260]   are a terrific augment to those cognitive behavioral
[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:38.020]   therapies or other behavioral therapies,
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:40.180]   and then now we are living in the age of
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:41.260]   brain-machine interface.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:43.580]   You have companies like Neuralink that,
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:44.420]   I think it's fair to say,
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:47.660]   are going to enter the brain-machine interface world
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:51.920]   first through the treatment of certain syndromes, right?
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:53.900]   Movement syndromes or psychiatric syndromes,
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:56.120]   probably before they start putting electrodes
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:58.620]   into the brain to stimulate enhanced memory
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:44:59.580]   or enhanced cognition.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.420]   Who knows?
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:01.820]   I don't know exactly what they're doing
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:04.180]   behind the walls of Neuralink, but I have to imagine,
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.760]   in fact, I would wager, maybe not both arms,
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.300]   but I'll wager my left arm,
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:13.300]   that the first set of FDA-approved technologies
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:15.940]   to come out of companies like Neuralink
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.360]   are going to be those for the treatment of things
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.180]   like Parkinson's and movement disorders
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.100]   and cognitive disorders,
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:23.980]   rather than, shall we say, kind of recreational
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:26.060]   cognitive enhancement or things of that sort.
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.500]   So transcranial magnetic stimulation is noninvasive.
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:30.860]   It doesn't involve going down below the skull,
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:31.900]   can have some effect,
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:34.260]   but most laboratories that I'm aware of
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:36.180]   at Stanford and elsewhere
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:38.360]   that are exploring TMS for things like OCD
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:41.420]   and other types of psychiatric challenges
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:44.540]   are using TMS in combination with drug therapies,
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:46.340]   are using, in some cases,
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.280]   for instance, a laboratory at Stanford,
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.180]   hope to get them on the podcast,
[01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:51.760]   a psychiatrist, Nolan Williams,
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.080]   is exploring TMS in combination with psychedelic therapies,
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.340]   not necessarily at the same time,
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.020]   but nonetheless combining them
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:00.480]   or exploring how they impact brain circuitry.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:03.200]   So if you have OCD, should you run out and get TMS
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:04.880]   or should you try ketamine therapy,
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.380]   of course, with a licensed physician?
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:08.460]   I think it's too early to say yes.
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:11.360]   I think the answer is we need to wait and see.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.900]   I think cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:15.080]   the SSRIs and some other drug treatments
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.580]   like neuroleptics combined with SSRIs
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:19.360]   and cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:22.500]   are where the real bulk of the data are.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.120]   I want to make one additional point about cannabis CBD
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.820]   as it relates to obsessive compulsive disorder.
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:30.160]   To me, it's not at all surprising
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.340]   that cannabis CBD did not improve symptoms of OCD
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:38.260]   because in my discussion with Dr. Paul Conte a few weeks ago,
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:40.780]   and as you mentioned, Dr. Conte is indeed a medical doctor,
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:44.240]   a psychiatrist, we were talking about cannabis
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.220]   and its various uses
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:48.220]   because it does have some clinical applications.
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:51.540]   And he mentioned that one of the main effects of cannabis
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:56.540]   is to tighten focus and to enhance concentration on
[01:46:56.540 --> 01:47:00.420]   and thoughts about one particular thing.
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:03.060]   And in some cases that can be clinically beneficial
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:06.100]   and in other cases that can be clinically detrimental.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:11.100]   If you accept the idea that cannabis increases focus
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:15.860]   and you think about OCD and the networks involved
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:18.120]   and you think about the anxiety and the relationship
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.860]   between the obsession and compulsion,
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:22.620]   well then it shouldn't come as any surprise
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:26.100]   that cannabis did not improve the symptoms of OCD
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.980]   because if anything, it would increase focus
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:30.820]   on the obsessions and the compulsions.
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.920]   Now that's not what they observed.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:35.380]   They did not see an exacerbation or a worsening
[01:47:35.380 --> 01:47:37.340]   of the symptoms of OCD with cannabis.
[01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:39.100]   At least that's not my read of the data,
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:41.060]   but they did not see an improvement
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:44.100]   in OCD symptoms with cannabis or CBD.
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:46.060]   And to me, that's not surprising
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:49.540]   given that cannabis CBD seems to increase focus.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:52.020]   Next, I'd like to talk about some of the research on
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.060]   and the roles of hormones in OCD
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:55.900]   because it turns out to be
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:57.840]   a very interesting relationship there.
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:00.260]   But before I do, I want to point out something that
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:02.460]   I realize I probably should have said earlier,
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:05.560]   which is one of the key things for someone with OCD
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.160]   to come to understand if they're going to experience
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.780]   any relief of their symptoms,
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:10.940]   whether or not they're doing drug treatments
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:12.960]   or behavioral treatments or otherwise,
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.960]   is that thoughts are not as bad as actions, right?
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:20.720]   Thoughts are not as bad as actions.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:24.080]   One of the kind of rules that people with OCD
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.120]   seem to adopt for themselves
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.280]   is that thoughts are really truly the equivalent of actions.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.840]   So they'll have an intrusive thought,
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.960]   and we haven't spent too much time on this today,
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.280]   but earlier I touched on the fact that
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.240]   some of the intrusive thoughts that people have in OCD
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.420]   are really disturbing.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:44.080]   They can be really gross or at least gross to that person.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:49.000]   They can evoke imagery that is toxic or infectious
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.840]   or is highly sexualized in a way that is disturbing to them,
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:54.440]   can be very taboo.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:57.160]   This is not uncommon when you start talking to people
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:59.460]   with OCD and you start pulling on the thread.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:02.480]   Again, this would be a psychiatrist who was trained
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.720]   to ask the right questions and gain the comfort
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:05.880]   and trust of a patient.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.680]   They start to reveal that these thoughts
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:09.600]   are really intrusive and kind of disturbing,
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.180]   which is why they feel so compelled
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:13.320]   to try and suppress them with behaviors.
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.240]   One of the powerful elements of treatment for OCD
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.440]   is to really support the patient
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:24.240]   and make them realize that thoughts are just thoughts.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.480]   And that everyone has disturbing thoughts.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.900]   And that oftentimes those disturbing thoughts arise
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:32.060]   at the most inconvenient and sometimes what seems like
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:34.960]   the most inappropriate circumstances.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:37.320]   And this relates to a whole larger discussion
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.740]   that we could have about what are thoughts
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:40.580]   and why do they surface?
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:43.480]   And how come when you stand at the edge of a bridge,
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.160]   even if you do not want to jump off,
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.780]   you think about jumping off.
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:49.400]   And this has to do with the fact that your nervous system
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:52.640]   as a prediction machine is oftentimes testing possibilities.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:55.220]   And sometimes that testing goes way off
[01:49:55.220 --> 01:50:00.220]   into the Netherlands of the thought patterns
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:03.320]   and emotional patterns that we all have inside of us.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.820]   The big difference between a thought and an action
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:09.660]   is that of course the nervous system is one case
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.240]   not translating those patterns of thinking
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:13.980]   into motor sequences.
[01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:18.620]   That nerdy way of saying thoughts aren't actions,
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:20.300]   believe it or not, can be helpful for people
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:23.700]   if they really think about that and use it as an opportunity
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:27.320]   to realize that first of all, they're not crazy.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.280]   They're not thinking and feeling this stuff
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.160]   because they're bad or evil.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:34.160]   And of course, sometimes this can cross over
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:37.380]   with other elements of life where we place moral judgment
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:38.560]   on people for certain behaviors.
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.640]   I think that's part of a healthy society of course,
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.160]   that's where we have laws and punishments
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:45.660]   and rewards for that matter for certain types of behaviors.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:48.220]   But this idea that thoughts are not as bad as actions
[01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:49.740]   and that thoughts can be tolerated
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:52.480]   and the anxiety around thoughts can be tolerated
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.020]   and over time can diminish,
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:56.280]   that's a very powerful hallmark theme
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:57.420]   of the treatment of OCD.
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:59.900]   So I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.860]   Thoughts are not actions.
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:04.500]   Actions can harm us, they can harm other people,
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:08.460]   they can soak up enormous amounts of time.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:10.860]   Thoughts can soak up enormous amounts of time,
[01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:13.140]   they can be very troubling, they can be very detrimental,
[01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:15.780]   we of course want to be sensitive to that.
[01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:18.780]   But when it really comes down to it,
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:22.800]   the first step in treatment for OCD is this realization
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.480]   or the approach to the realization
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.260]   that thoughts are not as bad as actions.
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:29.520]   So what about hormones in OCD?
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:30.700]   Well, this has been explored,
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:33.620]   albeit not as extensively as I would have liked to find,
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.340]   but when I went into the literature,
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:38.220]   I found one particularly interesting study
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.180]   entitled "Neurosteroid Levels in Patients
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:43.100]   with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder" for Sathur Erbe
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:45.500]   and as always, we'll provide a link to the study.
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.520]   The objective of this study was to explore serum
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:53.700]   within blood, neurosteroid levels in people with OCD.
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:54.540]   Why?
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:57.340]   Well, because of the relationship between OCD and anxiety
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:59.640]   and the fact that in stress-related disorders
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:01.220]   such as anxiety and depression,
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:04.100]   the hormones have been extensively explored,
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:06.760]   but not so much in OCD, at least until this study.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:08.260]   So they compared serum levels
[01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:09.720]   of a number of different hormones,
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:14.720]   progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.
[01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:17.260]   This was done in 30 patients with OCD
[01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:19.580]   and 30 healthy controls.
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:20.980]   So it's not a huge study,
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:23.980]   but it's enough to draw some pretty nice conclusions.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:26.880]   These subjects were 18 to 49 years old
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:30.300]   and the controls were age and sex-matched,
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.820]   healthy volunteers, again, no OCD.
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:34.220]   What was the basic takeaway from the study?
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:36.860]   The basic takeaway from the study was that in females
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:39.580]   with OCD, there was evidence
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:43.620]   for significantly elevated cortisol and DHEA.
[01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:46.860]   Now that's interesting because cortisol is well-known
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.540]   to be associated with the stress system,
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:50.660]   although every day, I should mention,
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.980]   we all, male or female,
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:55.740]   everybody experiences an increase in cortisol
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:56.740]   shortly after awakening.
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:59.000]   That's a healthy increase in cortisol.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.120]   Late shifted, I mean late in the day peaks in cortisol,
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:06.540]   where a shift in that cortisol peak to later in the day
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:11.540]   is a known correlate of depression and anxiety disorders.
[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:15.780]   So the fact that cortisol is elevated in DHEA,
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:19.260]   are elevated in female patients with OCD,
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:23.660]   suggests that the cortisol is either reflective of
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:26.780]   or causal for the increase in anxiety.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:28.880]   We don't know the direction of that effect.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:31.660]   Now, in the male patients with OCD,
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:33.800]   there was evidence for increased cortisol,
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:36.980]   again, not surprising given the role of anxiety in cortisol,
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:39.900]   or I should say, given the role of cortisol in anxiety
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:42.840]   and the increasing anxiety seen in OCD,
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:45.940]   but there are also significant reductions in testosterone,
[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:48.140]   which should also not surprise us
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:51.980]   because cortisol and testosterone more or less compete
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:54.940]   in some fashion for their own production.
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:57.900]   Both are derived from the molecule cholesterol,
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:59.620]   and there are certain biochemical pathways
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:01.820]   that can either direct that cholesterol molecule
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:05.180]   toward cortisol synthesis or testosterone synthesis,
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:07.280]   but not both, so they compete.
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:09.460]   So when cortisol goes up in general, not always,
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:12.540]   but in general, testosterone goes down and vice versa.
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:14.300]   If you want to learn more about the relationship
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.780]   between cortisol and testosterone,
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.680]   and there are even some tools
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:20.380]   to try and optimize those ratios in both males and females,
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:21.660]   you can find that in our episode
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:23.680]   on optimizing testosterone and estrogen,
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.760]   that's at Hubermanlab.com.
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:28.940]   Now, I would say the most interesting aspect of this study
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:32.680]   is not that DHEA and cortisol are elevated in females
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:35.640]   with OCD or that cortisol and testosterone
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:36.580]   have this opposite effect,
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:40.080]   cortisol up and testosterone down in males with OCD,
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.020]   but rather the relationship between all of those,
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:48.020]   DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone in terms of GABA.
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:51.540]   GABA, again, being this inhibitory neurotransmitter
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:56.020]   that tends to quiet certain neuronal pathways.
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:58.780]   It does different things at different synapses,
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:01.140]   but in general, the more GABA that's present,
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:02.720]   the more inhibition that's present,
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:05.500]   and therefore the more suppression of neural activity.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:10.500]   And DHEA is known to be a potent antagonist
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:13.420]   of the GABA system, okay?
[01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:18.420]   So here we have elevated DHEA in females,
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:21.060]   and I should also mention that testosterone
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:23.800]   is also known to tap into the GABA system.
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:26.100]   Typically when testosterone is elevated,
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:29.700]   GABA transmission at least is slightly elevated.
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:33.060]   So here we have a situation in which the pattern of hormones
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:37.460]   in females and males with OCD are different
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:40.740]   from those in people without OCD,
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:43.820]   such that GABA transmission is altered
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:47.600]   and the net effect would be an overall reduction in GABA.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:51.340]   Now, GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:53.620]   and broadly speaking is associated
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:55.720]   with lower levels of anxiety,
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:57.700]   and it tends to create balance
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:55:59.420]   within various neural circuits.
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:00.600]   Now that's a very broad statement,
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.500]   but we know for instance in epilepsy
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:04.980]   that GABA levels are reduced,
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:06.960]   and therefore you get runaway excitation
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.320]   of certain circuits in the brain,
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:11.440]   and therefore seizures, either petit mal, mini seizures,
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:14.400]   or grand mal, massive seizures, or even drop seizures
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.780]   where people completely collapse to the floor in seizure.
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:18.360]   You may have seen this before.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.920]   I certainly have, it's very dramatic,
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:22.960]   and it actually is quite debilitating for people
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:23.980]   because obviously they don't know
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:26.200]   when these seizures are coming on most often,
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:28.160]   and then they can fall into a stove
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.880]   or while driving, et cetera.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.160]   So the situation with OCD is one in which,
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:36.360]   for whatever reason, we don't know the direction of effect,
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:39.480]   certain hormones are elevated in females,
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.240]   and certain hormones are elevated in males,
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:45.540]   and those hormones differ between males and females,
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:48.060]   and yet they both funnel into a system
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:51.160]   where GABAergic or GABA transmission in the brain
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:53.400]   is reduced because of this ability
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.180]   for those particular hormones to be antagonists to GABA,
[01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:01.740]   and as a consequence, there's likely to be overall levels
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:05.340]   of increased excitation in certain networks in the brain,
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:07.180]   and that brings us back
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:09.780]   to this corticostriatal thalamic loop,
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:12.340]   this repetitive loop that seems to reinforce,
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:16.520]   or we can say reinforces obsession, leads to anxiety,
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:20.340]   leads to compulsion, leads to transient relief of anxiety,
[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:23.500]   but then increase in anxiety, increased obsession,
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:25.420]   anxiety, compulsion, anxiety, compulsion,
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:27.740]   anxiety, compulsion, and so on and so forth.
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:30.660]   So I have not found studies
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:34.320]   that have explored adjusting testosterone levels
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.060]   through exogenous administration,
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:37.620]   cream or injection or otherwise,
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:42.200]   or that have focused on reducing DHEA in females.
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:43.780]   If anyone is aware of such studies,
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:46.820]   please put them in the comment section on YouTube
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:47.820]   or send them to us.
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:50.620]   We have a contact site on the website at HubermanLab.com,
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.240]   but the comment section on YouTube would be best,
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:56.260]   but because we know that hormones impact neuromodulators
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:58.020]   and neurotransmitters, as I just described,
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:00.080]   and that those neuromodulators and neurotransmitters
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.200]   play an intimate role in the generation
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:05.280]   and the treatment of things like OCD,
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:08.320]   it stands to reason that manipulations
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:11.600]   of those hormone systems, however subtle or dramatic,
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:14.320]   might, I want to highlight, might prove useful
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:16.220]   in adjusting the symptoms of OCD,
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:17.480]   and I hope that this is an area
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:20.900]   that researchers are going to pursue in the very near future
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:24.540]   because many of the treatments for reducing DHEA
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:27.060]   or increasing testosterone or reducing cortisol
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:29.880]   have already made it through FDA approval.
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.380]   They're out there, they're readily prescribed.
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.980]   Many of them are already in generic form,
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:36.400]   which means that the patents have already lapsed
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:39.160]   on the first versions of those drugs,
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:41.480]   so when they're available as generic drugs,
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:44.660]   very often they're available at significantly lower cost.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:46.020]   There's a whole discussion to be had there
[01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:49.460]   about patent laws and prescription drugs,
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:52.080]   but because these drugs are largely available
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:55.680]   in prescription yet generic form,
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:57.760]   I think there's a great opportunity to explore
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:01.720]   how hormones, not just cortisol, testosterone, and DHEA,
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:04.080]   but the huge category of hormones
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:06.480]   might impact the symptoms of OCD,
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:09.200]   especially since many of the symptoms of OCD
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:11.220]   show up right around the time of puberty.
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:13.080]   We haven't talked a lot about childhood OCD
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:14.680]   'cause we're going to do an entire series
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.620]   on childhood psychiatric disorders and challenges,
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:21.980]   but many children develop OCD early,
[01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:24.240]   as young as three or four, believe it or not,
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.000]   or even six or seven and 10,
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.840]   and in adolescence and certainly around puberty
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:30.500]   and in young adulthood.
[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:32.560]   It is rare, although it does happen,
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:34.940]   that people will develop OCD very late in life,
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:37.700]   around 40 or older, just kind of spontaneously.
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:39.580]   Most often when you look at their clinical history,
[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:41.560]   you find that either they were hiding it
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:43.300]   or it was being suppressed in some way,
[01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:46.100]   or if it does spontaneously show up late in life,
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:49.040]   like mid thirties or in ones forties,
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:52.520]   typically there's a traumatic brain injury.
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:55.220]   It could be due to stroke or physical injury to the head
[01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:57.120]   or something of that sort.
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:00.600]   Nonetheless, there is a interesting correlation
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:03.320]   between the onset of puberty in certain forms of OCD.
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:05.380]   There's certain forms of, or I should say,
[02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:08.120]   there's certain aspects of menopause that can relate to OCD.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:10.220]   You can find all these things in the literature,
[02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:13.120]   all this to say that hormones impact neurotransmitters
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:15.020]   and neuromodulators, which clearly impact
[02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:17.180]   the kinds of circuits that are involved in OCD,
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:19.100]   and it makes sense that,
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:21.580]   and I would hope that there would be an exploration
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:23.360]   of how these hormones impact OCD
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:24.700]   in the not too distant future.
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:26.100]   Now, there is an extensive literature
[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:27.940]   exploring how testosterone therapy,
[02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:32.940]   both in males and females, can be effective in some cases
[02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:36.520]   in the treatment of anxiety-related disorders,
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:40.100]   but not, at least to my knowledge, in OCD in particular.
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:43.100]   So this whole area of the use of testosterone
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.260]   and estrogen therapies, DHEA, cortisol suppression,
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:49.860]   or maybe even enhancement for the treatment of OCD
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:52.300]   is essentially a big black box
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:56.500]   that very soon I believe will be lit.
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:58.900]   I realize that a number of listeners of this podcast
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:02.540]   are probably interested in the non-typical
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:05.500]   or holistic treatments for OCD.
[02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:07.860]   Dr. Blair Simpson's lab has at least one study
[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:11.360]   exploring the role of mindfulness meditation
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:14.280]   for the treatment of OCD.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:17.300]   There, the data are a little bit complicated,
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:21.520]   and I should mention that good things are happening,
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:24.020]   at least in the United States, probably elsewhere as well,
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:27.620]   but good things are happening in terms of the exploration
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:29.880]   of things like meditation and other,
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:32.020]   let's call them non-traditional or holistic forms
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:34.660]   of treatment for psychiatric disorders
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:37.180]   because of the division of complementary health
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:38.300]   that's now been launched
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:39.580]   by the National Institutes of Health.
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:43.520]   So whereas before people would think about meditation
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:48.520]   or yoga nidra or even CBD supplementation for that matter
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:50.920]   as kind of fringe maybe or kind of woo
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:53.620]   or non-traditional at the very least,
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:55.640]   the National Institutes of Health in the United States
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:59.200]   has now devoted an entire division,
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:02.360]   an entire institute purely for the exploration
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.700]   of things like breathing practices, meditation, et cetera.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:06.120]   So there's a cancer institute,
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:07.840]   there's a hearing and deafness institute,
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.520]   there's a vision institute,
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:11.540]   and now there's this complementary health institute,
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:14.560]   which I think is a wonderful addition
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:17.960]   to the more traditional aspects of medicine.
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:21.960]   I think no possible useful treatment should be overlooked
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.680]   or unresearched in my opinion,
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:25.780]   provided that can be done safely.
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:28.600]   And as I mentioned, Dr. Blair Simpson's lab
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:31.580]   has looked at the role of mindfulness meditation
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:33.280]   in the treatment of OCD.
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.940]   Now, we should all keep in mind, no pun intended,
[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:39.880]   that most of the data on mindfulness meditation
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:43.800]   shows that it increases the ability to focus.
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:46.400]   Now, this brings us back to a kind of repeating theme today,
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:49.280]   which is that increased focus may not be the best thing
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:54.080]   for somebody with OCD because it might increase focus
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.000]   on the obsession and or compulsion.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.780]   Turns out that mindfulness meditation
[02:02:58.780 --> 02:03:00.940]   can be useful in the treatment of OCD,
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:05.940]   but mainly by way of how it impacts the focus on
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:10.000]   and the ability to engage in cognitive behavioral therapies.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.260]   So it's very unlikely, at least by my read of the data,
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.500]   to be a direct effect of meditation
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:16.660]   on relieving the symptoms.
[02:03:16.660 --> 02:03:19.500]   Rather, it seems that meditation is increasing focus
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:23.020]   on things like cognitive behavioral therapy homework
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:24.680]   and to not focus on other things
[02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:28.080]   and therefore indirectly improving the symptoms of OCD.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:29.880]   Now, somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.600]   there have also been a fairly large number of studies
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.560]   exploring how nutraceuticals,
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.340]   as they're sometimes called supplements,
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:38.600]   that are available over the counter
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:41.720]   can impact the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder.
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:44.960]   Now, there's such an extensive number of different compounds
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:47.300]   and supplements that fall under the category
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:49.260]   of nutraceuticals and that have been explored
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:51.060]   in the treatment of OCD that I'd like to point you
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:53.540]   to a review that is entitled
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:54.920]   "Nutraceuticals and the Treatment
[02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:56.960]   of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,"
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.480]   a review, excuse me, of mechanistic and clinical evidence.
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:04.460]   This was published in 2011, so it's over 10 years old.
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:06.700]   And so by now, I have to imagine
[02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:10.260]   that there are an enormous number of additional substances
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:11.400]   that could be explored.
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.340]   But there are just one or two here that I want to focus on.
[02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:18.140]   Here in this review, they describe effects of 5-HTP
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:21.020]   and tryptophan, so things that are in the serotonin pathway,
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.860]   which would make sense given what we know about the SSRIs
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:26.020]   that people would explore how different supplements
[02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:30.320]   that increase serotonergic transmission might impact OCD.
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:32.980]   What you find is that they do have significant effects
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:36.680]   in improving or reducing the symptoms of OCD
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:39.420]   in somewhat similar way to some of the SSRIs.
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:41.380]   But you, of course, have to be careful.
[02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:45.380]   Anything that's going to tap into a given neurochemical system
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:48.780]   to the same degree may very likely
[02:04:48.780 --> 02:04:50.120]   have the same sorts of side effects
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:51.620]   that a prescription drug would.
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:53.440]   One compound that I'd like to focus on
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:54.700]   in a little more depth, however,
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:59.260]   because it's exciting and interesting to me is inositol.
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:01.360]   Inositol is a compound that we are going to talk about
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:05.060]   in several future podcasts because, well, first of all,
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:07.420]   it seems that it can have impressive effects
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:09.000]   on reducing anxiety.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.540]   It also can have pretty impressive effects
[02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:13.360]   in improving fertility, in particular in women
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:15.820]   with polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:18.520]   And here I'm referring specifically to myoinositol
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:20.140]   because it comes in several forms.
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:23.740]   And it does appear that 900 milligrams of inositol
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:26.940]   can improve sleep and can reduce anxiety,
[02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:30.200]   perhaps when taken at that dosage or higher dosages.
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:33.260]   I will just confess, first of all, I don't have OCD,
[02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:35.480]   although I will also confess that when I was a child,
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:37.180]   I had a transient tic.
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:39.080]   I've talked about this on podcasts before.
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:40.100]   It was a grunting tic.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:41.440]   So when I was about six or seven,
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:44.740]   I recall a trip to Washington, D.C. with my family
[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:49.740]   where I was feeling a strong desire or need even,
[02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:53.760]   as I recall, to grunt in order to clear something
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:56.160]   in my throat, but I didn't have anything in my throat.
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:58.080]   I didn't have a cold or any post-nasal drip.
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:00.100]   It was really just the feeling that I needed to do that
[02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:02.340]   to release some sort of tension.
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:05.300]   And I remember my dad at the time telling me,
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:06.140]   "Don't do that.
[02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:06.960]   "You know, don't do that.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.600]   "It's not good to grunt," or something like that.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:11.140]   I think he saw that it was kind of compulsive behavior.
[02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:12.880]   And so I would actually hide in the back seat
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:15.300]   of the rental car and do it, or I'd hide in my room.
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:17.020]   Fortunately for me, it was transient.
[02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:19.680]   I think about six months or a year later, it disappeared.
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:22.760]   Although I did notice, actually an ex-girlfriend of mine
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:24.500]   pointed out that when I get very tired
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:26.040]   and I've been working very long hours,
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:28.580]   sometimes that grunting tic will reappear.
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:29.420]   What does that mean?
[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:30.320]   Do I have Tourette's?
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.160]   I don't know.
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:32.760]   Maybe I was never diagnosed with Tourette's.
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:34.120]   Do I have OCD?
[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:35.440]   Maybe.
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:37.100]   I certainly could be accused of having
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.320]   obsessive compulsive personality disorder,
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:42.380]   which we'll talk about still in a few minutes.
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:45.200]   But the point here is that many children
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:49.720]   transiently express tics or low-level Tourette's or OCD,
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:52.680]   and again, transiently, and it disappears over time.
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:54.800]   So inositol has been explored
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:56.240]   in a bunch of different contexts,
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:58.880]   including for tics and OCD, et cetera.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:03.300]   Going back to inositol and its current use,
[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:04.360]   or I should say my current use,
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:07.200]   I've been taking 900 milligrams of inositol
[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:10.680]   as an addition to my existing toolkit for sleep,
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:13.240]   which I've talked about many times on this podcast
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:14.480]   and other podcasts,
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.260]   consists of magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine.
[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:19.680]   If you want to know more about that kit,
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:21.360]   you can go to our newsletter,
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.580]   neural network newsletter at hubermanlab.com.
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:24.800]   The toolkit for sleep is there.
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:26.480]   You don't even have to sign up for the newsletter,
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:27.880]   but it'll give you a flavor of the sorts of things
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:29.040]   that are in the newsletter.
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:32.960]   In any case, I've been experimenting a bit
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:35.520]   with taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol,
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:37.600]   either alone or in combination with that sleep kit,
[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.880]   and I must say the sleep I've been getting on inositol
[02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:43.440]   is extremely deep and does seem to lead
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:46.000]   to enhanced levels of focus and alertness during the day,
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:46.920]   and perhaps you're noticing that
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.480]   'cause I'm talking more quickly on this podcast
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:49.420]   than in previous podcasts.
[02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:50.260]   No, I'm just kidding.
[02:07:50.260 --> 02:07:51.400]   I don't think the two things relate
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.360]   in any kind of causal way.
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:56.380]   The point here is that inositol is known
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:59.360]   to be pretty effective in reducing anxiety,
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:01.360]   but when taken at very high dosages.
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:03.100]   Can it do the same at low dosages?
[02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:03.940]   We don't know.
[02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:06.560]   I would consider 900 milligrams a low dose.
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:10.140]   Most of this, given the fact that most of the studies
[02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:13.400]   of inositol have explored very high dosages,
[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:16.340]   like even 10 or 12 grams per day,
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:18.780]   which I must say seems exceedingly high,
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:20.500]   and they do report that some of the subjects
[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:23.360]   in those experiments actually stopped taking the inositol
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:26.260]   because of gastric discomfort or gastric distress
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:27.540]   as it's called.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:30.100]   So I've reported my results with sleep
[02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.160]   in a kind of anecdotal way.
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:33.520]   They certainly aren't peer-reviewed studies
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:35.640]   that I described about my own experience
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:36.880]   in an anecdotal way.
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:41.460]   But nonetheless, it's been explored that things like glycine,
[02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:43.800]   which is another, which is an amino acid,
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:45.760]   which also acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:47.600]   in the brain, taken at very high dosages,
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:49.140]   60 grams per day.
[02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:52.840]   That is a absolutely astonishingly high amount of glycine.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:55.080]   I would not recommend taking that much glycine
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.100]   unless you're part of a study where they tell you to
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:58.940]   and you know it's safe.
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:01.960]   18 grams, excuse me, of inositol.
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:04.700]   These are very, very high dosages used in these studies.
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:08.520]   Nonetheless, there's some interesting data about inositol
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:13.520]   leading to some alleviation of OCD symptoms
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:16.520]   or partial alleviation of OCD symptoms
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:18.520]   in as little as two weeks
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:21.760]   after initiating the supplement protocol.
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:23.960]   So I think there's a great future for these nutraceuticals,
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:26.040]   meaning I think more systematic exploration,
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:27.360]   in particular of lower dosages
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:29.800]   in the context of OCD treatment.
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:33.720]   And as we saw before for the SSRIs
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:35.580]   and other prescription drug treatments,
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:37.680]   I think there really needs to be an exploration
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:39.620]   of these nutraceuticals in combination
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:41.120]   with behavioral therapies and who knows,
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:42.480]   maybe with brain-machine interface
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.220]   like cranial magnetic stimulation as well.
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:47.120]   Now, way back at the beginning of the episode,
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:50.420]   I alluded to the fact that OCD is one thing,
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:51.680]   obsessive compulsive disorder,
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:54.080]   and it's truly a disorder and it's truly debilitating
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:55.600]   and it's extremely common.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:58.000]   And then there's this other thing
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.360]   called obsessive compulsive personality disorder,
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:01.900]   which is distinct from that,
[02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:05.000]   does not have the intrusive component.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.600]   So people don't feel overwhelmed
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:09.640]   or overtaken by these thoughts.
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.480]   Rather, they find that the obsessions
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.560]   can sometimes serve them or they even welcome them.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.660]   And I think many of us know people like this.
[02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:20.120]   I perhaps even could be accused or who knows,
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:23.080]   maybe have been accused of having an obsessive compulsive
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:25.000]   personality at times.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.180]   Why do I draw this distinction?
[02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:30.000]   Well, first of all, we've come to a point in human history,
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.580]   I think in large part because of social media,
[02:10:32.580 --> 02:10:34.920]   but also in large part because there are a number
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:37.680]   of discussions being held about mental health
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:42.440]   that have brought terms like trauma, depression, OCD,
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:45.920]   et cetera, into the common vernacular
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:48.800]   so that people will say, "Oh, you're so OCD,"
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:51.060]   or someone will say, "I was traumatized by that,"
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:53.040]   or, "I was traumatized by this."
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:54.440]   We should be very careful, right?
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:56.760]   I'm certainly not the word police,
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:59.640]   but we should be very careful in the use
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:02.580]   of certain types of language, especially language
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:06.780]   that has real psychiatric and psychological definitions
[02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:09.720]   because it can really draw us off course
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:11.900]   in providing relief for some of these syndromes.
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:15.280]   For instance, the word trauma is thrown around
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:17.680]   left and right nowadays, "I was traumatized by this,"
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:20.520]   or, "That caused trauma," or, "You're giving me trauma."
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:23.800]   Listen, I realize that many people are traumatized
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:26.600]   by certain events, including things that are said to them.
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:27.940]   I absolutely acknowledge that.
[02:11:27.940 --> 02:11:31.040]   Hence, our episodes on trauma and trauma treatment,
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:35.920]   several of them, in fact, Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:39.120]   and then dedicated solo episodes with just me blabbing
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:41.640]   about trauma and trauma treatment.
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:44.920]   But as Dr. Conti so appropriately pointed out,
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.780]   trauma is really something that changes our neural circuitry
[02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:52.640]   and therefore our thoughts and our behaviors
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:55.500]   in a very persistent way that is detrimental to us.
[02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:57.620]   Not every bad event is traumatizing.
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:11:59.840]   Not everything that we dislike or even that we hate
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:02.020]   or that feels terrible to us is traumatizing.
[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:04.840]   For something to reach the level of trauma,
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:07.680]   it really needs to change our neural circuitry
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:09.640]   and therefore our thoughts and our behaviors
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:12.560]   in a persistent way that is maladaptive for us.
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:17.160]   Similarly, just calling someone obsessive is one thing,
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:20.080]   saying that someone has OCD or assuming one has OCD
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:22.960]   simply because they have a personality or a phenotype,
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:25.240]   as we say, where they need things in perfect order,
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:27.040]   like I find myself correcting these pens,
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.420]   making sure that the caps are facing in the same direction,
[02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:32.600]   for instance, right now.
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:35.240]   That is not the same as OCD.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.160]   If, for instance, I can tolerate these pens
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:38.420]   being at different orientation
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:40.200]   or even throw the cap on the floor or something,
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:42.000]   it doesn't create a lot of anxiety for me.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.160]   I confess I agree it's a little bit in the moment,
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:45.960]   but then I can forget about it and move on.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:47.680]   That's one of the key distinctions
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:50.600]   between obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.800]   and obsessive compulsive disorder in its strictest form.
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:57.360]   Now, once one hears that OCD is different
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:12:59.880]   than obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:01.040]   because of this difference
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:03.680]   in how intrusive the thoughts are or not,
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.200]   then that's useful, but it really doesn't tell us anything
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.400]   about what is happening mechanistically
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.520]   in one situation or another.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.460]   Fortunately, there are beautiful data,
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:15.720]   again, from Dr. Blair Simpson's lab,
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:17.900]   and you can tell based on the number of studies
[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:19.560]   that I've referred to from her laboratory,
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:22.880]   that she's truly one of the luminaries in this field,
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:26.740]   that there really are some fundamental wiring differences
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:29.540]   and behavioral differences and psychological differences
[02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:32.360]   between people who have obsessive compulsive disorder
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:34.160]   and those who have obsessive compulsive
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:36.440]   personality disorder.
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:39.960]   So this is a study first authored by Pinto, P-I-N-T-O,
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.220]   entitled "Capacity to Delay Reward
[02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:44.200]   Differentiates Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:47.400]   and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder."
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:50.840]   And the methods in this study were to take 25 people with OCD
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:54.800]   and 25 people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:57.360]   and 25 people who have both,
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.840]   because it is possible to have both,
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:13:59.920]   and that's important to point out,
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:02.000]   and 25 so-called healthy controls,
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.680]   people that don't have obsessive compulsive
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:07.160]   personality disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.720]   They take clinical assessments,
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:11.200]   and then they took a number of tests
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:15.680]   that probed their ability to defer gratification,
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.020]   something called in the laboratory,
[02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:18.560]   we call it delayed discounting.
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:23.040]   So their ability to defer gratification through a task
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:25.260]   where they can either accept reward right away
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:26.400]   or accept reward later.
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:28.880]   Some of you may have heard of the two marshmallow task.
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:31.560]   This is based on a study that was performed years ago
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.720]   on young children at Stanford and elsewhere,
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:36.140]   where they take young children into a room.
[02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:39.140]   They offer them a marshmallow.
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:41.260]   Kids like marshmallows generally.
[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:44.240]   And you say, "You can eat the marshmallow right now,
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:46.400]   or you can wait some period of time.
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:49.360]   And if you are able to wait and not eat the marshmallow,
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:50.960]   you can have two marshmallows."
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:53.140]   And in general, children want two marshmallows
[02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:54.660]   more than they want one marshmallow.
[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:56.980]   So really what you're probing is their ability
[02:14:56.980 --> 02:14:59.000]   to access delayed gratification.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.540]   And they're very entertaining,
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:06.540]   even truly amusing videos of this on the internet.
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:09.440]   So if you just do two marshmallow task video
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.280]   and you go into YouTube,
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.220]   what you'll find is that the children will use
[02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:16.100]   all sorts of strategies to delay gratification.
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:18.700]   Some of the kids will cover the marshmallow.
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:20.260]   Others will talk to the marshmallow and say,
[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:21.660]   "I know you're not that delicious.
[02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:23.380]   You look delicious, but no, you're not delicious."
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:24.700]   They'll engage with the marshmallow
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:25.740]   in all sorts of cute ways.
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:27.920]   They'll turn around and try and, you know, avoidance,
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:30.960]   which actually speaks to a whole category of behaviors
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:32.560]   that people with OCD also use.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:34.200]   I'm not saying these kids had OCD,
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:38.620]   but avoidance behaviors are very much a component of OCD.
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:40.400]   People really trying to avoid the thing
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:43.420]   that evokes the obsession.
[02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:47.180]   Well, some kids are able to delay gratification, some aren't.
[02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:48.640]   And it's debatable as to whether or not
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.480]   the kids that are able to delay gratification
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:52.340]   go on to have more successful lives or not.
[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:54.140]   Initially, that was the conclusion of those studies.
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:55.380]   There's still a lot of debate about it.
[02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:57.020]   We'll bring an expert on to give us
[02:15:57.020 --> 02:15:58.800]   the final conclusion on this 'cause there is one
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:01.020]   and it's very interesting and not intuitive.
[02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:04.560]   Nonetheless, adults are also faced with decisions
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:06.660]   every day, all day as to whether or not
[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:08.840]   they can delay gratification.
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:13.340]   And this study used a, not a two marshmallow task,
[02:16:13.340 --> 02:16:17.340]   but a game that involved rewards where people could delay
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:19.280]   in order to get greater rewards later.
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:20.640]   What is the conclusion?
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:23.000]   Well, first of all, obsessive compulsive
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.980]   and obsessive compulsive personality disorder subjects
[02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:30.660]   both showed impairments in their psychosocial functioning
[02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:31.820]   and quality of life.
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:34.240]   They had compulsive behavior.
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:36.300]   So these are people that are suffering in their life
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:39.060]   because their compulsions are really strong.
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:42.020]   So it's not just being really nitpicky or really orderly
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:44.140]   in one case and having full blown OCD in the other,
[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:47.300]   both sets of subjects are challenged in life
[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:49.100]   because they're having relationship issues
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.660]   or job related issues, et cetera,
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:52.360]   because they are that compulsive.
[02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:56.460]   However, the individuals with obsessive compulsive
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:58.540]   personality disorder,
[02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:01.900]   they discounted the value of delayed gratification
[02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:03.260]   significantly less than those
[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:05.360]   with obsessive compulsive disorder.
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.420]   What do I mean?
[02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:09.020]   They are both impairing disorders
[02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:10.540]   that are marked by compulsive behaviors.
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:13.420]   Here I'm paraphrasing, but they can be differentiated
[02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:15.460]   by the presence of obsessions in OCD.
[02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:17.380]   So obsessions in OCD.
[02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:22.380]   People with OCD are absolutely fixated on certain ideas
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:24.260]   and those ideas are intrusive.
[02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:26.180]   Again, that's the hallmark theme.
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:29.180]   And by an excessive capacity to delay reward
[02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:31.420]   in obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
[02:17:31.420 --> 02:17:34.380]   That is people who have obsessive compulsive personality
[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:38.180]   disorder are really good at delaying gratification.
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:41.620]   So they are able to concentrate very intensely
[02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:45.000]   and perform very intensely in ways that allow them
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.300]   to instill order such that they can delay reward.
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:53.620]   Now you can see why this contour of symptoms,
[02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:57.300]   meaning that the people with OCD
[02:17:57.300 --> 02:18:00.900]   are experiencing intrusive thoughts,
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:03.000]   whereas the people with obsessive compulsive
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.140]   personality disorder show an enhanced ability
[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:07.800]   to defer gratification.
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:11.340]   You could see how that would lead
[02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:12.780]   to very different outcomes.
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:15.540]   People with obsessive compulsive personality disorder
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:18.580]   can actually leverage that personality disorder
[02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:21.060]   to perform better in certain domains of life.
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:23.020]   Not all domains of life, because remember again,
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:26.520]   these people are in this study and they're showing up
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:28.220]   as experiencing challenges in life
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:31.380]   because of their obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:33.800]   Nonetheless, people with obsessive compulsive
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:36.580]   personality disorder, you can imagine would be very good
[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:40.620]   at say architecture or anything that involves instilling
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:43.460]   a ton of order, maybe sushi chef, for instance,
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:44.780]   maybe a chef in general.
[02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:46.740]   I know chefs that just kind of throw things around
[02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:50.060]   like the chef on "The Muppets" and just throw things
[02:18:50.060 --> 02:18:51.520]   everywhere and still produce amazing food.
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.360]   And then there's some people
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:54.260]   where they're incredibly exacting.
[02:18:54.260 --> 02:18:55.780]   They're just incredibly precise.
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.400]   I think that movie, what is it, "Hero Dreams of Sushi,"
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:00.340]   that movie is incredible.
[02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:02.140]   Certainly not saying he has obsessive compulsive
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:04.300]   personality disorder, but I think it's fair to say
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:08.420]   that he is obsessive or extremely meticulous
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:10.900]   and orderly about everything from start to finish.
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:13.720]   You can imagine a huge array of different occupations
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:16.340]   and life endeavors where this would be beneficial.
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:18.480]   Science being one of them, where data collection
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:22.020]   and analysis is exceedingly important that one be precise,
[02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:25.660]   or mathematics or physics or engineering,
[02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:28.180]   anything where precision has a payoff
[02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:32.060]   and gaining precision takes time and delay
[02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:34.180]   of immediate gratification.
[02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:35.740]   You can imagine that obsessive compulsive
[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:38.040]   personality disorder would synergize well
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:40.180]   with those sorts of activities and professions.
[02:19:40.180 --> 02:19:43.100]   Whereas obsessive compulsive disorder is really intrusive.
[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:46.420]   It's preventing functionality in many different
[02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:47.700]   domains of life.
[02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:52.460]   So the key takeaway here is that when we use the words
[02:19:52.460 --> 02:19:54.540]   obsessive compulsive, or we call someone
[02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:56.740]   obsessive compulsive, or we are trying to evaluate
[02:19:56.740 --> 02:19:58.460]   whether or not we are obsessive compulsive,
[02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:02.200]   it's very important that we highlight
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:05.460]   that obsessive compulsive disorder is very intrusive.
[02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:07.860]   It involves intrusive thoughts and it interrupts
[02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:09.080]   with normal functioning in life.
[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:11.460]   Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder,
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:14.220]   while it can interrupt normal functioning in life,
[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:16.540]   it also can be productive.
[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:19.020]   It can enhance functioning in life, not just in work,
[02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:21.080]   but perhaps at home as well.
[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:23.400]   If you are somebody and you have family members
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:26.220]   that really place enormous value on having a beautiful
[02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:27.540]   and highly organized home,
[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:29.900]   well then it could lend itself well to that.
[02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:31.560]   It's going to be a matter of degrees, of course.
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:33.100]   None of these things is an absolute,
[02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:34.260]   it's going to be on a continuum.
[02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:36.640]   But I think it is fair to say that obsessive compulsive
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:40.380]   disorder, whether or not in mild, moderate or severe form
[02:20:40.380 --> 02:20:43.380]   is impairing normal functioning.
[02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:45.900]   Whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder,
[02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:48.220]   there's a range of expressions of that,
[02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:49.540]   some of which can be adaptive,
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:51.020]   some of which can be maladaptive.
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:53.640]   And again, it's all going to depend on context.
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:56.580]   Before we conclude, I do want to touch on something
[02:20:56.580 --> 02:20:58.500]   that I think a lot of people experience
[02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:00.560]   and that's superstitions.
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:02.060]   Superstitions are fascinating
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:05.600]   and there's some fascinating research on superstitions.
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:08.620]   One particular study that I'm a big fan of
[02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:11.220]   is the work of Ben Solevsky at Harvard.
[02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:14.520]   He studies motor sequences and motor learning.
[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:17.500]   And he has beautiful data on how people learn,
[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:19.480]   for instance, a tennis swing
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:23.140]   and the patterns that they engage in early on.
[02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:25.260]   And then the patterns of swinging that they,
[02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:26.620]   swinging the racket that is,
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:29.700]   that they engage in later as they acquire more skill.
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:32.900]   And basically the takeaway is that the amount of error
[02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:36.980]   or variation from swing to swing is dramatically reduced
[02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:38.140]   as they acquire skill.
[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:41.320]   That's all fine and good.
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:43.580]   And there's some beautiful mechanistic data
[02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:46.120]   that he and others have discovered
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.200]   to support how that comes to be.
[02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:50.900]   But they also explore animal models,
[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:55.300]   in particular rats pressing sequences of buttons and levers
[02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:57.300]   to obtain a reward.
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:59.480]   Believe it or not, rats are pretty smart.
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:00.940]   I've seen this with my own eyes.
[02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:04.420]   You can teach a rat to press a lever for a pellet of food.
[02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:07.340]   Rats can also learn to press levers
[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:11.260]   in a particular sequence in order to gain a piece of food.
[02:22:11.260 --> 02:22:15.300]   And they can actually learn to press an enormous number
[02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:17.220]   of levers in very particular sequences
[02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:19.180]   in order to obtain pellets of food.
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:21.520]   You can also give them little buttons to press
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:25.880]   or even a paddle to, or I should say a pedal, excuse me,
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:27.360]   to stomp on with their foot
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.140]   in order to obtain a pedal of food.
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:32.060]   Basically rats can learn exactly what they need to do
[02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:34.740]   in order to obtain a piece of food,
[02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:37.540]   especially if they're made a little bit hungry first.
[02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:40.900]   Benson's lab has published beautiful data showing
[02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:43.620]   that as animals and humans
[02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:45.760]   come to learn a particular motor sequence,
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:49.060]   very often they will introduce motor patterns
[02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:52.820]   in that sequence that are irrelevant to the outcome
[02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:54.560]   and yet that persist.
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:56.140]   If you've ever watched a game of baseball,
[02:22:56.140 --> 02:22:58.060]   you've seen this before.
[02:22:58.060 --> 02:23:00.260]   Oftentimes the pitcher up on the mound
[02:23:00.260 --> 02:23:03.940]   will bring the ball to their chin.
[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:05.500]   They'll look over their shoulder,
[02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:07.780]   they'll look back over the other shoulder,
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:09.860]   and then they will, of course,
[02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:11.760]   reel back and pitch the ball.
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:12.980]   But if you watch closely,
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:15.460]   oftentimes there are components in the motor sequence
[02:23:15.460 --> 02:23:17.940]   which are completely unrelated to the pitch.
[02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:19.600]   They're not looking necessarily to see
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:21.120]   if someone's stealing a base.
[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:24.220]   They're not necessarily looking down at home plate
[02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:25.980]   where the batter is.
[02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:27.540]   They're also doing things like
[02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:28.620]   touching the back of their ear
[02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:30.460]   before they bring the ball to their chin
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:31.620]   or adjusting their hat.
[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:33.220]   And if you watch individual pitchers,
[02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:35.220]   what you'll find is that they'll do the same sequence
[02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:38.260]   of completely irrelevant motor patterns
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:40.560]   before each and every single pitch.
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:43.900]   Similarly, rats that have been trained to, for instance,
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:47.060]   hit two levers and step on a pedal
[02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:49.140]   with their left hind foot
[02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:53.180]   and then tap a button up above that is the red button
[02:23:53.180 --> 02:23:55.640]   will do that to gain a piece of food.
[02:23:55.640 --> 02:23:57.700]   But sometimes they'll also introduce a pattern
[02:23:57.700 --> 02:23:58.980]   into that motor sequence
[02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:01.660]   where they will shake their tail a little bit
[02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:02.780]   or they'll turn their head a little bit
[02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:05.620]   or they'll move their ears a little bit, et cetera.
[02:24:05.620 --> 02:24:07.400]   Motor patterns that have nothing to do
[02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:10.940]   with obtaining the particular outcome in mind.
[02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:13.560]   In other words, you could eliminate certain components
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:15.380]   of the motor sequence and it would not matter.
[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.580]   The rat would still get the pellet.
[02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:19.500]   The pitcher would still be able to pitch.
[02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:21.660]   And yet that can introduce because somehow
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:25.660]   because they were performed again and again,
[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:28.780]   prior to successful trials,
[02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:32.380]   the rat or the human baseball pitcher
[02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:34.420]   comes to believe in some way
[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:37.160]   that it was involved in generating the outcome,
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:39.100]   hence superstition, right?
[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:41.380]   I confess I have a few superstitions.
[02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:43.420]   I occasionally will knock on wood.
[02:24:43.420 --> 02:24:45.000]   I'll say something that I want to happen
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.060]   and I'll say, oh, knock on wood and I'll just do it.
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:49.600]   And occasionally I'll challenge myself and think,
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:50.640]   ah, I don't want to knock,
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:52.300]   don't knock on wood, Andrew, don't do that.
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:53.260]   You know, no one,
[02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:55.340]   I don't think anyone wants to be superstitious.
[02:24:55.340 --> 02:24:56.220]   I certainly don't.
[02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:57.980]   And so every once in a while, I'll just challenge it
[02:24:57.980 --> 02:25:00.860]   and I won't actually knock on wood.
[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:02.660]   I'm admitting this to you to kind of,
[02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:05.460]   I guess, normalize some of this.
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:09.180]   Some people have superstitions that border on
[02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:12.000]   or even become compulsions.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.900]   They really come to believe that if they don't knock on wood
[02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:16.300]   that something terrible is going to happen,
[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:18.220]   maybe something in particular.
[02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:19.860]   Or in the case of the baseball pitcher,
[02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:21.580]   they come to believe that if they don't touch
[02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:24.560]   their right ear before they reel back on the pitch,
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:27.820]   that the pitch won't be any good
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:29.140]   or that they're going to lose the game.
[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:30.540]   I don't know what their thought process is.
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:32.700]   Now, I also don't know what the rat is thinking,
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:36.160]   but the rat is clearly doing something
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:40.000]   or thinking something is related to the final outcome.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.240]   I don't know of any studies where they've intervened
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:46.020]   with the particular superstition-like behaviors of the rat
[02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:49.620]   to see whether or not the rat somehow doesn't continue
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:51.320]   to do the motor sequence to get the pellet.
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:52.160]   We don't know.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:54.260]   The rats, I don't speak rat, most people don't.
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:56.400]   Or if you speak to a rat, if it speaks back,
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:57.240]   it's not in English.
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:01.480]   Anyway, the point is that superstitions are beliefs
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:05.840]   that we on an individual scale come to believe
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:09.480]   are linked to the probability of an outcome
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:11.560]   when in fact we know,
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:14.000]   we actually know in our rational minds,
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.960]   they have no real relationship to the outcome.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:20.960]   Superstitions can become full-blown compulsions
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:25.160]   and obsessions when we repeat them often enough
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:26.560]   that they become automatic.
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:28.860]   And I think this is what we observe most of the time
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:31.360]   when we see a pitcher touching their ear,
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.680]   or for instance, in tennis, you see this a lot.
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:36.940]   You'll see someone, they'll slap their shoes often.
[02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:39.540]   I see this, they'll slap the undersides of their soles.
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:41.680]   They may tell themselves that this is, I don't know,
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:43.520]   maybe moving out some of the dust or something
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:45.700]   in the bottoms of their soles that gives them more traction
[02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:47.520]   and they want that to be ready for the serve
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.900]   or something like that.
[02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:50.280]   And maybe there's some truth to that.
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:53.440]   But here, what we're referring to are behaviors
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:56.120]   that really have no rational relationship to the outcome.
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:58.340]   And yet we perform in a compulsive way.
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:03.340]   People with OCD, yes, tend to have more superstitions.
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.520]   People with more superstitions, yes,
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:08.360]   tend to have a tendency towards OCD.
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:10.680]   And I should mention obsessive compulsive
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:12.120]   personality disorder.
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:15.760]   If you think way back to the first part of this episode,
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:17.960]   when I was just describing what the brain does, right?
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:18.780]   What does your brain do?
[02:27:18.780 --> 02:27:20.680]   Housekeeping functions to keep you alive.
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:22.960]   And it's a prediction machine.
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:26.640]   Your neural circuits, you have an enormous amount
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:29.200]   of biological investment of real estate,
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.680]   literally cells and chemicals that are there
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:34.600]   to try and make your world predictable
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:36.560]   and to try and give you control
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:39.340]   or at least the sense of control over that world.
[02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:42.300]   And that's a normal process.
[02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:45.880]   Low-level superstitions, moderate superstitions
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:50.100]   represent a kind of a healthy range, I would say,
[02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:55.080]   of behaviors that are aimed at generating predictability
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:57.220]   that don't disrupt normal function.
[02:27:57.220 --> 02:27:59.180]   Obsessive compulsive personality disorder,
[02:27:59.180 --> 02:28:00.380]   provided it's not too severe,
[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:04.420]   would I think represent the next level along that continuum.
[02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:06.300]   And then obsessive compulsive disorder,
[02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:07.720]   as I pointed out earlier,
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:11.620]   is really a case of highly debilitating, highly intrusive,
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:14.180]   really overtake of neural circuitry
[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:15.520]   over our thoughts and behaviors
[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:19.800]   that requires very dedicated, very persistent.
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:22.180]   And very effective treatments
[02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:25.180]   in order to stop those obsessions and compulsions
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:29.100]   and the anxiety that links them somewhat counterintuitively
[02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:31.580]   by teaching people to tolerate
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:35.020]   that level of increased anxiety and interrupt those patterns.
[02:28:35.020 --> 02:28:36.980]   Unfortunately, as we described earlier,
[02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:38.340]   such treatments exist.
[02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:42.060]   Cognitive behavioral therapy, drug treatments like SSRIs,
[02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:43.340]   though also drug treatments
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:46.220]   that tap into the glutamate system
[02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:49.600]   and into perhaps also the dopamine system,
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:50.860]   the so-called neuroleptics.
[02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:53.300]   And then as we described,
[02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:54.900]   there's now an extensive exploration
[02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:58.200]   of things like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis.
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:00.380]   The initial studies don't seem to hold much promise
[02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:02.540]   for cannabis and CBD in the treatment of OCD,
[02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:04.700]   but who knows, maybe more studies will come along
[02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:06.620]   that will change that story.
[02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:08.080]   And then of course, brain-machine interface,
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:10.100]   like transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:12.660]   And then just to remind you what I already told you before,
[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:15.360]   combinations of behavioral and drug treatments
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:16.600]   and brain-machine interface,
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:18.380]   I think is really where the future lies.
[02:29:18.380 --> 02:29:20.960]   Fortunately, good treatments exist.
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:24.960]   We cannot say that any one individual treatment
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:26.180]   works for everybody.
[02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:29.380]   There are fairly large percentages of people
[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:31.480]   that won't respond to one set of treatments or another,
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:34.040]   and therefore one has to try different ones.
[02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:37.780]   And then there are the so-called supplementation-based
[02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:39.760]   or more holistic therapies.
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:41.940]   Today, I've tried to cover each and all of these
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:44.860]   in a fairly substantial amount of detail.
[02:29:44.860 --> 02:29:47.620]   I realize this is a fairly long episode.
[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:49.560]   That is intentional.
[02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:51.740]   Much like our episode on ADHD,
[02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:54.140]   on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[02:29:54.140 --> 02:29:57.820]   I received an enormous number of requests to talk about OCD.
[02:29:57.820 --> 02:30:00.060]   And my decision to make this a very long
[02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:02.980]   and detailed episode about OCD
[02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:04.620]   really doesn't stem from any desire
[02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:07.540]   to subject you to too much information
[02:30:07.540 --> 02:30:11.580]   or to avoid the opportunity to just list things off.
[02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:13.580]   What I've tried to provide is an opportunity
[02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:15.960]   to really drill deep into the neural circuitry
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:18.360]   and an understanding of where OCD comes from,
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:20.760]   how OCD is different from things like
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:22.940]   the personality disorders that I described,
[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:26.820]   and also to give you a sense of how the individual
[02:30:26.820 --> 02:30:29.900]   behavioral and drug treatments work and perhaps don't work
[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:32.460]   so that you can really make the best informed choices.
[02:30:32.460 --> 02:30:34.580]   Again, highlighting the fact that OCD
[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:36.740]   is an extremely common,
[02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:40.420]   extremely common and yet extremely debilitating condition,
[02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:42.420]   and one that I hope that if any of you have
[02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:43.980]   or that you know people that have it,
[02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:46.920]   that you'll both gain sympathy and understanding
[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:48.140]   for what they're dealing with,
[02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:50.100]   perhaps as a consequence of some of the information
[02:30:50.100 --> 02:30:54.560]   presented today, and maybe help them direct their treatment,
[02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:56.900]   find better treatment, and of course,
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:59.180]   apply those treatments for some relief.

[02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:36.340]   During today's podcast and on many previous episodes
[02:31:36.340 --> 02:31:39.180]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements.
[02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:41.320]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:43.240]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:31:43.240 --> 02:31:46.260]   for things like sleep and focus and anxiety and so on.
[02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:48.120]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:50.900]   with Momentous Supplements because Momentous Supplements
[02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:52.620]   are of the very highest quality.
[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:55.220]   They ship everywhere in the world, not just in the US,
[02:31:55.220 --> 02:31:57.780]   and we wanted to have one location where people could go
[02:31:57.780 --> 02:32:00.220]   in order to access the supplements that we describe
[02:32:00.220 --> 02:32:01.980]   and detail the various roles of
[02:32:01.980 --> 02:32:03.780]   here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:06.020]   If you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
[02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:07.900]   you can find those supplements.
[02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:09.640]   The catalog of supplements available there
[02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:11.620]   is going to be expanding quite a bit in the weeks
[02:32:11.620 --> 02:32:13.340]   and months to come, but right now already,
[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:14.860]   there are a number of different supplements
[02:32:14.860 --> 02:32:17.540]   for enhancing focus, enhancing sleep and so on
[02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:18.380]   that are available.
[02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:21.000]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.860]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[02:32:22.860 --> 02:32:24.740]   on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
[02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:27.340]   There I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:29.180]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:31.420]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast and some of which is distinct
[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:33.500]   from the content on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:35.680]   So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram
