[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.360]   Vaping is actually harder to quit
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.440]   than cigarette smoking for most people.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.080]   Now, does that mean that cigarette smoking
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.460]   is fairly easy to quit for most people?
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.600]   No, 70% of people who smoke cigarettes
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.080]   report that they would like to quit
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.400]   if they thought they could.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.660]   The success rate of quitting smoking
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.680]   when people try to go just cold turkey,
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.440]   just quit with no assistance whatsoever,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.720]   they might tell their family and friends,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.920]   "Hey, I'm quitting, that's it," is exceedingly low.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.920]   It's 5%.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.360]   So 5% of the people that say, "That's it,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.760]   I'm not smoking again, despite cancer diagnosis,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.600]   I'm not smoking again,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200]   despite the fear of the negative health effects,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200]   I'm not going to ever smoke again,
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.600]   despite the financial cost, the health cost."
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.780]   I mean, I could list off a huge number of things
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.640]   that it does that are negative,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.560]   but you already know these or you've heard them.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.520]   It makes your skin worse.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.400]   As I mentioned, it lowers libido, it disrupts hormones,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.160]   it disrupts vascular function, brain function,
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.360]   it does all these terrible things.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.800]   And yet most people who try and quit simply can't.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.480]   And of the 5% that succeed in quitting,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.080]   a full 65% of them relapse within a year.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.400]   So that's a very depressing picture,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.560]   but it's not to say that people cannot quit.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.480]   In fact, they can.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.520]   There are a couple of methods
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.960]   that have been shown to help people quit.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.600]   Some are behavioral and some are pharmacologic.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.940]   I just want to touch on the behavioral ones first,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.360]   because it turns out that there's a quite powerful method
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.280]   for quitting nicotine ingestion by way of cigarette smoking,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   which also carries over to vaping.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.040]   This is beautiful work that's been done by my colleague,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.280]   in fact, close collaborator,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.760]   although I was not involved in the research
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.700]   that I'm about to describe, at Stanford.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.920]   And his name is Dr. David Spiegel.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.100]   He is our Associate Chair of Psychiatry.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.320]   He's been a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.340]   and he is a world expert, if not the world expert,
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.680]   in the clinical applications of hypnosis.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.800]   Now, when I say hypnosis,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.520]   a lot of people think stage hypnosis,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.080]   which is the hypnotist trying to get people
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.460]   to do certain things and say certain things,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.460]   not necessarily against their will,
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.680]   because they actually have to agree,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.540]   but the hypnotist is dictating
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.400]   what the person thinks, says, and does.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   Clinical hypnosis is vastly different from that.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.520]   Clinical hypnosis is where the person, the patient,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.440]   actually directs their own brain changes
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.680]   toward a specific emotional or behavioral goal.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.880]   Work from Dr. David Spiegel's laboratory, done in 1993,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.160]   but that now has been repeated many, many times,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.000]   and it's carried over into some more modern studies,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.460]   and I'll provide links to those studies
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.280]   in the show note caption so that you can access them.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.540]   Those studies have shown
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.440]   that using a specific form of hypnosis,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   people can achieve complete and total cessation
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.240]   of cigarette smoking,
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.300]   and there's no reason to believe
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.620]   this doesn't also carry over to vaping,
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.300]   through one single hypnosis session,
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.920]   and the success rates are incredibly high
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.340]   when one considers that normally
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.820]   it would be only a 5% success rate.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.980]   The success rate with this particular hypnosis
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.820]   developed at Stanford School of Medicine
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.460]   by Dr. David Spiegel is 23% of people
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.140]   who do this hypnosis one time succeed in quitting smoking.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.140]   Now, in the old days, which actually wasn't that long ago,
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.240]   before the advent of smartphones
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.280]   and before the internet took off
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.900]   to the extent that it has now,
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.260]   this was done by having someone come into the clinic
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.860]   and Dr. Spiegel himself or one of his colleagues
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.900]   would take somebody through the hypnosis.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.120]   Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.700]   There's a wonderful app
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.780]   that was developed by Dr. David Spiegel and others.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.360]   It's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.540]   I've talked about this app a few times on the podcast before
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.820]   because there are hypnosis scripts within the app
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.420]   for enhancing sleep, for improving ability to fall asleep
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.020]   if you wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.260]   for focus and a number of other behavioral
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.060]   and emotional changes.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.540]   There's also a function in the Reveri app
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.460]   for smoking cessation, which exactly parallels
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.280]   the sort of in-laboratory and in-clinic approaches
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.500]   that Dr. Spiegel would use
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.980]   were you to show up at his clinic or his laboratory.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.460]   And since that's not possible
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.420]   for the large number of people out there,
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.260]   if you or somebody else is trying to quit smoking
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.680]   or vaping or dipping or snuffing for that matter,
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.380]   I strongly encourage you to check out the Reveri app.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.320]   You can find it easily by going to reveri.com.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.200]   It's available in various formats.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.120]   Some of it is available free, some of it is behind a paywall
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.440]   but given the tremendously negative impact
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.800]   of smoking, vaping, dipping and snuffing,
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.920]   the hypnosis for smoking cessation that Reveri has
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.080]   seems at least to me as a very powerful
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.120]   and worthwhile resource.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.600]   So please check that out if you're somebody
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.400]   who's trying to quit ingesting nicotine
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.160]   by any of the four methods that I just described.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.320]   Now, of course, there are other methods
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.280]   that people have used to successfully quit smoking
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.520]   or vaping or other forms of nicotine delivery.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.920]   And there's actually an excellent review on this topic.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.800]   So before diving into a few of the specifics
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.760]   about some of the pharmacology of using nicotine itself
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.600]   to quit smoking or nicotine itself to quit vaping
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.640]   or the use of various things, even SSRIs, antidepressants
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.880]   to quit smoking or vaping,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.640]   I just want to point you to a review article
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.240]   that if you'd like to get a complete survey
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.160]   of all the options that are available,
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.240]   there's an excellent review on this.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.720]   It was published just a couple of years ago in 2020.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.680]   The title of the article is
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.400]   "Pharmacologic Approach to Smoking Cessation,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.120]   an Updated Review for Daily Clinical Practice."
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.400]   And even though this is mainly focused on smoking cessation,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.920]   it carries over quite nicely to vaping.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.600]   And it details a number of statistics.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.200]   You know, the fact that every year,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.000]   700,000 or more people die
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.480]   because of smoking-related diseases.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.520]   So there again, you have the negative health effects
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.880]   that younger people are smoking,
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.480]   that women are smoking more nowadays,
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.920]   and that even though you see less smoking
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.520]   typically in the U.S. and Canada
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.440]   and even in Northern Europe, some places,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.960]   there's still many, many people are smoking
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.240]   who would like to quit.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.360]   But that 75% of people,
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.640]   at least according to this review earlier,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.200]   I said 70%, but estimates are as high as 75% of people
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.280]   who try to quit smoking relapse within the first week.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.800]   The first week, they just go right back to it.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.320]   That's how powerfully reinforcing the nicotine is.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.240]   Remember, it's the nicotine in the cigarette
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.440]   that's powerfully reinforcing,
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.440]   but it's also the oral habit, the motor habit.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.560]   You know, there is this thing
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.760]   about density of sensory receptors in the lips.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.100]   People like bringing things to their lips.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.000]   Food, cigarettes, other lips in some cases, et cetera.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.520]   There is a reinforcement pathway related to that
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.980]   for sort of obvious adaptive reasons.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.480]   And as a consequence,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.120]   there is a reinforcement both from the behavior
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.680]   and from the dopamine released from the nicotine itself.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.080]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.240]   from the positive reinforcement
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.440]   that comes from increased focus,
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.800]   so the money that you make through work
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.200]   or your attentional ability
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.160]   or the fact that you're alert and people feel you present,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.440]   all of that funnels back into positive reinforcement,
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.320]   behavioral reinforcement,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.800]   and then what we would call addiction.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.080]   So this review covers all of that
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.780]   and then steps beautifully
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.320]   through nicotine replacement therapy and various compounds,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.280]   several of which I'm going to talk about now,
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.520]   which have been shown to increase that number
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.160]   that we talked about earlier of only 5% of people
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.640]   who try to quit with no other support,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.400]   pharmacologic or hypnosis or otherwise,
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.560]   just say, that's it, I'm not going to smoke again
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.200]   or I'm not going to vape again.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.440]   Only 5% of people succeed in doing that.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.280]   And even among those, many end up relapsing later.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.400]   There are a couple of pharmacologic approaches.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.320]   One of the main ones that's received a lot of attention
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.600]   in recent years is bupripurone,
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   sometimes referred to by its commercial name, Wellbutrin.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.360]   Now, bupripurone is a compound
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.560]   that increases the release of dopamine
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.440]   and to a lesser extent, epinephrine
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.140]   and some other neurochemicals as well.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.160]   It's used for the treatment of depression
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.260]   and for smoking cessation.
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.440]   Now, I want to point out, again, I'm not a psychiatrist,
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.000]   so I'm not telling you to take bupripurone aka Wellbutrin,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.720]   but I'm going to give you a little bit of the contour
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.160]   of what's typically done
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.000]   in terms of bupripurone administration
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.920]   to help people get relief
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.780]   from some of the withdrawal symptoms
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.440]   of trying to quit smoking or vaping
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.080]   or other forms of nicotine ingestion.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.360]   Typically, bupripurone is taken
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.000]   in 300 milligram per day doses
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.720]   divided into two dosages of 150 milligrams each,
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.760]   or sometimes there's a slow release formula.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.440]   The dosages will vary from person to person.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.940]   I want to really emphasize
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.200]   that there is an increased seizure risk with bupripurone.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.480]   It only occurs in a small fraction of the population,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.520]   but nonetheless is a real concern
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.920]   for those members of the population.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.760]   So for those of you with seizure risk,
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.160]   whether you know it or not,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.680]   that's going to be a valid concern
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.500]   in terms of potential side effects.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.160]   The other thing about bupripurone
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.440]   is that it has to be used with caution in patients
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.400]   that have liver disease or renal disease
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.960]   that can impact the amount that anyone can take,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.200]   meaning sometimes people have to take a much lower dose
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.760]   if they have renal disease or liver disease,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.440]   and sometimes they can't take it at all.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.800]   Sometimes if people are taking benzodiazepines
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.720]   for whatever reason or other sedatives,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.280]   there are contraindications there.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.920]   So bupripurone isn't a kind of one-size-fits-all
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.020]   or magic bullet for quitting smoking.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.600]   Nonetheless, for people that can take it safely,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.400]   and again, this is a prescription drug,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.720]   a board-certified psychiatrist or other physician
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.120]   is going to have to prescribe it for you
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.200]   if it's appropriate for you,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.000]   and it moves that number of 5% success rate
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.040]   to about what one sees with the clinical hypnosis
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.600]   to about 20% of people will successfully
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.320]   overcome their nicotine,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.800]   or I should say their smoking or vaping addiction.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.620]   Now, it's important to ask why this would work, right?
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.720]   I mean, it's not as if bupripurone
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.760]   is increasing nicotine per se.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.120]   What it's doing is it's tapping
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.880]   on that mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.320]   increasing dopamine, or at least allowing dopamine levels
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.100]   to stay substantially elevated enough
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.440]   that people don't experience some of the drop in dopamine
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.920]   that leads to the withdrawal symptoms,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.440]   the lessening of mood, et cetera.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.120]   And it's no coincidence that bupripurone
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.940]   is also an antidepressant.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.880]   It's a common antidepressant for people
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.280]   that experience negative side effects
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.840]   with the so-called SSRIs,
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.400]   the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors,
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.920]   that prevent them from taking those things
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.720]   like lessened libido or appetite,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.840]   or in some cases, increased appetite,
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.320]   or any number of other side effects
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.560]   that some people, not all,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.280]   but some people experience with SSRIs.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.200]   They'll be prescribed Welbutrin, bupripurone
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.720]   is the generic name,
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.440]   so Welbutrin being the commercial name.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.700]   Again, bupripurone is what they'll be prescribed instead.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.980]   With the caveats of seizure risk,
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.420]   renal disease, liver disease, et cetera,
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.940]   the outcomes with Welbutrin for smoking cessation
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.780]   are pretty good.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.460]   I mean, if you think about an increase from 5% to 20%,
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.620]   that's pretty dramatic.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.340]   And yet, I also want to refer back
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.620]   to the incredible success of the clinical hypnosis approach.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.220]   Again, you can find that at reverie.com.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.340]   The clinical hypnosis approach has a success rate of 23%,
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.300]   so it's very closely aligned with,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.920]   if not exceeding, the success rate with bupripurone.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.080]   Of course, there are other pharmacologic approaches
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.120]   to quitting smoking or vaping.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.560]   All of them generally circle back to increasing dopamine
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.920]   and/or norepinephrine
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.560]   in order to offset some of the withdrawal symptoms
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.240]   of smoking cessation or vaping cessation.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.280]   A very common approach for people
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.400]   to try and quit smoking or vaping
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   is to use nicotine itself
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.360]   to try and prevent people from seeking nicotine
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.800]   through a cigarette or a vape pen.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.760]   What I mean by that is people using a nicotine patch
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.600]   or nicotine gum or other nicotine delivery device
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.520]   that is not cigarettes and not vaping
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.520]   in order to maintain levels of nicotine in their bloodstream,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.780]   which of course means maintain levels of nicotine
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.720]   in their brain and body,
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.600]   to the same extent that they would
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.560]   if they were smoking or vaping,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.920]   maybe even gradually taking down the total amount
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.680]   of nicotine in their brain and body
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.480]   by reducing the number or size of nicotine gum pieces
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.920]   that they ingest each day,
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.540]   or keeping the patch on for a shorter amount of time,
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.880]   or getting a lower dose patch
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.840]   that releases less nicotine total or over time.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.720]   All of those approaches have been shown
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.640]   to be reasonably successful.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.700]   I'll get to the numbers in a few minutes,
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.360]   but reasonably successful
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.360]   in allowing people to quit smoking or vaping.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.280]   Again, most of the data is on cigarette smoking
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.740]   because vaping is a relatively new phenomenon,
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.000]   although quite troublingly,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.340]   it's a very rapidly increasing behavior,
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.840]   especially in the young population.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.960]   So that's why I'm kind of lumping these two things together
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   because I think very soon we are going to need
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.100]   an all-out campaign for how to counter vaping addiction.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.440]   So what do we know about smoking sensation
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.080]   using nicotine itself?
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.320]   Is the patch best?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.040]   Is nicotine gum best?
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.060]   It turns out that a combination of approaches is best.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.160]   So somewhat surprising,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.360]   but it was very clear from the literature
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.720]   that I was able to find that using nicotine patches
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.760]   for some period of time, and then switching to a gum,
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.680]   and then perhaps switching to a nasal spray,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.480]   that's going to be the most effective.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.640]   Then the question is how long to continue each of those
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.120]   and whether or not to overlap them.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.640]   It seems as if doing one for about a week
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.240]   and then switching to another for about a week
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.560]   and then switching to another
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.320]   is one rational and reasonable approach
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.700]   that many people have used successfully.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.540]   Why would that be?
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.240]   Well, it all has to do with the different rates
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.040]   of absorption of nicotine into the bloodstream,
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.280]   and then the downstream consequences of that
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.960]   on the dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine,
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.120]   and other systems of the brain and body.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.480]   And while there hasn't been an extremely detailed study
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.400]   of the exact kinetics of how the nasal sprays
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.760]   versus the transdermal patches
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.600]   versus the gums, et cetera, work,
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.060]   there's a logical structure to it
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.400]   that will immediately make sense to you.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.840]   First of all, the transdermal patches
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.680]   provide a fairly steady state dopamine release
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.920]   across the day,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.280]   and oftentimes people are wearing them at night as well.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.360]   This is relevant because if people are ingesting nicotine
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.580]   by way of smoking and vaping,
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.920]   you know, hopefully they're not waking up
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.320]   in the middle of the night just to smoke or vape,
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.720]   or believe it or not, some people do that.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.920]   But of course, while people are asleep,
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.040]   they are not smoking or vaping.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.000]   They always tell you don't fall asleep
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.820]   with a cigarette in your mouth,
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.840]   you burn the whole house down.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.000]   But exceedingly rare to have people
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.540]   who are smoking in their sleep.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.120]   So people wake up in the morning,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.280]   and because the half-life of nicotine
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.640]   from smoking or vaping is very short,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.560]   anywhere from one to two hours,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.160]   they are essentially in a state of withdrawal
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.520]   at the point where they wake up in the morning.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.360]   How can I say that?
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.960]   Well, remember, withdrawal sets in about four hours
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.720]   after the last ingestion of nicotine by cigarette
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.600]   or by inhalation from the vape pen.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.280]   So people are waking up in nicotine withdrawal,
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.560]   and then immediately going into the behavior
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.600]   of ingesting nicotine or very soon after waking
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.160]   for most people.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.120]   So nicotine patch is going to be very effective
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.160]   for a week or so.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160]   Again, talk to your physician
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.000]   about the best approach for this.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.440]   But then switching to a nasal spray
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.680]   or switching to nicotine gum for about a week,
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.160]   which is going to change the kinetics
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.240]   of that nicotine absorption to the bloodstream
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.680]   and change the release of dopamine
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.320]   and other neurochemicals within the brain,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.760]   that's going to keep the system intentionally off balance
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.400]   so that it never comes to expect one single pattern
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.560]   or amplitude of dopamine release.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.200]   And that is a very powerful way for a,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.240]   let's just call it a quitting method to work
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.880]   because as I've always said,
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.800]   the most powerful schedule of dopamine
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.680]   is going to be this random intermittent reward.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.400]   This is what's used in the casinos
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.640]   in order to take your money.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.300]   And generally they do, on average,
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.840]   they take your money more than you take theirs,
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.880]   and they take more of it, not just more often,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.360]   because they use this random intermittent schedule.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.760]   The random intermittent schedule
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.400]   is one in which you don't really know
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.840]   when the peaks in dopamine are going to arrive.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.320]   And so there isn't this expectation and craving.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.040]   And then all of a sudden when dopamine is released,
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.920]   it's extremely high.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.300]   That's how they get you to continue playing,
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.880]   even though basically you're losing money
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   and your dopamine is dropping,
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.760]   they elevate it every once in a while.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.280]   Nicotine replacement can be used in a similar way,
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.280]   but in a benevolent way in order to help you get over
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.800]   smoking or vaping.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.600]   By keeping the total amounts of dopamine variable
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.280]   around the clock,
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.120]   and by changing the amount of dopamine that's released,
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.520]   it seems to help people behaviorally and psychologically
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.940]   because they don't come to expect
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.460]   having a particular amount of dopamine
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.560]   in their brain and blood at any given time.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.120]   (upbeat music)
