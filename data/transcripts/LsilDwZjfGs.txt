[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.480]   - What can I do to ensure that my life counts?
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.960]   To ensure that the life that God has given to me matters?
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.040]   That is a significant question, it's a universal question,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.560]   and one asked of John Piper on June 3rd of this year
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.640]   in Monticevano, Italy.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.160]   It came in the context of a television interview,
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.800]   and what follows is a field recording
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.880]   of what John Piper said, and answering the question,
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.200]   what is the true significance of life,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.120]   and how is this related to risk-taking?
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.120]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.120]   - The true significance of life
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   is that God made human beings in his own image
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.680]   with precious value, and that value, that significance,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.520]   consists in knowing God, loving God, showing God.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.240]   In other words, life is about God.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.720]   Man is not central, God is central.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.720]   He created the universe and humanity
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.360]   in order to magnify the greatness of God,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.360]   and our joy in this world, which God made essential,
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.360]   is in Jesus Christ, in God the Father, in the Holy Spirit,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.600]   so there's no tension between finding our significance
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.520]   in making much of God and being as happy as we can be.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.880]   This is one of the greatest discoveries of my life,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.640]   that God's purpose to be glorified
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.440]   and my passion to be satisfied are not at odds.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.280]   They come together in finding my satisfaction in God,
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.280]   so I use the little phrase, God is most glorified in me
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.680]   when I am most satisfied in him,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.960]   so he gets the glory, I get the joy.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.760]   Now, the second part of your question about risk
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.240]   and taking chances is that people who find
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.920]   their fullest joy and satisfaction in God
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.840]   that can never be taken away,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.120]   not even death can take it away,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.600]   in God's presence, his fullness of joy,
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.000]   at his right hand are pleasures forever, forever,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.800]   so death cannot stop my joy.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.480]   Those kind of people are the most risky,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   dangerous, in the good sense, they love others at any cost,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.920]   so if I see that you are in trouble, that you are dying,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.640]   which I think everybody is dying
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.600]   and perishing without Christ,
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.360]   I'm willing to lay down my life for you
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.600]   because death doesn't take away my joy
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.240]   and if you would believe in Christ,
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.920]   then my joy is doubled because I find my joy
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   in your joy in God, so I think it's the best of all worlds.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.280]   God gets the glory, I get joy, and you get loved.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.040]   - The follow-up question came next,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.560]   so what then is the wasted life?
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.720]   Here's what Piper said.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   - We waste our lives if we seek our happiness
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.240]   and our significance without reference to Jesus Christ.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.200]   If God is left out of the picture,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.760]   if Christ is taken out of the picture
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.200]   and we become a millionaire,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.760]   have all the sexual pleasures we can imagine,
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   become very famous, we've wasted our lives
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   because in the end, God is the one who created the world
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.160]   and God is bringing the world and everything in it
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.640]   to an end for his purposes
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.320]   and if we haven't joined him in those purposes,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.400]   we're wasting our lives.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.480]   You waste your life if you don't do
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.080]   what you were designed to do
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.160]   and every human being created in the image of God
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.360]   was designed to reflect the glory of God,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   the worth of God, the beauty of God.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   So if we don't find our joy in Christ,
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.360]   if we don't find our satisfaction in Christ,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.600]   but instead find it in other things
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.880]   that may in the short run look very satisfying,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.840]   we have wasted our lives,
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.600]   which means most of the world is wasting its life
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.520]   because they don't know God, they don't love God.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.960]   God is a very small, marginal consideration
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.160]   out on the edge of life,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.960]   maybe every now and then he's brought into life in a crisis,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.720]   well, that's a great blasphemy,
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.480]   that's a great dishonor to God
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.400]   and we will find at the end of our lives,
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.040]   we've wasted it if we've treated God
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.600]   as marginal instead of central.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.480]   - That's so good.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.400]   This was a field recording captured
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.200]   during John Piper's television interview
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.840]   in Monticevano, Italy, recorded on June 3rd of this year
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.960]   during his recent international trip.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.120]   John Piper was there for the Italian Ministries
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.720]   Congresso Missione 2016 conference
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.520]   and he was interviewed by Alessandro Iovino.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.640]   Little clips like this one remind us
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.320]   of the vast reach of the web
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.000]   and of Desiring God content around the world.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.720]   Our internet distribution strategy
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.160]   allows people from all the nations
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.640]   to access our content and mobile apps free of charge.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.000]   Desiring God in this podcast is supported almost entirely
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.800]   by the generosity of our donors around the world
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.920]   who make this international work possible, so thank you.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.720]   For your generosity.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   Well, suffering is never very far away
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.600]   from any of our lives and tomorrow a listener
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   wants John Piper's thoughts on the recent story
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.840]   in the news of Jerica Bolin in Appleton, Wisconsin.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.860]   She is a 14-year-old girl with a terminal illness
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.760]   who has decided that her life should come to a swift end.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.600]   That is tomorrow.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.560]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.520]   with longtime author and theologian and pastor,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.280]   John Piper, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.440]   (upbeat music)
