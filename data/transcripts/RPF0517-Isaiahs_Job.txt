[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   Today on Radical Personal Finance I have a unique show for you, very much out of the
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.160]   ordinary for Radical Personal Finance and yet I believe very practical and applicable.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.240]   Today I'm going to read to you an essay to which I have alluded at various times in Radical
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.860]   Personal Finance history called Isaiah's Job.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.820]   This essay was first published in the year 1936 in the Atlantic Monthly and is written
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.840]   by a man named Albert J. Nock.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.440]   In essence, it's about the value of not trying to seek the masses.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.620]   This essay has been very influential for me personally, very encouraging at different
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.940]   times and I believe has broad application to you and to your life.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.700]   It is not an essay that will specifically tell you how to get rich.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.140]   In fact, it may be the exact opposite.
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.980]   It will tell you why you shouldn't worry about getting rich with your message.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.740]   But it is something that I have found to be very stimulating and very helpful.
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.680]   I'd like to provide more commentary but I may do that elsewhere.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.860]   As with many good works of literature, I think it's best to let this particular essay stand
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.100]   on its own two feet and let you draw your own meaning and conclusions from this.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.260]   The essay that I'm about to read for you will be deeply philosophical and probably
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.500]   challenging to you.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.020]   But I would encourage you not to turn it off but to embrace the challenge.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.540]   If anything, this should be a point of inspiration to recognize that this essay was not written
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.540]   to an academic audience.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.420]   It was not written in academic ease, the weird language that is totally unintelligible to
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.120]   those of us who are not involved in academics.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.460]   This was written as what would be termed a popular essay to be published in a popular
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.260]   magazine.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.420]   And yet you'll find that the literary quality will be challenging for you.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.780]   But stick with it.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.380]   The first page or two is a little bit slow to start but the ideas here are very, very
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.580]   powerful.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.100]   So give it a shot and see if you don't find these ideas to be helpful, influential, and
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.380]   thought-provoking for you.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.420]   This essay has been very, very useful for me in my life over the past years.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:31.300]   Isaiah's Job by Albert J. Nock, first published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1936.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.100]   One evening last autumn, I sat long hours with a European acquaintance while he expounded
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.420]   a political-economic doctrine which seemed sound as a nut and in which I could find no
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.080]   defect.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.660]   At the end, he said with great earnestness, "I have a mission to the masses.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.900]   I feel that I am called to get the ear of the people.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.840]   I shall devote the rest of my life to spreading my doctrine far and wide among the population.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.800]   What do you think?"
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.820]   An embarrassing question in any case and doubly so under the circumstances because my acquaintance
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.060]   is a very learned man, one of the three or four really first-class minds that Europe
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.040]   produced in his generation.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.980]   And naturally, I, as one of the unlearned, was inclined to regard his lightest word with
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.540]   reverence amounting to awe.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.340]   Still, I reflected, even the greatest mind cannot possibly know everything and I was
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.060]   pretty sure that he had not had my opportunities for observing the masses of mankind and that
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.660]   therefore I probably knew them better than he did.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.340]   So I mustered courage to say that he had no such mission and would do well to get the
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.540]   idea out of his head at once.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.020]   He would find that the masses would not care two pins for his doctrine, and still less
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:56.500]   for himself, since in such circumstances the popular favorite is generally some Barabbas.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.380]   I even went so far as to say, he is a Jew, that his idea seemed to show that he was not
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.340]   very well up on his own native literature.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.660]   He smiled at my jest and asked what I meant by it, and I referred him to the story of
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.580]   the prophet Isaiah.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.060]   It occurred to me then that this story is much worth recalling just now, when so many
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.980]   wise men and soothsayers appear to be burdened with a message to the masses.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.780]   Dr. Townsend has a message.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.780]   Father Coughlin has one.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.740]   Mr. Upton Sinclair.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.020]   Mr. Lippman.
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.140]   Mr. Chase and the Planned Economy Brethren.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.500]   Mr. Tugwell and the New Dealers.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.100]   Mr. Smith and Liberty Leaguers.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.860]   The list is endless.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.380]   I cannot remember a time when so many energumens were so variously proclaiming the word to
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.300]   the multitude and telling them what they must do to be saved.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.340]   This being so, it occurred to me, as I say, that the story of Isaiah might have something
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.060]   in it to steady and compose the human spirit until this tyranny of windiness is overpassed.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.340]   I shall paraphrase the story in our common speech, since it has to be pieced out from
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.300]   various sources, and inasmuch as respectable scholars have thought fit to put out a whole
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.140]   new version of the Bible in the American vernacular, I shall take shelter behind them, if need
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.060]   be, against the charge of dealing irreverently with the sacred scriptures.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.140]   The prophet's career began at the end of King Uzziah's reign, say, about 740 BC.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.420]   This reign was uncommonly long, almost half a century, and apparently prosperous.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:52.140]   It was one of those prosperous reigns, however, like the reign of Marcus Aurelius at Rome,
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:59.060]   or the administration of Ubulus at Athens, or of Mr. Coolidge at Washington, where at
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.740]   the end, the prosperity suddenly peters out and things go by the board with a resounding
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.240]   crash.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.900]   In the year of Uzziah's death, the Lord commissioned the prophet to go out and warn the people
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.380]   of the wrath to come.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.580]   "Tell them what a worthless lot they are," he said.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.180]   "Tell them what is wrong and why and what is going to happen unless they have a change
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.140]   of heart and straighten up.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.660]   Don't mince matters.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.060]   Make it clear that they are positively down to their last chance.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.260]   Give it to them good and strong and keep on giving it to them.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.740]   I suppose I perhaps I ought to tell you," he added, "that it won't do any good.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.240]   The official class and their intelligentsia will turn up their noses at you and the masses
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.940]   will not even listen.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.980]   They will all keep on in their own ways until they carry everything down to destruction,
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.380]   and you will probably be lucky if you get out with your life."
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.020]   Isaiah had been very willing to take on the job.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.260]   In fact, he had asked for it.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.680]   But the prospect put a new face on the situation.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.340]   It raised the obvious question.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.220]   Why, if all that were so, if the enterprise were to be a failure from the start, was there
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.580]   any sense in starting it?
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.660]   "Ah," the Lord said, "you do not get the point.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.260]   There is a remnant there that you know nothing about.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:29.180]   They are obscure, unorganized, inarticulate, each one rubbing along as best he can.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.540]   They need to be encouraged and braced up, because when everything has gone completely
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.820]   to the dogs, they are the ones who will come back and build up a new society.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.300]   And meanwhile, your preaching will reassure them and keep them hanging on.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.620]   Your job is to take care of the remnant.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.820]   So be off now and set about it."
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.500]   Apparently, then, if the Lord's word is good for anything, I do not offer any opinion
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:03.660]   about that, the only element in Judean society that was particularly worth bothering about
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.180]   was the remnant.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.420]   Isaiah seems, finally, to have got it through his head that this was the case, that nothing
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.380]   was to be expected from the masses, but that if anything substantial were ever to be done
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.140]   in Judea, the remnant would have to do it.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.860]   This is a very striking and suggestive idea, but before going on to explore it, we need
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.020]   to be quite clear about our terms.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:36.000]   What do we mean by "the masses" and what by "the remnant"?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.980]   As the word "masses" is commonly used, it suggests agglomerations of poor and underprivileged
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.940]   people, laboring people, proletarians, and it means nothing like that.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.820]   It means simply the majority.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:59.460]   The mass man is one who has neither the force of intellect to apprehend the principles issuing
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:05.020]   in what we know as the humane life, nor the force of character to adhere to those principles
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.940]   steadily and strictly as laws of conduct.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.560]   And because such people make up the great and overwhelming majority of mankind, they
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.740]   are called collectively "the masses."
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.460]   The line of differentiation between "the masses" and "the remnant" is set invariably
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.820]   by quality, not by circumstance.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:34.380]   The remnant are those who, by force of intellect, are able to apprehend these principles and
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:40.420]   by force of character are able, at least measurably, to cleave to them.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.560]   The masses are those who are unable to do either.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.580]   The picture which Isaiah presents of the Judean masses is most unfavorable.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:57.140]   In his view, the mass man, be he high or be he lowly, rich or poor, prince or pauper,
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.520]   gets off very badly.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:07.780]   He appears as not only weak-minded and weak-willed, but as by consequence, knavish, arrogant,
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:13.620]   grasping, dissipated, unprincipled, unscrupulous.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:19.460]   The mass woman also gets off badly as sharing all the mass man's untoward qualities and
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:26.140]   contributing a few of her own in the way of vanity and laziness, extravagance and foible.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.740]   The list of luxury products that she patronized is interesting.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.540]   It calls to mind the women's page of a Sunday newspaper in 1928 or the display set forth
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.180]   in one of our professedly "smart" periodicals.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.980]   In another place, Isaiah even recalls the affectations that we used to know by the name
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.340]   "flappergate" and the "debutante slouch."
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:56.060]   It may be fair to discount Isaiah's vivacity a little for prophetic fervor.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:02.680]   After all, since his real job was not to convert the masses but to brace and reassure the remnant,
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.980]   he probably felt that he might lay it on indiscriminately and as thick as he liked.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.780]   In fact, that he was expected to do so.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:17.100]   But even so, the Judean mass man must have been a most objectionable individual and the
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.860]   mass woman utterly odious.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:26.420]   If the modern spirit, whatever that may be, is disinclined towards taking the Lord's
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:31.900]   word at its face value, as I hear is the case, we may observe that Isaiah's testimony to
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:38.140]   the character of the masses has strong collateral support from respectable Gentile authority.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:44.340]   Plato lived into the administration of Ubulus when Athens was at the peak of its "jazz
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:50.700]   and paper" era, and he speaks of the Athenian masses with all Isaiah's fervency, even
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.900]   comparing them to a herd of ravenous wild beasts.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:01.560]   Curiously, too, he applies Isaiah's own word, "remnant," to the worthier portion
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.340]   of Athenian society.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.900]   "There is but a very small remnant," he says, "of those who possess a saving force
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:16.860]   of intellect and force of character, too small, preciously as to Judea, to be of any avail
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:22.560]   against the ignorant and vicious preponderance of the masses."
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:30.760]   But Isaiah was a preacher and Plato a philosopher, and we tend to regard preachers and philosophers
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:37.580]   rather as passive observers of the drama of life than as active participants.
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:43.980]   Hence, in a matter of this kind, their judgment might be suspected of being a little uncompromising,
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:49.120]   a little acrid, or as the French say, "s'engrenou."
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.860]   We may therefore bring forward another witness who was preeminently a man of affairs and
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.760]   whose judgment cannot lie under this suspicion.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:04.320]   Marcus Aurelius was a ruler of the greatest of empires, and in that capacity he not only
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:11.020]   had the Roman mass man under observation, but he had him on his hands twenty-four hours
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.260]   a day for eighteen years.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:21.420]   What he did not know about him was not worth knowing, and what he thought of him is abundantly
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.180]   attested on almost every page of the little book of jottings which he scribbled offhand
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:32.700]   from day to day and which he meant for no eye but his own ever to see.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.460]   This view of the masses is the one that we find prevailing at large among the ancient
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.740]   authorities whose writings have come down to us.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.220]   In the eighteenth century, however, certain European philosophers spread the notion that
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:50.760]   the mass man in his natural state is not at all the kind of person that earlier authorities
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.380]   made him out to be, but on the contrary that he is a worthy object of interest.
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:06.660]   His untowardness is the effect of environment, an effect for which society is somehow responsible.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:13.540]   If only his environment permitted him to live according to his lights, he would undoubtedly
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.520]   show himself to be quite a fellow, and the best way to secure a more favorable environment
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.660]   for him would be to let him arrange it for himself.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.500]   The French Revolution acted powerfully as a springboard for this idea, projecting its
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.960]   influence in all directions throughout Europe.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.260]   On this side of the ocean, a whole new continent stood ready for a large-scale experiment with
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.780]   this theory.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.700]   It afforded every conceivable resource whereby the masses might develop a civilization made
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.580]   in their own likeness and after their own image.
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.420]   There was no force of tradition to disturb them in their preponderance or to check them
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.980]   in a thoroughgoing disparagement of the remnant.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:01.940]   Immense natural wealth, unquestioned predominance, virtual isolation, freedom from external interference
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.620]   and the fear of it, and finally a century and a half of time.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.880]   Such are the advantages which the mass man has had in bringing forth a civilization which
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:18.060]   should set the earlier preachers and philosophers at naught in their belief that nothing substantial
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.400]   can be expected from the masses, but only from the remnant.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.980]   His success is unimpressive.
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.940]   From the evidence so far presented, one must say, I think, that the mass man's conception
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:39.140]   of what life has to offer and his choice of what to ask from life seems now to be pretty
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:45.340]   well what they were in the times of Isaiah and Plato, and so too seem the catastrophic
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.440]   social conflicts and convulsions in which his views of life and his demands on life
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.300]   involve him.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:59.020]   I do not wish to dwell on this, however, but merely to observe that the monstrously inflated
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:04.820]   importance of the masses has apparently put all thought of a possible mission to the remnant
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.540]   out of the modern prophet's head.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.940]   This is obviously quite as it should be, provided that the earlier preachers and philosophers
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.420]   were actually wrong and that all final hope of the human race is actually centered in
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.660]   the masses.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:25.780]   If, on the other hand, it should turn out that the Lord and Isaiah and Plato and Marcus
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.500]   Aurelius were right in their estimate of the relative social value of the masses and the
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.380]   remnant, the case is somewhat different.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:41.360]   Moreover, since with everything in their favor the masses have so far given such an extremely
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.420]   discouraging account of themselves, it would seem that the question at issue between these
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:53.700]   two bodies of opinion might most profitably be reopened.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:17:00.460]   But without following up this suggestion, I wish only, as I said, to remark the fact
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:08.140]   that as things now stand, Isaiah's job seems rather to go begging.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:14.440]   Everyone with a message nowadays is, like my venerable European friend, eager to take
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.780]   it to the masses.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:24.000]   His first, last, and only thought is of mass acceptance and mass approval.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.140]   His great care is to put his doctrine in such shape as will capture the masses' attention
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.740]   and interest.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:38.380]   This attitude towards the masses is so exclusive, so devout, that one is reminded of the troglodytic
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:44.340]   monster described by Plato and the assiduous crowd at the entrance to its cave trying,
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:50.620]   persequiously, to placate it and win its favor, trying to interpret its inarticulate noises,
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.260]   trying to find out what it wants, and eagerly offering it all sorts of things that they
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.380]   think might strike its fancy.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:04.980]   The main trouble with all this is its reaction upon the mission itself.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:12.820]   It necessitates an opportunistic sophistication of one's doctrine, which profoundly alters
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.860]   its character and reduces it to a mere placebo.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:23.060]   If you are a preacher, you wish to attract as large a congregation as you can, which
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.780]   means an appeal to the masses.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.820]   This in turn means adapting the terms of your message to the order of intellect and character
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.380]   that the masses exhibit.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.660]   If you are an educator, say with a college on your hands, you wish to get as many students
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.700]   as possible, and you whittle down your requirements accordingly.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.700]   If a writer, you aim at getting many readers.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.660]   If a publisher, many purchasers.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.100]   If a philosopher, many disciples.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.060]   If a reformer, many converts.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.460]   If a musician, many auditors, and so on.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.580]   But as we see on all sides, in the realization of these several desires, the prophetic message
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:11.220]   is so heavily adulterated with trivialities in every instance that its effect on the masses
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.220]   is merely to harden them in their sins.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:21.340]   Meanwhile, the remnant, aware of this adulteration and of the desires that prompt it, turn their
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.940]   backs on the prophet and will have nothing to do with him or his message.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:31.020]   Isaiah, on the other hand, worked under no such disabilities.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:36.340]   He preached to the masses only in the sense that he preached publicly.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.380]   Anyone who liked might listen.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.820]   Anyone who liked might pass by.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.960]   He knew that the remnant would listen.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.420]   And knowing also that nothing was to be expected of the masses under any circumstances, he
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:55.020]   made no specific appeal to them, did not accommodate his message to their measure in any way, and
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.100]   did not care two straws whether they heeded it or not.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:07.660]   As a modern publisher might put it, he was not worrying about circulation or about advertising.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:13.260]   Hence, with all such obsessions quite out of the way, he was in a position to do his
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:21.700]   level best without fear or favor and answerable only to his august boss.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:27.420]   If a prophet were not too particular about making money out of his mission or getting
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:32.380]   a dubious sort of notoriety out of it, the foregoing considerations would lead one to
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.100]   say that serving the remnant looks like a good job.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.660]   An assignment that you can really put your back into and do your best without thinking
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:49.060]   about results is a real job, whereas serving the masses is, at best, only half a job, considering
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:54.460]   the inexorable conditions that the masses impose upon their servants.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.520]   They ask you to give them what they want.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.820]   They insist upon it and will take nothing else, and following their whims, their irrational
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.180]   changes of fancy, their hot and cold fits is a tedious business.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.500]   To say nothing of the fact that what they want at any time makes very little call on
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.380]   one's resources of prophecy.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:25.660]   The remnant, on the other hand, want only the best you have, whatever that may be.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.820]   Give them that and they are satisfied.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.440]   You have nothing more to worry about.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.300]   The prophet of the American masses must aim consciously at the lowest common denominator
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:44.220]   of intellect, taste, and character among 120 million people, and this is a distressing
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.720]   task.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.660]   The prophet of the remnant, on the contrary, is in the enviable position of Papa Haydn
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.780]   in the household of Prince Esterházy.
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.940]   All Haydn had to do was keep forking out the very best music he knew how to produce, knowing
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:08.180]   it would be understood and appreciated by those for whom he produced it, and carrying
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:16.720]   not a button what anyone else thought of it, and that makes a good job.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.660]   In a sense, nevertheless, as I have said, it is not a rewarding job.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:28.640]   If you can touch the fancy of the masses and have the sagacity to keep always one jump
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.240]   ahead of their vagaries and vacillations, you can get good returns in money from serving
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:42.560]   the masses and good returns also in a mouth-to-ear type of notoriety.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.040]   Digito mostrare et dicere, iqu'est.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:54.160]   We all know innumerable politicians, journalists, dramatists, novelists, and the like who have
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.080]   done extremely well by themselves in these ways.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:05.520]   Taking care of the remnant, on the contrary, holds little promise of any such rewards.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   A prophet of the remnant will not grow purse-proud on the financial returns from his work, nor
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.000]   is it likely that he will get any great renown out of it.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.840]   Isaiah's case was exceptional to this second rule, and there are others, but not many.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.760]   It may be thought, then, that while taking care of the remnant is no doubt a good job,
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:37.020]   it is not an especially interesting job because it is, as a rule, so poorly paid.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.360]   I have my doubts about this.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:46.680]   There are other compensations to be got out of a job besides money and notoriety, and
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.260]   some of them seem substantial enough to be attractive.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:57.200]   Many jobs which do not pay well are yet profoundly interesting, as, for instance, the job of
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.520]   research students in the sciences is said to be, and the job of looking after the remnant
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.580]   seems to me, as I have surveyed it for many years from my seat in the grandstand, to be
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.920]   as interesting as any that can be found in the world.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:18.760]   What chiefly makes it so, I think, is that in any given society the remnant are always
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.040]   so largely an unknown quantity.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:28.020]   You do not know and will never know more than two things about them.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.700]   You can be sure of those, dead sure, as our phrase is, but you will never be able to make
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.880]   even a respectable guess at anything else.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:47.000]   You do not know and will never know who the remnant are, nor what they are doing or will
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.500]   do.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.980]   Two things you do know and know more.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.300]   First, that they exist.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:00.320]   Second, that they will find you.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:07.080]   Except for these two certainties, working for the remnant means working in impenetrable
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:14.020]   darkness, and this, I should say, is just the condition calculated most effectively
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:20.580]   to pique the interest of any prophet who is properly gifted with the imagination, insight,
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:28.020]   and intellectual curiosity necessary to a successful pursuit of his trade.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:36.240]   The fascination and the despair of the historian as he looks back upon Isaiah's Jewry, upon
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:44.000]   Plato's Athens, or upon Rome of the Antonines, is the hope of discovering and laying bare
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.060]   the substratum of right thinking and well-doing, which he knows must have existed somewhere
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:56.140]   in those societies, because no kind of collective life can possibly go on without it.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:02.060]   He finds tantalizing intimations of it here and there in many places, as in the Greek
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:07.900]   Anthology, in the scrapbook of Aulus Gellius, in the poems of Osonius, and in the brief
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:14.720]   and touching tribute Bene Merenti bestowed upon the unknown occupants of Roman tombs.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.540]   But these are vague and fragmentary.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:24.540]   They lead him nowhere in his search for some kind of measure on this substratum, but merely
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:32.260]   testify to what he already knew a priori—that the substratum did somewhere exist.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:38.740]   Where it was, how substantial it was, what its power of self-assertion and resistance
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.740]   was—of all this they tell him nothing.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:48.540]   Similarly, when the historian of two thousand years hence, or two hundred years, looks over
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.300]   the available testimony to the quality of our civilization and tries to get any kind
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.600]   of clear, competent evidence concerning the substratum of right thinking and well-doing
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.580]   which he knows must have been here, he will have a devil of a time finding it.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:10.540]   When he has assembled all he can and has made even a minimum allowance for speciousness,
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:18.940]   vagueness, and a confusion of motive, he will sadly acknowledge that his net result is simply
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.940]   nothing.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:28.560]   A remnant were here, building a substratum like coral insects.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:36.980]   So much he knows, but he will find nothing to put him on the track of who and where and
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.500]   how many they were and what their work was like.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.860]   Concerning all this, too, the prophet of the present knows precisely as much and as little
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:54.100]   as the historian of the future, and that, I repeat, is what makes his job seem to me
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.500]   so profoundly interesting.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:03.080]   One of the most suggestive episodes recounted in the Bible is that of a prophet's attempt,
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:08.600]   the only attempt of the kind on the record, I believe, to count up the remnant.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.560]   Elijah had fled from persecution into the desert, where the Lord presently overhauled
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.660]   him and asked what he was doing so far away from his job.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:23.860]   He said that he was running away, not because he was a coward, but because all the remnant
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.560]   had been killed off except himself.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:33.160]   He had got away only by the skin of his teeth, and he being now all the remnant there was,
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.000]   if he were killed, the true faith would go flat.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.300]   The Lord replied that he need not worry about that, for even without him, the true faith
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.180]   could probably manage to squeeze along somehow if it had to.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.120]   And as for your figures on the remnant, he said, I don't mind telling you that there
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.960]   are 7,000 of them back there in Israel whom it seems you have not heard of, but you may
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.240]   take my word for it that there they are.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.840]   At that time, probably the population of Israel could not run to much more than a million
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:15.520]   or so, and a remnant of 7,000 out of a million is a highly encouraging percentage for any
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.520]   prophet.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:22.120]   With 7,000 of the boys on his side, there was no great reason for Elijah to feel lonesome,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.440]   and incidentally that would be something for the modern prophet of the remnant to think
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.440]   of when he has a touch of the blues.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:35.420]   But the main point is that if Elijah the prophet could not make a closer guess on the number
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:42.680]   of the remnant than he made when he missed it by 7,000, anyone else who tackled the problem
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.620]   would only waste his time.
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:51.820]   The other certainty which the prophet of the remnant may always have is that the remnant
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.640]   will find him.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.880]   He may rely on that with absolute assurance.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.640]   They will find him without his doing anything about it.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.820]   In fact, if he tries to do anything about it, he is pretty sure to put them off.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:10.720]   He does not need to advertise for them nor resort to any schemes of publicity to get
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.160]   their attention.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.460]   If he is a preacher or a public speaker, for example, he may be quite indifferent to going
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:23.240]   on show at receptions, getting his picture printed in the newspapers, or furnishing autobiographical
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.200]   material for publication on the side of human interest.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:33.160]   If a writer, he need not make a point of attending any pink teas, autographing books at wholesale,
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.320]   nor entering into any specious freemasonry with reviewers.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:43.100]   All this and much more of the same order lies in the regular and necessary routine laid
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.780]   down for the prophet of the masses.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:53.200]   It is and must be part of the great general technique of getting the mass man's ear,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.560]   or as our vigorous and excellent publicist, Mr. H.L.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.120]   Mencken puts it, the technique of boob bumping.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.360]   The prophet of the remnant is not bound to this technique.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.520]   He may be quite sure that the remnant will make their own way to him without any adventitious
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.000]   aids.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.960]   Not only so, but if they find him employing any such aids, as I said, it is ten to one
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:23.080]   that they will smell a rat in them and will shear off.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:29.120]   The certainty that the remnant will find him, however, leaves the prophet as much in the
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:35.720]   dark as ever, as helpless as ever in the matter of putting any estimate of any kind upon the
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   remnant.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:42.560]   For, as appears in the case of Elijah, he remains ignorant of who they are that have
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.480]   found him, or where they are, or how many.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:53.120]   They did not write in and tell him about it after the manner of those who admire the vedettes
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.760]   of Hollywood, nor yet do they seek him out and attach themselves to his person.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.800]   They are not that kind.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:07.280]   They take his message, much as drivers take the directions on a roadside signboard, that
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:13.260]   is, with very little thought about the signboard, beyond being gratefully glad that it happened
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:19.140]   to be there, but with every thought about the directions.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:25.680]   This impersonal attitude of the remnant wonderfully enhances the interest of the imaginative prophet's
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.680]   job.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.280]   Once in a while, just about often enough to keep his intellectual curiosity in good working
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:37.760]   order, he will quite accidentally come upon some distinct reflection of his own message
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.520]   in an unsuspected quarter.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:46.000]   This enables him to entertain himself in his leisure moments with agreeable speculations
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.480]   about the course his message may have taken in reaching that particular quarter and about
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.020]   what came of it after it got there.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.900]   Most interesting of all are those instances, if one could only run them down, but one may
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:08.400]   always speculate about them, where the recipient himself no longer knows where, nor when, nor
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.920]   from whom he got the message, or even where, as sometimes happens, he has forgotten that
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   he got it anywhere and imagines that it is all a self-sprung idea of his own.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:24.500]   Such instances as these are probably not infrequent, for without presuming to enroll ourselves
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:30.060]   among the remnant, we can all no doubt remember having found ourselves suddenly under the
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:36.280]   influence of an idea, the source of which we cannot possibly identify.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:42.120]   It came to us afterward, as we say, that is, we are aware of it only after it has shot
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:48.520]   up full grown in our minds, leaving us quite ignorant of how and when and by what agency
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.620]   it was planted there and left to germinate.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:58.220]   It seems highly probable that the prophet's message often takes some such course with
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.740]   the remnant.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:08.640]   If, for example, you are a writer or a speaker or a preacher, you put forth an idea which
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:15.940]   lodges in the Unbewusstsein of a casual member of the remnant and sticks fasts there.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.520]   For some time, it is inert.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:27.880]   Then it begins to fret and fester until presently it invades the man's conscious mind and,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.620]   as one might say, corrupts it.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:37.300]   Meanwhile, he has quite forgotten how he came by the idea in the first instance, and even
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.700]   perhaps thinks he has invented it.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:47.000]   And in those circumstances, the most interesting thing of all is that you never know what the
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.280]   pressure of that idea will make him do.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:59.980]   For these reasons, it appears to me that Isaiah's job is not only good, but also extremely
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.800]   interesting, and especially so at the present time when nobody is doing it.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.040]   If I were young and had the notion of embarking in the prophetical line, I would certainly
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:15.120]   take up this branch of the business, and therefore I have no hesitation about recommending it
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.760]   as a career for anyone in that position.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.960]   It offers an open field with no competition.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:29.120]   Our civilization so completely neglects and disallows the remnant that anyone going in
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:35.240]   with an eye single to their service might pretty well count on getting all the trade
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.060]   there is.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:46.240]   Even assuming that there is some social salvage to be screened out of the masses, even assuming
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:52.660]   that the testimony of history to their social value is a little too sweeping, that it depresses
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:59.600]   hopelessness a little too far, one must yet perceive, I think, that the masses have profits
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.980]   enough and to spare.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.160]   Even admitting that in the teeth of history that hope of the human race may not be quite
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:13.400]   exclusively centered in the remnant, one must perceive that they have social value enough
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:20.080]   to entitle them to some measure of prophetic encouragement and consolation, and that our
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.680]   civilization allows them none whatever.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.480]   Every prophetic voice is addressed to the masses, and to them alone.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:33.920]   The voice of the pulpit, the voice of education, the voice of politics, of literature, drama,
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:39.400]   journalism, all these are directed towards the masses exclusively, and they marshal the
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   masses in the way that they are going.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:50.880]   One might suggest, therefore, that aspiring prophetical talent may well turn to another
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   field.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.280]   "Sat te patriae priamoctatum."
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:37:01.600]   "Whatever obligation of the kind may be due the masses is already monstrously overpaid."
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:08.360]   So long as the masses are taking up the tabernacle of Moloch and Qun, their images, and following
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.080]   the star of their god Buncombe, they will have no lack of prophets to point the way
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:19.600]   that leadeth to the more abundant life, and hence a few of those who feel the prophetic
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:26.480]   afflatus might do better to apply themselves to serving the remnant.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:34.840]   It is a good job, an interesting job, much more interesting than serving the masses,
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:45.440]   and moreover, it is the only job in our whole civilization, as far as I know, that offers
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.040]   a virgin field.
