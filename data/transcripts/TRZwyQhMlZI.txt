[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Today's question comes to us from Austin, and it's a trio of questions, really.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.600]   He writes, "Pastor John, hello, and thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.440]   My question is whether or not we should be praying for healing for our friends with physical and cognitive
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.960]   disabilities such as Down syndrome, autism, or cerebral palsy.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.740]   We see Jesus heal people with physical disabilities in the Gospels,
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.040]   so should we pray for similar healing?
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.720]   If not, how should we encourage our friends with disabilities with the truth that they are made in God's image?
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.640]   And will individuals in heaven still have their disabilities to some extent?
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.480]   Thank you for your insights and your help on this."
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.920]   So there are three questions here, aren't there? One, should we pray
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.680]   for healing for our friends with physical and cognitive disabilities
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.080]   such as Down syndrome, autism, and cerebral palsy?
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.120]   Two,
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.040]   how should we encourage our friends with disabilities with the truth that they are made in the image of God? And
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.680]   three,
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.480]   will individuals in heaven still have their disabilities? Now, I'm gonna save that
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.280]   first question about prayer
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.560]   for last. I think how we pray is affected by how we answer these second two questions.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.440]   So let's start with number two. How should we encourage our friends with disabilities
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   with the truth that they are made in the image of God? Now, my response may be surprising.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.080]   My response to this question is that I don't devote much effort to this
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.840]   because I think Christians have a far, far
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.920]   greater gift
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.440]   to give
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.640]   to the disabled than to help them know
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.440]   they are made in the image of God. If I were to try to encourage people that they are made in the image of God,
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.040]   I would say it involves two things. One,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.840]   speaking the truth of God's Word to the effect that all humans are created in the image of God. Genesis 1:26,
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.120]   5-1, 9-6, James 3-9, and
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.840]   secondly,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840]   by treating people,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.560]   disabled people, as persons, not projects. That would be my answer to the question, but
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.640]   let me encourage
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.760]   Austin and everybody else that focusing on
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.800]   helping people feel good about being created in the image of God is not a very high goal and
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.000]   in the end, not a hopeful goal. Think of it. There are two reasons
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.200]   for why I say this. One is that every
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.800]   human is made in the image of God, which means that God's enemies are created in his image,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.680]   unrepentant rebels are created in God's image, people who are under God's wrath
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.160]   are created in God's image, people that God sends to hell
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:09.040]   for unbelief and disobedience were made in his image. Being in the image of God is not a hopeful condition.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.920]   To focus on helping people feel created in God's image is not a saving effort. A second reason
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.400]   why helping people know they are created in God's image is not a high or hopeful goal is
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.840]   that Christians have a
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.360]   spectacularly higher, more hopeful message.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.080]   When we offer Christ,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.720]   we invite people to be not the created image of God, but the
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.080]   recreated child of God, a new creation in Christ.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.400]   We don't offer the experience of a doomed and defaced image.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.840]   We offer spirit-given
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.260]   conformity to the image of God's Son,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.920]   wrought by the Spirit. We offer the forgiveness of sins,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.120]   the removal of divine wrath against his image-bearers,
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.800]   the escape from all condemnation,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.840]   the triumph over our sinful nature, the defeat of death, the hope of eternal life with God,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.360]   not merely as his image-bearer, but as his loved, adopted
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.280]   child.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.320]   That's what we offer to disabled people, and with it a dignity far beyond
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.320]   being created in God's image. And if the cognitive
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.680]   impairment—this is important, this is not just an
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.480]   afterthought—if the cognitive
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.600]   impairment is so severe
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.200]   that we can't tell if our message of hope is getting through,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.000]   we remain
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.840]   faithful to their care, and we entrust their souls to the mercy of God the way we do our
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.000]   children who die in infancy.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.800]   Now,
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.120]   third question. So start with number two, go to number three.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.480]   Austin asks, "Will individuals in heaven still have their disabilities?" The answer is no.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.320]   And you might wonder, "Why did he ask that? Isn't that obvious?"
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.000]   I think there's more behind this question, and I'll get to it in just a minute.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.360]   So my answer is no, they won't, and my reason for saying so is twofold.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.640]   One part of the reason is that Jesus' ministry was a foretaste of the kingdom, right? He said that when I cast out demons,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.160]   the kingdom of God has come upon you. Heaven has come upon you when I cast out demons. And the same thing is true when
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.800]   he healed people's disabilities, like being blind from birth or being unable to stand up for 18 years.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.000]   So the ministry of Jesus is a beautiful
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.560]   trailer, a foretaste of what the new heavens and the new earth will be like.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.000]   He will do away with all sickness and disease and disability.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.600]   Now the second part of the reason I think disabilities will be done away with is because
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.560]   Revelation 21 4 says, "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.040]   Death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.320]   any more, for the former things have passed away."
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.200]   The things that brought
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:40.400]   painful crying in this world, whether in parents or in the disabled child or a community,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.280]   whatever brought painful crying into this world will be
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.520]   removed.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.640]   Now,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   it may be that
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.640]   Austin asked whether people would have their disabilities in heaven
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.040]   because he sees that in some cases
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.480]   the so-called
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.400]   disability, for example with a Down syndrome person, the so-called
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.760]   disability is so interwoven with the limits and beauties of
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.840]   the personality that it is scarcely
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.640]   imaginable that such people would be the same person if the disability were removed.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.720]   That might be what's behind his question, which is a very, very good question.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   Now my answer to this is that God is God.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.280]   It's a short answer. God is God and in his infinite
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.800]   capacities of
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.120]   preserving true personhood and
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.240]   making new personhood, he will preserve
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   everything good that he created and he will remove everything that the fall distorted and
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.800]   we will know each other with the precious old,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.560]   preserved, but radically renewed.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.480]   Somehow he'll do it.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.640]   Which brings us now just to this last, I mean the first question.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.360]   Should we pray for healing for our friends with physical cognitive disabilities such as
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.520]   Down syndrome, autism, and cerebral palsy, he says.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.240]   My guess is that when a couple
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.600]   hears a doctor say that the baby in the womb has a genetic disorder
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.280]   that will result in a disability,
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:45.360]   they do pray and they should pray that God would intervene and heal
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.440]   that genetic
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.240]   problem so the baby is born without that disorder.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.280]   But in many cases, I suppose we'd all agree,
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.080]   most cases,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.360]   disabilities are sooner or later perceived
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.040]   by the parents, by the community, by the church, by the child to be God's
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   sovereign will for the family.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.520]   They come to the conclusion and it's not a sinful conclusion.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:22.000]   This is God's appointment for us and for our child. It would not be sin,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.800]   I don't think, to pray at any given point along the way for a dramatic transformation.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.080]   But neither is it a sin to hear the voice of God saying, "I will strengthen you.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.080]   I will help you. I will uphold you with my righteous right hand,
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.640]   and I will do more good through this painful providence than you can even imagine."
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:50.040]   But then the question becomes not whether we should pray for the disabled, but rather
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.480]   how should we pray for them and their families?
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.560]   Because the fact that God says no
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.080]   to the
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.080]   genetic reordering
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.120]   in the womb
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:11.040]   does not mean he says no to a thousand other prayers for this child,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.840]   for this family. In the mystery of God's
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   providences, call them severe mercies,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.640]   there is a lavish
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.680]   willingness on the part of God
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:33.560]   to help in ways that at the beginning the families can't even scarcely imagine that they will need.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.200]   So the answer is yes.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.720]   Yes, pray, pray,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.560]   pray for the disabled and their families.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.520]   God is in the business of lifting burdens through his people and through the prayers of his people.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.160]   He is in the business of providing
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.720]   shelter in the storm.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.560]   The storm that he himself has sent.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.280]   When you stop and think about it,
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:08.680]   most of us live under the cloud of some great unanswered prayer. That is a prayer for some conversion,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.280]   a prayer for a rescued relationship,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.840]   some healing, some calamity that didn't get removed.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:27.040]   God said, "No, my grace is sufficient for you," like he did to Paul in 2 Corinthians 12.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.720]   And we know that under that cloud of
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.760]   "no,"
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.280]   "no," there are hundreds of yeses
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:42.720]   that God is ready to give to those who trust him and ask him for help.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.400]   So I say that just to point out we're all in this together
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:57.480]   with the disabled, and the answer is yes. Let's pray for each other. Pray for each other.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.760]   Thank you for answering all three questions, Pastor John and Austin. Thanks for the questions and for your concern for your friend.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.480]   That's compelling in itself, brother. So thank you for that.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:13.320]   If this episode prompted a question of its own, send it to us at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.920]   This is episode 1708. If you want to mention it, give a follow-up and
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:25.120]   send it to us. Go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. That's our homepage. See the button where you can ask a question.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.080]   Well, it's Thanksgiving week here in the States. Next time
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.480]   we are going to learn from the Apostle Paul, one of the most thankful people of his generation, a man who used the word
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:43.160]   "thanks" about 50 times in his epistles. It's incredible. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We will see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.160]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
