[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   something happened where they forced my hand.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   This is the only time that a Soviet agent was anywhere near me
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.920]   on the territory of the United States.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.120]   So I'm waiting for the A train on a dark morning still in Queens
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.420]   and there's this man in a black trench coat
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.960]   comes up to me from my right and he whispers into my ears,
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.240]   "You gotta come back or else you're dead."
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.740]   The following is a conversation with Jack Barsky,
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.500]   a former KGB spy, author of Deep Undercover,
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.360]   and the subject of an excellent podcast series called The Agent.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.780]   There are very few people who have defected from the KGB
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.040]   and live to tell the story.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.920]   It is one of the most powerful intelligence organizations in history.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.740]   And this conversation gives a window into its operation,
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.160]   both from an ideological and psychological perspectives,
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.500]   but also it tells the story of a man
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.160]   who lived one heck of an incredible life.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.360]   This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.740]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.120]   And now, dear friends, here's Jack Barsky.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.320]   Let's start with a big basic question.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.200]   What is the KGB?
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.900]   - Right, so that is the Committee of State Security.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900]   Yeah, there's an apostolist, this is a,
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.320]   apostolist is a threat, right?
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.160]   - Threat.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.320]   - Okay, and bs means?
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.160]   - Without.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.980]   - Right.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.700]   - And I guess that directly translates
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.360]   to security, without threat.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.540]   - So, and don't exist anymore.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.160]   It was disbanded when the Soviet Union fell apart
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.160]   and the successor agencies are now the SVR and the FSB.
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.120]   FSB supposedly the equivalent to the FBI and SVR, the CIA,
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.080]   but the SVR is relatively weak
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   and the FSB has taken on a lot of espionage
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   and active measures and they're much bigger and stronger,
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.620]   but the most capable intelligence agency in Russia
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.580]   is the GRU, military intelligence.
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.400]   - That nobody knows very much about.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.240]   - That's right.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.200]   When I was in the KGB, I had no idea
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.080]   that there was military intelligence.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.360]   Nobody ever mentioned anything like that.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.920]   And by the way, I recently had the pleasure
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.540]   to give a talk at the DIA.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.000]   When they reached out to me,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.600]   I didn't know they existed either.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.920]   - Interesting.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.480]   Yeah, that's always the question.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.160]   If you want to be an intelligence agency,
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.500]   should the world know anything about you?
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.640]   Because in some sense, you want to create the legend
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.400]   in order to attract great, competent individuals
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.720]   to work for you, but at the same time,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.160]   you want it to be shrouded in complete mystery.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.840]   If nobody knows you exist,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.720]   you might be able to operate well
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.760]   as an intelligence agency.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.880]   That is fascinating, but FSB is the thing
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.240]   that carries the flag of KGB,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   KGB being probably one of, if not the most,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.800]   sort of infamous, famous, infamous,
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.320]   and powerful intelligence agencies.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.760]   - In history, yes. - Ever.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.320]   - Absolutely, 100%.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.160]   - It was founded in 1954 after the death of Stalin.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.200]   You've, in writing your book,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.120]   looked back at the predecessors of the history.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.520]   Is there some way in which the KGB
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.440]   is grounded in the culture, the spirit,
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.600]   the soul of its predecessors?
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.760]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.840]   They just changed names and they changed personnel,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.600]   rather frequently, and that had something to do
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.960]   with Stalin's paranoia.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.440]   From between 1923, and I don't remember what,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   I think it may have been the NKVD at that time.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   It started as a Cheka, and then it became the GPU,
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.200]   the NKVD, yes. - It's three or four letter words.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.880]   - But with those name changes,
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.960]   you also had changes at the top.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.120]   Between 1923 and 1953, when Stalin died,
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   that is 30 years, they had eight heads of intelligence,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.640]   and of those eight, six were executed
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.200]   when they were replaced.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   So that's an indication that this was an organization
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.280]   that ate itself from the inside.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.880]   The Soviet Union was the only dictatorship in history
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.840]   that did not rest its powers on the military.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.680]   They rested its powers on the intelligence apparatus,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.760]   and that thing was unstable.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.280]   So you know where that leads.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.880]   Eventually, if you rest your power on something
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   that is made out of bricks that don't hold a lot of load,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.200]   it will fall apart.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.440]   - On sand. - Yeah.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.120]   - Why was it unstable, would you say?
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.320]   What of human nature makes it unstable?
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.040]   - It's the paranoia.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.840]   Stalin was always worried about
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.200]   the most powerful people coming after him.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.400]   So he proactively killed off heads of the KGB,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.480]   and he had this great purge where he got rid
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.380]   of a lot of his generals, really capable generals.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.600]   And that cost him dearly when World War II started,
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   because he started off with a force
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.800]   that wasn't as capable as it could have been.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.880]   - Was it paranoia at all levels?
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.080]   - I believe so, I believe so.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.560]   It comes from the top.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.640]   And so if the top doesn't trust you,
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   you always have to worry about your peers snitching on you.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.160]   - Yeah. - Okay?
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.840]   So, and I think we have a very similar situation
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.940]   in Russia today.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.680]   And in this kind of atmosphere,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.160]   the truth will never get to the top.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.160]   - So no matter what moral rules the organization operates
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160]   under, trust is fundamental to its competence.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.040]   - Oh, absolutely, and I wanna extend this
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.300]   to my own existence.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.000]   And this is kind of strange, it's almost dichotomous,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   because I was running around lying to everybody,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.840]   and I couldn't fundamentally be trusted.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.060]   But the relationship that I had with the KGB
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.200]   was based on trust.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.000]   If they don't trust me, they don't send me out.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.800]   And if I don't trust them, I'm not going.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   And I eventually broke that trust,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.840]   and they knew there was always that danger.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.040]   - They knew that because something about you,
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.920]   or just something about human beings--
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.920]   - No, there were hints about how long my assignment would be,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   so 10 to 12 years.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.840]   And you see, it makes sense, all right?
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.480]   I was becoming an American, and over time,
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.680]   I would become more and more American,
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.920]   and there was always a chance that I liked it
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.000]   more here than there, that I was really successful
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.540]   in what I was supposed to do.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.640]   And it sort of happened, but in my case,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.720]   it happened because I fathered a child
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.640]   who I didn't wanna leave when they wanted me back.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.640]   - Love always screws up your employment competence, yes.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.760]   - You're absolutely right.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.040]   But they thought that I had an anchor at home
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.520]   because I had a wife and a son at home,
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.520]   which you've gotta worry about them if you defect.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:58.360]   Because in the past, the KGB would go after family,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.040]   ruthlessly.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.200]   - Including perhaps violence?
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.040]   - Yeah.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.760]   - This is a hard question about the KGB
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.200]   because it's one of the most ruthless organizations,
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   but in general, are there lines, KGB agents
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.920]   at every level of the hierarchy that they would not cross?
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.880]   Political, legal, ethical, or does anything goes
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.280]   to achieve the goal?
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   - I was only in touch with two types of agents,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.680]   whether the technical experts,
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.520]   the ones that taught me tradecraft,
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.240]   and they were like engineers,
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.640]   and they were in charge of the secret writing,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   and the Morse code, shortwave radio reception,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.260]   decryption, encryption, and that kind of stuff.
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.960]   Those were just doing their job, all right?
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.480]   And the others, the ones that trained me,
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.060]   that prepared me for life in the United States,
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.240]   they were nice people.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.760]   They were elegant people.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.320]   I don't think, they would not fit into the stereotype
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.920]   of the ruthless, gun-carrying agent.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.360]   - Is it possible that you would not be aware
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.340]   of the parts of the KGB?
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.840]   I mean, it's very modular.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   Would you, it's possible that you're not aware
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.440]   of the parts of the KGB that are the quote-unquote muscle?
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.960]   - Oh, I didn't know.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.960]   I would find out afterwards, after I retired
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.320]   and started doing some research.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.560]   I had no clue.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.200]   - You're kind of operating in a bubble.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.580]   - Oh, very much so.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.400]   I mean, this is what the KGB did really, really well,
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   compartmentalization, and that was based on
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.040]   the communist movement while it was still underground.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.000]   The cells were very small,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.680]   so that maybe there were three, four members in one cell
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.600]   that knew one another,
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.700]   and then they had a liaison to another cell.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.800]   So the bottom line is if you got,
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.320]   one of those folks were caught,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.280]   they could maybe betray four people or three,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.360]   something like that,
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.800]   and the KGB continued with that tradition.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.520]   I have reason to believe that my handler,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.860]   the person in Moscow that sort of directed me
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.640]   and made decisions what to do and where to go,
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.720]   never met me personally.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.160]   There's no reason to, right?
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.160]   Why would, so, and this actually was a big advantage
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.200]   over other intelligence services,
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.040]   because you look at what the CIA does, everybody blabs.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.840]   There's a lot of leaks coming out of American intelligence.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.200]   I don't think there's as many leaks
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   coming out of the Mossad.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.680]   - Strong words from Jack Barsky, by the way.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.680]   So, I mean, that is a question I wanna ask
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.880]   a little more systematically.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   Is there something unique about the KGB
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.080]   compared to the other intelligence agencies?
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.080]   Let's talk British intelligence, MI6, Mossad, CIA.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.360]   Is there unique cultures, spirits, souls
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.640]   of the different organizations
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.480]   that maybe somehow connect to the structures of government,
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.440]   connect maybe the values of the people,
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.680]   those kinds of things?
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   - I believe we were all pretty much strong believers
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.480]   in communism and the future of the world being--
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.000]   - In KGB? - Yes.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I think that unified us to a large degree,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.360]   even the technicians.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.320]   - So even, it wasn't something like,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.560]   yeah, yeah, the parents believe this thing,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.120]   but we know the truth.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.240]   You really believe the story of communism.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.840]   - Absolutely did, and you need to look at the timeframe.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.620]   The Soviet Union, after World War II,
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.920]   made quite a bit of progress
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.880]   in influencing the third world.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.840]   I still remember when I was in middle school,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.240]   we had a map, the map of the world,
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.040]   and it was color-coded.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.840]   So red was communism, that was the Soviet Union
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.200]   and the Eastern states, and then blue was capitalism,
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.920]   and then we had green,
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.280]   which were the third world countries,
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.880]   and the green slowly turned pink
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.240]   because a lot of third world governments,
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.400]   so I'm looking at Angola, I'm looking at Vietnam,
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:37.760]   a lot of these countries were very sympathetic
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.320]   to the Soviet Union, and so we sort of knew
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.520]   that this would go on like that,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.120]   and eventually we would take over,
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.120]   and pretty much overtake, that was the myth,
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.560]   overtake the United States, not only militarily,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   but also in terms of industrial production and so forth.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.800]   That was a stupid pipe dream.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.980]   The military, it was a standoff, as we know.
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.200]   - Well, stupid pipe dream.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.600]   Hitler had a stupid pipe dream
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.480]   that he executed exceptionally effectively on,
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   if not for a handful of military mistakes,
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.320]   the world could look very different today.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.120]   - Well, the biggest one being invading the Soviet Union,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.680]   particularly at the time that he did it,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.240]   because he ran into the same thing
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.280]   that Napoleon ran into, General Winter.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.880]   - Well, within, so Operation Barbarossa,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.360]   within that, he could have made different decisions,
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.480]   for example, attacking, skipping Kiev
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.040]   and attacking Moscow directly,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.480]   overthrowing the government.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.140]   So marching, I guess that would be learning lessons
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.240]   from Napoleon as opposed to a different kind
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.800]   of distribution of forces,
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.480]   and then getting bogged down in the winter.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   But the point is, these ambitions sometimes do,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.600]   the ambitions of empire sometimes do materialize
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.720]   in the growth and the building and the establishment
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.200]   of those empires, and those empires write the history books
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.200]   in such a way that we don't think of them as empires,
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.760]   or we certainly don't think of them as the bad guys.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.960]   They write the history books,
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.520]   therefore they're the good guys.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.760]   And right now, America has effectively written the book
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.120]   about the good guys.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.200]   I happen to believe that book,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.080]   but we should be humbled and open-minded
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.200]   to realize that that is in fact what is happening,
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.220]   is effective empires write the history books
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.760]   and tell us stories and tell us propaganda
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.600]   and tell us narratives that we believe
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.440]   because we are human beings,
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.840]   and we love to get together and believe ideas.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.280]   We love to dream of a beautiful world
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.520]   and try to build that beautiful world together.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.400]   In the United States, that's a beautiful world,
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.120]   the freedom of respect of human rights,
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.120]   of all men are created equal, pursuit of happiness.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.120]   You know, it always sounds good.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.040]   If you look at what the dream of communism is,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.600]   it sure as heck, in its words, on the surface, sounds good.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.400]   Respect for the workers, the working class,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.580]   the lower classes that have been trodden on,
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.560]   that have been stolen from by the powerful.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.160]   They deserve to have the money, the power,
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.000]   the respect that they have earned
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.240]   through their hard work, sounds great.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.800]   - And everybody gets along, we just have to,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.560]   all men are wonderful people,
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.080]   and if they go bad, it has something to do with the fact
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.600]   that they have been oppressed, right?
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.880]   And that dream just never worked out.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.320]   And even it is, when you think about it,
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.880]   and I didn't think about it.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.700]   When you're young, you just emotionally, you accept it.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.920]   But when you think about it,
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.900]   somehow that new wonderful organization
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.120]   has to organize itself.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.560]   Even though Lenin predicted
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.440]   that the state eventually would go away.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.880]   Well, how does it work?
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.760]   Then you have like anarchy, right?
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.720]   You have to have an organization.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.920]   And the only way to really organize a large number of people
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.660]   is with a hierarchy.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.520]   So, and who gets to the top?
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.520]   The ones that want to go to the top,
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.920]   the ones that believe in themselves,
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.180]   the ones that know better than everybody else.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.480]   And once you have that hierarchy established,
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.480]   there is no guarantee that it won't go bad.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.200]   And actually, when you look at history,
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.840]   every such hierarchy has gone bad.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.120]   You know, you look at Cuba, for instance,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.280]   I believe Fidel Castro was an honest revolutionary.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.400]   I do believe that.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.040]   And so what did Cuba turn into?
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   - Yeah, there's something about,
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.920]   and you speak about Vladimir Putin in this way,
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.420]   but let's step away from that for a second.
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:12.700]   Is there something about being an honest revolutionary
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.540]   that wants to do good for their country,
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.300]   and you start to believe that you know better
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.840]   than everyone else how to do good in the country?
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.960]   And you very well might first,
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   but then somehow that grows into a distortion field
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.000]   where you keep believing you know what's right,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.840]   and all the people who disagree with you,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.080]   you stop seeing them as having a point.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.160]   You instead see them as like
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.740]   evil manipulators of the truth
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.620]   that are actually trying to hurt people
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.700]   for their own greed, for their own power,
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.460]   and you will protect the people
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.820]   because you know what's good.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.540]   In the case of Stalin, I mean, I don't know,
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.540]   but it seems like he really believed
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:04.300]   that communism would bring about a much better world.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.780]   I mean, there was a sense,
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.960]   you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.020]   This idea that sacrifice is necessary
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.540]   to bring about a greater world.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.540]   And then the other aspect is sort of ruling by terror,
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.860]   creating terrors that justify a political mechanism
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.580]   to achieve a better world.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.780]   So it wasn't, I mean, perhaps he had to do that
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.140]   to be able to sleep at night
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.740]   with the atrocities he's committing.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.580]   I think he believed he will bring about a better world.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.860]   - And by the way, the terror didn't start with Stalin.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.340]   It started right after the Bolsheviks took over
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.340]   when Lenin told Mr. Jelzinski,
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.500]   Comrade Jelzinski to build the Chekhov
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.500]   and then execute the, this is what he called it,
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.620]   the Red Terror.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:07.540]   So at the birth of the Soviet Union,
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.900]   there was already terror and it was deliberate.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.900]   And it also was, it wasn't just focused on the enemies.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.420]   It was focused on whoever you didn't like.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.860]   There was no rule of law.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.660]   There was no court cases.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.800]   People were just pulled out of their apartments
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   and shot on sight.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:36.380]   And this was done by revolutionaries
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.820]   who were convinced that eventually,
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.140]   that these sacrifices had to be made
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.540]   and eventually that would lead to a much better planet.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.180]   - And the populists believed this too,
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.900]   that those sacrifices, in part.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.140]   I mean, this is such a dark thing about dictatorships
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.980]   is you believe it,
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.340]   but you're also too afraid to question your beliefs.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.700]   Like you're not directly afraid,
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.740]   but almost like, I don't know what that is.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.820]   That's almost like a subconscious fear.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.860]   Like don't, there's a dark room with a locked door.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.220]   Don't look in that door.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.540]   Don't check that door.
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.260]   And there's something about the United States
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.980]   that says, especially modern culture,
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.660]   it's like go to that door first.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.360]   And sort of question everything kind of,
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.060]   that's the power of the freedom of speech
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.100]   and the freedom of the press,
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.220]   but you can get, almost become too critical
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.220]   and too cynical of your own culture in that way.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.060]   So there's a balance to strike, of course,
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.380]   but man, if communism is not a lesson of human nature,
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.380]   I don't know what is, but you believed,
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.100]   without thinking too much about it,
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.500]   you believed in the story of communism.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.740]   What did you see just, you know,
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.500]   I came from the Soviet Union.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.260]   What did you maybe feel
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:59.860]   that's right and good about communism,
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.380]   about the vision of communism?
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.900]   Could you remember like--
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.540]   - I think the biggest impetus in me believing in communism
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.940]   was that the communists,
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.500]   when just before Hitler took over,
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.720]   the communists were the only force in Germany
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.740]   that fought the Nazis in the streets.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.820]   And that's a historic truth.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.660]   - Yes.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.220]   - And communists were hunted down by the Nazis,
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.940]   killed, put in concentration camps.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.940]   And so what we knew, when what we were taught,
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.420]   and I think that was a huge unforced error
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.680]   by the Western countries, particularly the United States,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.580]   that there were ex-Nazis in the government in West Germany.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.420]   - Yeah.
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.420]   - And the most famous one was Reinhard Galen,
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.060]   who was in charge, was the general in charge
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.060]   of the intelligence on the Eastern Front under Hitler.
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:10.260]   And when the Allied won the war,
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.900]   it was decided that Galen was too important,
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.140]   with his knowledge and his organization,
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.940]   was too important to not use.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.660]   So he was co-opted by the CIA and eventually wound up
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.500]   being the head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst,
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.380]   the CIA of West Germany.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.500]   That gave us, us, when I say us,
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   you know, the East German party, a huge propaganda victory.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.700]   I wanted to, because the emotional aspect of this
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.180]   was as follows.
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.180]   When we were in, juniors in high school,
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:53.980]   and in those days, when you, you were only allowed
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.100]   to go to high school if you were in the top 10%
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.500]   of students, okay, so this was going to be
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   the next set of ruling elite in the country.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.740]   We were sent, we were required to visit
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.020]   a concentration camp.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:13.580]   And if you know what we, as 17-year-olds,
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.060]   were made to look at, it was gut-wrenching.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.940]   How can men do something like that to men?
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.380]   Piles of corpses,
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.380]   lampshades made out of human skin
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.660]   because that skin had tattoos on them,
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.340]   and a shrunken head, so heads like the size of my fist.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.140]   I mean, the girls all cried.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.500]   And it made a huge impression.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.540]   - And that was the Nazis.
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.380]   - Yes.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.220]   - And the communists defeated the Nazis.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.060]   - The communists were the Nazi fighters.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:49.900]   They were the good guys.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.380]   Of course, in hindsight, if the communists
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.580]   had come to power, it would have been
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.420]   just the other way around, as we know,
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.820]   given the example of Stalin and Mao, right?
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.100]   So, but we didn't know that, right?
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.380]   - From the Russian, Soviet perspective,
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:09.140]   the communist regime banded together
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.620]   to win the great patriotic war.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.460]   - And that was the second one,
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.100]   the big brother, the Soviet Union.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.020]   I mean, when I was approached by the KGB,
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.340]   that was like, oh, I felt so honored.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:28.300]   - So we should say that we're talking
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.540]   about East Germany, that you're from East Germany.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:36.060]   Can you describe, you were born four years in,
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:36.900]   what is it?
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.740]   - Yeah, four years.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.580]   - 10 days?
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.460]   - Yeah, sort of, very good.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.060]   - After Germany's unconditional surrender
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.820]   in World War II.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.100]   So what is East Germany, what is West Germany?
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.980]   What is East and West Germany?
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.500]   What is that, what's the difference?
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.380]   What's the historical context here?
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.620]   What is World War II again?
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.620]   And then, let's do--
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.180]   - We don't have to go to World War I,
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.340]   which the result of which actually
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.260]   seeded World War II in some respect.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.700]   - Yes, there's a long history, yes.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.220]   - But let's start with World War II.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.580]   So when Hitler came to power,
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:19.580]   he and his leadership decided that the Germans
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.780]   needed more what they called Lebensraum,
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.060]   that means room to live.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.780]   And they would start expanding,
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.140]   and they went into France,
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.180]   they took Belgium, the Netherlands,
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.180]   they annexed Austria,
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:43.900]   and got a piece of Czechoslovakia.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.700]   And then they decided to march into the Soviet Union
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.260]   after they took Poland.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:55.180]   - Cut up Poland together with the Soviet Union.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.020]   - Yes.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.860]   - They were friends.
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:57.700]   - Yes.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.540]   - They were--
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.380]   - It was a non-aggression pact
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.300]   that was signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov, right?
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.300]   I think both parties knew that eventually
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.020]   they would fall apart, but at the time,
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.740]   it gave the Soviet Union a little more,
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.660]   a piece of Poland, and a little more time
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:19.500]   to prepare what they thought might happen down the road.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.500]   And the Germans had the time and the ability
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:29.260]   to pretty much conquer all of Western Europe.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.660]   - Do you think Stalin really knew
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.020]   that it's gonna fall apart?
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.460]   - Why would somebody like Stalin
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.020]   trust somebody like Hitler?
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.940]   - But why did he blunder so bad
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.660]   not to read the intelligence that was coming his way?
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.500]   - Oh, he didn't--
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.020]   - The troops are amassing on the border of the Soviet Union.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.420]   - He didn't trust his own intelligence apparatus.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.260]   - Boy.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.340]   - Here's one example.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:57.340]   There was a German communist who went underground
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.100]   when Hitler took over, and he went to Japan as a journalist.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.180]   His name is Richard Sorge.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.860]   Richard Sorge had really, really good intel
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:11.700]   about what the Japanese would do and not do.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.180]   I forgot exactly what it was,
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.860]   but it came to Moscow and Stalin totally ignored it.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.860]   And when Sorge was captured by the Japanese,
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.940]   the Soviet Union denied that he was one of theirs,
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.120]   so he was executed.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:34.140]   The paranoia, again, does a lot of damage.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.420]   When you don't believe your own intelligence apparatus,
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.900]   why bother having one?
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.820]   - Yeah, I mean, there,
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.260]   but I'm sure there's contradictory information
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.940]   coming in from the intelligence apparatus,
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.520]   so it's difficult.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.160]   I mean, first of all, nobody likes to be disagreed with,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.380]   especially when you become more and more powerful,
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.300]   and then the intelligence apparatus
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.740]   is probably giving you information you don't like.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.100]   It's often negative information about--
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.300]   - Yeah.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.620]   - Basically, information that says
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.060]   that the decisions you made in the past
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.780]   are not great decisions,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.620]   and that's a difficult truth to deal with.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.460]   - Yeah.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:20.100]   - So, in the modern times, if we hop around briefly,
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.100]   is Vladimir Putin has been not happy
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.180]   with the intelligence of the FSB,
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.940]   thereby, at least if you read the news,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.060]   choosing to put more priority to the GRU
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.900]   for the intelligence in Ukraine.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.740]   - Right.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:43.980]   - But I guess I suppose the same story happens there,
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.700]   as it does throughout history, is paranoia.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.700]   - I give you an example that comes
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.880]   from a very reliable source,
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:00.020]   and that my best German friend worked as a chemist
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.220]   in the Stasi, East German intelligence,
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.220]   and he eventually, he rose to the rank of major
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.080]   and was in charge of the forgery department.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.260]   It's very likely that he made passports
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.780]   that I used to travel.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.660]   He was aware that there was intelligence
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.660]   that was collected.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.420]   The Stasi was really good.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.820]   They had about 1,000 people in West Germany,
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.500]   undercover agents, some of them in government,
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.860]   and the central committee of the party,
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.260]   the decision makers, ignored it
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.220]   because it didn't quite fit in their worldview,
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.500]   it didn't quite fit into their plans.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.900]   So, and one delicious thing
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.980]   that I just wanna add on to this,
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.700]   when Gorbachev wrote his book
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.780]   about Perestroika and Glasnost,
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.540]   the East German rulers did not like it,
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.260]   they were much more orthodox.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.600]   So, they had to print the books in translation.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.140]   Guess where they wound up?
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.080]   They were piled up in the hallways of the Stasi.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.140]   They bought the entire print run.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.660]   - Fascinating.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.700]   But let's backtrack, so Operation Barbarossa,
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.260]   invasion of Hitler to the Soviet Union,
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.940]   and then hopefully that leads us
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.340]   all the way to East Germany, West Germany,
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.420]   after the end of the war.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.900]   - So, what happened was the Soviet Union
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.820]   rolled into the eastern part of Germany,
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.540]   and the Western allies took a larger chunk,
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.260]   which was eventually,
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.820]   it was occupied by the three allies,
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.140]   the French, the English, and the Americans,
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.060]   and the eastern part was occupied by Soviet troops,
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:31:00.060]   and the Soviet troops actually conquered Berlin.
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:05.820]   But in a contract, they decided that Berlin
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.940]   would be ruled by the four allies,
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   and they all had free access to that city.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:18.620]   I was born in the East German part,
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:23.620]   which very quickly became ruled by communists,
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.380]   slash socialists, the Communist Party
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.460]   and the Socialist Party united,
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.300]   but the leaders of that new party were all communists.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.340]   - It's nevertheless called democratic.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.700]   - Yes, German Democratic Republic,
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.700]   which was formed a couple of months after I was born.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:46.940]   I was born into a remote southeastern corner
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:51.620]   of East Germany, and interestingly enough,
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.460]   genetically, I'm only half German.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.660]   - What's the other half?
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.500]   - The other half is Czech and Polish.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.340]   - Nice.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.100]   - Because where I grew up, I could walk to the Neisse River,
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.580]   which was the border with Poland,
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.500]   and it was only about an hour by bus
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:14.500]   to get to the Czech border, so that's why I'm a mix.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.900]   - So, okay, so East Germany after the war
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.420]   was communist, socialist,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.500]   and then the West Germany was representing
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.100]   the Western world with democracy.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.580]   - And what the United States did,
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:33.540]   this was really, really very forward-looking,
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.500]   very strategic, the Marshall Plan,
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.260]   to rebuild the economy in the West,
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.300]   as compared to what the Soviet Union did.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.180]   Whatever they hadn't destroyed on the way in,
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.460]   they took with them on the way out for reparations,
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.260]   because they had every right to do that,
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.260]   but it was not a good idea,
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.460]   because East Germany was always behind
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:01.480]   in economic development to their Western counterpart.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.100]   - So when you were young, as today,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.340]   but when you were young,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.900]   you were clearly an exceptional student.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.700]   You're a brilliant academic superstar.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.660]   Let's go to your childhood.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.260]   What's a fond memory from childhood that you have
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.940]   in being woken up to the beauty of this world,
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.580]   and sort of being curious about all the mysteries
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:31.020]   around you that I think ultimately lead to academic success?
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.980]   Or was it--
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.380]   - The fondest memory that comes to mind is my first kiss.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.500]   - How's that?
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.400]   Do you wanna go to the details of that?
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.660]   What'd you make of that kiss?
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.500]   What'd that teach you about yourself
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.300]   and human nature and all that?
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.100]   - It taught me only in hindsight.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.700]   At the time, I was just like, my God,
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.660]   I was head over heels in love.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.300]   I was 16 years old.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:05.180]   And I knew in those days, I admired girls.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:10.180]   I knew that girls were like sort of magical beings.
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.460]   They were not capable of doing evil things.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.000]   They were beautiful and they had to be adored.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.960]   And one of them actually loved me too.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.920]   She came after me initially, right?
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.680]   - And that too was magical for you.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.800]   - Oh my God, yeah.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.440]   (Lex laughing)
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.320]   And I literally, I dedicated,
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.680]   that's when I started studying.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.320]   Up until that point, I just did whatever I had to do
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.600]   to be in A-minus students.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.920]   And that's when I started studying.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.600]   And every A that I got, I dedicated to her,
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.800]   sometimes explicitly,
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.400]   because I knew I was gonna take care of her as I grew up.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.560]   - So you're gonna have to work hard in this world
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.640]   to be somebody that could be adored by those you love.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.000]   - Yes, you're right.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.840]   You know, that kiss,
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.320]   the next day I was running around in school
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.680]   with a grin on my face.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.800]   - And maybe that, in some way, that grin never fades.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.920]   So what about the heartbreak that followed?
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.760]   - Well, the heartbreak followed.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.240]   - Surely followed.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.920]   - But just to expand on this a little more,
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   because that passion that I had
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.120]   was an indication that eventually
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.600]   love would play a big role in my life.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.560]   I wasn't aware of it.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.800]   I was just directed at this one girl, but--
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.280]   - But you understood that that feeling--
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.120]   - Oh my God, yeah.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:38.940]   - That taught you something,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.080]   that you're somebody that can feel those things.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:41.920]   - Absolutely.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.280]   - And that's a strong part of who you are,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.400]   and therefore it will also be a part
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.800]   of directing your life trajectory.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.840]   - Yeah, so we were an item for two years.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.320]   I lost my virginity.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.160]   - Congratulations.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.680]   - She was not a virgin at the time.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.200]   My competitor was--
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.280]   - There always is a competitor, isn't there?
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.320]   Isn't that how it works?
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.700]   - He studied medicine in college already.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.780]   - In which ways was he better than you?
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.380]   - He wasn't, he was older and he was more experienced.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.080]   And he was gonna be a doctor.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.540]   But I was there and he was not.
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.740]   Presence wins.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.900]   - Yeah, but you still had big dreams.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.340]   You wanted to be a tenure professor.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.240]   - Yes, yes.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.420]   - So you still want to outdo that guy.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.580]   - Oh yeah, and she eventually told me
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.140]   that he was not in the picture anymore.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.140]   So it was back and forth, back and forth.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.540]   Our senior year we were an item
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.780]   and I was just dreaming of the future.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.500]   But we didn't figure out that in those days
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.620]   if she went to college in Berlin
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.740]   and I went to college in Jena,
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.740]   and the distance between the two cities
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:07.460]   was too much for a weekend visit.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.860]   Public transportation was very slow
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.160]   and nobody had cars.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.820]   - So the circumstance of life, you drifted apart.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.260]   - Yeah, and so we interacted with a couple of letters
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.960]   and then I got the goodbye letter.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.020]   Oh my God.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.700]   - Did that hurt?
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.900]   - I can still feel it.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.540]   You know when--
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.700]   - That's a good thing that you could feel the pain.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.380]   That's still part of love.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.060]   The pain of loss is still part of love.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.740]   And then you kind of change that, you shape it,
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.540]   and you give that love in deeper,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.740]   more profound ways to future people.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.780]   - That's very well put.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:51.380]   But at the time it emptied me out.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:56.380]   If I had a tendency to have suicidal thoughts,
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.020]   I might have killed myself.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.420]   - Would you say that was one of the darker moments
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.260]   of your life?
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.580]   - Let me see.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.060]   As a single moment, yes.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.060]   So I still remember, we had a mail slot in the front door,
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.700]   and I was expecting a letter any day,
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.660]   and there was the letter.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:25.120]   I go upstairs into my bedroom and I open it and I read it.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.020]   And it was just like the life went out of me.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.340]   - You're just there alone,
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.620]   and you have to experience this pain alone.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.460]   - So, but--
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.300]   - And now you're deeply alone in this world.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.140]   - Yes, because I didn't have a,
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.840]   there was no emotional relationship with my parents.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.700]   I literally had nobody.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:51.420]   - So this love you have in you had no place to go.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.420]   - It was choked off, all right?
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.220]   But what I did was I,
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.740]   I wanted to go on, right?
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:07.540]   And so I threw myself into the study of chemistry.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:12.540]   I outworked all of my fellow students in a big way.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.180]   I just like, I worked my ass off,
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.500]   and since I was pretty smart too,
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.060]   I just aced practically everything.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.700]   And for the first two years in college,
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:23.740]   and look, we go to college,
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:24.820]   there are all these pretty girls,
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.040]   and there's dances and everything.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.420]   We had this great student club where,
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.100]   I didn't look at any girls.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.700]   Eventually I knew I was going to,
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.260]   wanna have female companionship,
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.780]   but love, uh-uh, no more, that hurts.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.220]   There's a song that goes, "Love hurts."
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.220]   - Yeah, yeah, I know that one.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.400]   That's true, there's actually many songs
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.180]   that have a similar message, yes.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:54.260]   So during that time, during your excellence,
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:58.040]   just being an exceptional student of chemistry,
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.120]   let's go to your story.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.280]   So in your book, "Deep Undercover, My Secret Life
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.920]   and Tangled Allegiances as a KGB Spy in America,"
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.700]   and in the really, really excellent podcast series
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.880]   that I've been listening to,
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.240]   people should definitely listen to it,
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.940]   it's called "The Agent,"
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.680]   you document your time as a KGB spy
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.260]   before, during, and after.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.880]   Can you tell the story of when you first were contacted
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   by the KGB, those, how you were invited,
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.160]   the offer to join was made?
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.160]   - Well, it was a big surprise,
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.040]   and I never thought of myself as a potential agent.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.720]   You know, I was gonna be a tenured professor
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.960]   and join the ruling elite,
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.280]   because in Europe, tenured professors are few.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.960]   It's not like in the United States, you know,
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.600]   anybody who teaches at colleges has a title of professor.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.400]   - Easy now. (laughs)
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.160]   - It's true, it's not a criticism.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.000]   - 100%.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.920]   So we should also clarify that tenured professor or not,
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.640]   it is a very prestigious position
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.080]   throughout history of Europe.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:02.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   - I would say, especially communists,
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.680]   I don't actually know the full landscape of the respect,
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.400]   but at least in the Soviet Union where I grew up,
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.240]   it's a prestigious position.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.360]   - Absolutely was.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.440]   And the town of Yenna had about 100,000 people live there.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:22.360]   And I would, it's a wild guess,
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.920]   but maybe 30 tenured professors,
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.960]   and they were part of the ruling elite.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.800]   I was trying to do as much as I can
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.200]   to live the good life, right?
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   You know, have access to things that are nice.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.760]   - Yeah, but I think the powerful thing
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:43.000]   about being a professor in that context of East Germany
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.320]   is the prestige.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.360]   - And the feeling of superiority.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.600]   I was full of myself.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.800]   When you are the best of the best,
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.360]   and in my third year I received a scholarship,
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.520]   the Karl Marx scholarship,
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.520]   that was limited to 100 concurrent recipients in the country.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.840]   So my God, I was full of myself.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.960]   I believed in myself, hook, line, and sinker.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.000]   And I was also,
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   I got a lot of accolades from teachers and fellow students.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.880]   - They were feeding the ego, the old, I mean.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.720]   - Yeah.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.920]   - You have to believe in yourself often
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.220]   when you're young to truly, to excel.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.740]   And you sure as heck did.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.000]   - But you know, as a balance, you need a mentor,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.480]   somebody who puts things in perspective,
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.880]   and I didn't have one.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.720]   My father was a non-entity and nobody else.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.040]   They all looked up to me.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.880]   I was an up-and-coming guy, right?
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.200]   - So there's no father figure that put you in your place.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.040]   - Not at all.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.160]   And I give you one extreme example.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.380]   It was down the road when I fathered a child out of wedlock.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.840]   That was in my fifth year, I believe.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.000]   The Communist Party in East Germany was very moralistic.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.760]   If you did that, they would have a talk with you
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.320]   and give you whatever, severe reprimand.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.440]   Nobody even mentioned a word about this.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.280]   So yeah, so this is how this ego gets nurtured.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:25.240]   But anyway, getting back to how the KGB came in contact.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:30.000]   So they most likely got knowledge of me
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.080]   by looking at Stasi records.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   - What's Stasi?
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.680]   - Oh, that was East German Secret Police,
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.180]   Staatssicherheit, security for the state.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.960]   - There's that word security again.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.480]   (laughing)
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.240]   - And they pretty much kept a record
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.280]   on everybody in the country.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.980]   And so when you look through this,
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.860]   and this is what the KGB was looking for.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.680]   They were looking for candidates,
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.240]   particularly for this kind of job
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.760]   that they had in mind for me,
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   for candidates who were not in their mid-20s,
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.800]   who were not fully developed yet,
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.860]   but mature enough to get there.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.160]   And still young enough, right?
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.400]   - 'Cause at that level of maturity,
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   you can test whether they can handle this kind of job.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.520]   - Yes, absolutely right.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.960]   So and one day I got a knock on my door
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.180]   and my dorm room door was on a Saturday.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:36.680]   And they knew that I was by myself.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.320]   How did they know it?
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.220]   We had a, I pieced this together.
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:47.680]   We had an exchange student from the Soviet Union
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.000]   and he was next door to me.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   And he befriended me, so he got to know me a little bit.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.480]   And the pattern was that my roommate
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.520]   would always go home for the weekend.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.560]   And of course they also knew which door to knock on,
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.400]   even though there were no nameplates, right?
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.400]   So somebody knocks and I knew it was a stranger
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.240]   because if it had been a student,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.760]   the pattern was that we would knock on the door
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.720]   and then go in.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.880]   We wouldn't wait for somebody to let us in.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:26.880]   So I waited for 10 seconds and he didn't come in.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.500]   I knew that it was a stranger, I said, "Come on in."
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.520]   And in came a person who spoke fluent German.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.480]   So that was not a KGB guy.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.120]   It was a collaborator.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.280]   And so he started making a bunch of small talk.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.280]   He introduced himself as a representative
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.960]   of Kaltseiss Jena, which was the optics company
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:56.400]   that made really, really good optical instruments.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   Was one of the best in the world.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   - So it's like the super prestigious company in that place.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.800]   - Right, and he said that he was a representative
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.400]   of that company and he would just wanna find out
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.360]   what my plans were after graduating from college.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:21.280]   And at that point I knew he wasn't from Kaltseiss Jena
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.840]   because in those days there was no recruitment.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.920]   When you were done, if you were in the top 10%
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.280]   of the graduates, you would most likely pick
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.580]   to stay and get a doctorate, right?
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.240]   And the rest of them were assigned.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.600]   You had no choice.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.280]   So that guy was an idiot.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.720]   He didn't know the basics about--
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.160]   - You interviewed him a little bit to understand--
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.280]   - Oh sure, I started--
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.400]   - Like feel out, is this guy full of shit?
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.600]   Because yeah, he's a stranger showing up to your dorm room.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.520]   I knew that, at that point I knew he was Stasi,
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.440]   which is wrong, but it doesn't matter
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.320]   because he was German and I had no idea
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.080]   that the KGB would be involved.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.320]   - So sorry to pause briefly.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.960]   Did you have a sense, did people know
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.320]   that there's a Stasi type of organization,
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.320]   that there's a large number of people doing this kind
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.280]   of work in East Germany, in order for you to make that guess?
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.440]   - Yeah, we knew that the Stasi existed.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:35.440]   We even had our James Bond, we had a series
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:41.080]   called the Invisible Visor, where a Stasi employee
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   in East Germany would go into West Germany
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.920]   and hunt down Nazis.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.400]   So yes, the Stasi was known to be there.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.960]   - And admired in part, or feared, or both?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.040]   - I thought they were necessary and I admired them.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.160]   - James Bond.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.080]   - Yes, the reason I did so, because I had no information
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.880]   to the contrary, I never knew anybody personally
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.880]   or even somewhat removed who was followed by the Stasi,
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:19.280]   was put in jail, I had no clue.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.800]   I had no clue that they did a lot of damage
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.480]   and that they were doing a lot of surveillance
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.120]   of the East German population, the same way the KGB
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.120]   did for the Soviet Union.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:34.320]   So for me to be talking to somebody from the Stasi,
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   it raised my interest, I was curious what comes next,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.240]   because I sort of knew something interesting
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.920]   would be coming at me, and I had no other thoughts
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.080]   about that at that point.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:54.000]   So when he was finally, when he went for the kill
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.240]   by reversing himself, he said, "You know, I gotta tell you
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.280]   "that I really am not from Karl Zeiss,
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.080]   "you know, I'm from the government."
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:05.400]   Okay, thank you for pointing that out.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.880]   And then he asked this question, he says,
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.800]   "Can you imagine to one day work for the government?"
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.360]   And so I gave a pretty clever answer, I said,
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.600]   "Yes, but not as a chemist."
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.520]   So I answered the question that he didn't ask,
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.200]   I helped him out.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:28.160]   So we made an arrangement to meet for lunch,
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.320]   which in Germany is the main meal,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.920]   at the number one restaurant in Vienna.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.040]   I still remember what I ate.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:36.880]   - What was that?
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.800]   - Rump steak with butter on top, and French fries,
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.120]   it was my favorite.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:46.200]   Anyway, so when I get to the restaurant,
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.600]   I saw this fellow sitting in the back there at the table,
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.440]   and there was another person at the table.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.920]   So I was a little bit hesitant,
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.440]   because in those days, it was not unusual
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.440]   for perfect strangers to share a table,
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.600]   'cause there wasn't enough tables and chairs and so forth.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.920]   So I didn't know if I could approach him,
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.760]   but he got up and came to me,
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.800]   and he took me to the table, and he said,
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.960]   "I want to introduce Herman,
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:18.220]   "we work with our Soviet comrades."
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.040]   Aha, KGB.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.720]   And then he disappeared, he says,
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.120]   "I got something else to do."
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:28.540]   I never knew his name, he just handed me over to the KGB.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:32.200]   - What was the relationship between the KGB and the Stasi?
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.440]   As collaborators, close collaborators,
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.640]   or just distant associates?
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.600]   - They were pretty close collaborators,
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.800]   as I told you that they bought forged documents
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.720]   that the Germans made,
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.880]   because the Germans were better at forgery.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.040]   They also exchanged information,
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.960]   but they didn't trust each other 100%,
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:55.920]   and I tell you why I know that.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.600]   So they recruited me to send me to West Germany.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.240]   As I already said, East Germany had 1,000 agents over there,
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.800]   why would they wanna have their own?
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.060]   - Yeah, yeah, okay, this is a fascinating
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.360]   internal and external dynamic of distrust.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.360]   - Yeah. - Okay, so there you are,
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:21.560]   welcomed by the KGB, when did the offer, the invite come?
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.600]   - Well, that took a while.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:27.320]   So Herman and I had an unofficial relationship
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.880]   for about a year and a half.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.700]   I would meet him maybe once a week,
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.200]   once every two weeks, initially in his car,
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:40.200]   but then he took me to a conspirational flat
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:45.720]   that was an apartment that was occupied
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:50.240]   by a party member, a lady, single lady.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.680]   When we came in, she would leave,
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.160]   she left us tea and cookies,
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.000]   and then we could freely talk.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.960]   He also, at that time, gave me some
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.640]   West German literature magazines to read,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.600]   which was, of course, forbidden.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.200]   So already I'm starting to feel somewhat special.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.640]   And as we were talking about what they had in mind
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:15.040]   for me in general, I knew that I was gonna be
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.920]   even more special because I would be above the law.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:23.720]   I would operate outside the law of the countries
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.000]   I would go to, as well as East Germany,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   because the magazines, and eventually when I joined up,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.200]   they told me I had better watch West German television,
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.920]   which was also not explicitly prohibited,
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.920]   but it was something that could get you in trouble.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.080]   - So on many levels, you're super special.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.400]   You're the James Bond. - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   - So what was that recruitment testing process like?
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.840]   Testing whether you have what it takes to be a KGB agent?
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:06.280]   - First of all, we had very in-depth talks,
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:12.440]   Herman and I, about life.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:17.440]   And I still am very honest and sharing my feelings.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:21.200]   - Philosophical or personal?
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.800]   - Personal. - Personal.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.300]   - I even told him that I was shy around the girls.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:29.560]   - He was giving you relationship advice, or what?
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.400]   How old was he?
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.640]   So what was the dynamic?
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.040]   Can you tell me, was it a father, son?
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.080]   - No, older brother. - Older brother.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.560]   - Yeah, he was maybe in his early to mid-30s,
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.320]   and I was maybe 10 years younger.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.800]   - And what languages did he speak?
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.520]   - He spoke German pretty well.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.320]   - But he's originally from Russia?
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.820]   - Yeah, with a Russian accent.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:54.320]   So I got in trouble one time with him when I asked him,
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.980]   is your real name German?
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.080]   He didn't like that. - He didn't like it.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.840]   Was he good with girls?
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.120]   - No, no, I remember what he told me.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.280]   He says, you know, you gotta understand one thing.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.760]   They're looking for guys too.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.560]   That's all.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.720]   - Girls are looking for guys too.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.800]   - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah, it's a competitive game.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.440]   - Yeah, don't worry about it, don't be so shy.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.920]   - So that little flame of love that we talked about,
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.240]   in all the shapes that it takes in our life,
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.840]   did he talk to you about that,
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.520]   that that could be taken advantage of,
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   that that could be used, or was it implied?
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   - Yeah, but it was not very focused, not in great detail.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:41.520]   So we talked about personal stuff, and dislikes.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.240]   He gave me tasks.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.880]   For instance, when my friend and I hitchhiked
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.280]   from East Germany all the way down to Bulgaria,
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.160]   he told me to write a report about it, what I saw.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:57.840]   So fundamentally, he wanted to see how well I can write,
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.900]   and how well I can report, how well I observe.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:06.560]   He also asked me to write some profiles
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.120]   about fellow students.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.040]   I don't believe that was for them to give him to the Stasi.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.640]   It was just like, how well do I characterize people?
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.440]   That's important when you're talking about,
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.480]   when I was in the US, active in the US,
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.220]   I operated as a spotter, so I did exactly that.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.380]   I wrote profiles about people.
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:31.160]   He also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:38.040]   He would give me an address and a name
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.520]   of the people who lived at the address.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:46.160]   And he told me to go there, ring the doorbell,
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.960]   and find out something about a relative
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.280]   who lived in West Germany.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.920]   That is undercover exploration, right?
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.800]   So you go, you make up a story,
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.160]   and somehow win the confidence of your target
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.400]   to tell you something that you wanna know.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.960]   - Did that come naturally to you?
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.000]   - No, no, I hated it.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.760]   - The charisma involved?
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.600]   Which part did you hate?
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.300]   - Yeah, charisma, I think, I didn't know that I had it.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.140]   (laughs)
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.960]   - It took you some time to discover.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.440]   - Because, you know, I always was,
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.060]   and I still am, to some degree, a bit shy.
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:24.040]   I lost a lot of the shyness after moving to the South,
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.100]   because, here in the United States,
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:29.400]   because you don't have to be shy, you know?
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.360]   (laughs)
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.560]   - You can let your love shine.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.880]   - That's exactly right.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:38.880]   But anyway, I hated doing that, but I did it well.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.940]   I still remember, so I, in those days, I had a beard,
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.960]   and I rang the bell, and--
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.200]   - Tall, handsome fellow?
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.040]   - Yeah, and I looked the part,
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:54.440]   I said, "I'm a sociology student, and I'm doing a survey."
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.280]   And I asked a whole bunch of questions,
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.840]   "Would you like to answer the questions?"
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.600]   "No problem."
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:04.120]   And then I directed the conversation
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.760]   to the lady's private life,
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.960]   and she actually gave me information,
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:13.600]   she volunteered information that I wanted to know.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.420]   - Beautiful.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.080]   - I did well, and the other one that I didn't like,
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.880]   but I also did well with,
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.280]   when Herman drove me around the city
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.060]   and showed me a building, and he said,
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:28.520]   "Find out what organization is in there, what they do,
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.820]   "and maybe get to know some people."
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.400]   And I did that pretty well also.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:38.900]   You have to be inventive to come up with a cover story,
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:43.900]   and I've always been quite inventive.
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:48.560]   I'm a storyteller at heart, and I didn't know it then,
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.820]   but--
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.900]   - But there was still something unpleasant about it.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:52.740]   - Yes, yes.
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:53.780]   - Which part was unpleasant?
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.700]   - Well, the shyness, and then,
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.020]   I wasn't very comfortable lying.
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:01.140]   I became comfortable down the road,
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:05.580]   but I was brutally honest,
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:10.080]   and never hid anything of me.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:16.740]   But over time, you lose that uncomfortable feeling,
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:22.460]   and you rationalize that you gotta do it.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:23.740]   There's only one way, right?
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.460]   And you're serving a good cause.
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.180]   - So you were talking to Herman for a year and a half?
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.220]   - A year and a half.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.300]   - And then, how did that progress?
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:36.020]   - Yes, so he finally, I guess he sent a report
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.380]   to headquarters in Berlin,
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:42.020]   and then he sent me on a three-week
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:45.900]   quote-unquote practice trip to Berlin.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   This was the first time when I had a conspiratorial meeting,
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:55.940]   where I had an address and a time and a code phrase,
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.980]   and I met another agent.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.220]   His name was Boris.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.820]   These names were meaningless.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.740]   They were all cover names, right?
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.340]   - So what was the code, and the meaning?
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:08.540]   What was then, can you give a little more detail?
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.260]   - That code, I don't remember.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.140]   - Not the code, but what do you mean by code?
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:13.980]   So what was--
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:17.500]   - I tell you, the code we used when I met,
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.620]   while I was active,
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:23.140]   I would approach the other person who I thought
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.340]   may be the person I wanna meet.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:30.340]   We both had something with us or on us
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:34.000]   to make us more likely to be the right person.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.280]   And I would ask him the following questions.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:43.980]   Excuse me, I'm looking for Susan Green.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.820]   And he would answer, yes, you must be David.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.660]   Stupid.
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:54.100]   If I ask a stranger, they would look at me.
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:56.340]   How could I help you?
[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.580]   So I know it's the wrong guy.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.060]   - It's just a low probability
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.540]   that the right thing would be said.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.140]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.300]   - And it seems like a safe statement
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.780]   if it's not the right person.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.620]   - Exactly right.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.740]   - It would just come off absurd or crazy or whatever.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.540]   - You would have made a good secret agent.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.380]   You know exactly--
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.380]   - How do you know I'm not?
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.140]   (laughing)
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:18.140]   We'll discuss this.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:21.340]   I'm dressed like one.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.740]   Actually, yeah, were there any dress code?
[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.660]   - No, just fit in.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.700]   - Fit in, no matter what.
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.420]   And then be creative.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:30.580]   - Yes. - Figure out ways to fit in.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.660]   - Right.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.580]   So anyways, he gave me some tasks
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:38.100]   and we, and he, since I had rented a room in a house,
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.460]   he gave me Western literature to read.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:45.220]   And we spent time together.
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:51.900]   And there was a practice run to West Germany.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.860]   Actually, there were two.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.540]   And that was very important.
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.460]   In hindsight, I figured that out.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:06.540]   So I traveled to West Germany, no, not to West Berlin
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.620]   with an East German passport that was stamped
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.300]   that that individual was allowed to go to the West.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.020]   And there was a part of the border
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:23.020]   that was only guarded by Soviet troops.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.300]   And that's where they smuggled me into West Germany.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:31.300]   I got on the subway and then appeared in West Berlin.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:37.820]   No Americans, no Brits, no French knew that I had entered.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.460]   - Forged documents or not?
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.860]   - No, no, this was an East German passport.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:42.700]   It was real.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.740]   - Okay. - Okay.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.940]   So, and the first trip, all they wanted me to do
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:51.020]   is just walk around, smell the air,
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.540]   have a beer or whatever and eat a sausage and then come back.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.340]   The second trip, I had a task,
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:04.100]   very similar to the one that I had back in Jena,
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:08.100]   to ring the doorbell someplace and talk to some people.
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.460]   And that worked very well also.
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.700]   - I should mention that you talk about that,
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.580]   you know, eat a sausage, drink some beer.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.940]   I suppose that's a good test too,
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:23.420]   to see how you behave under Western,
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.740]   like when first introduced to the Western culture.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:29.860]   Like, this is why I might not make a good agent,
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:34.340]   is when I first came to the United States in the supermarket
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:38.980]   I like bananas, as many bananas as I wanna eat.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:44.060]   That, I think that would break me.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:44.900]   - It's a shock.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:48.860]   - Just, it's a shock to have access to Western culture.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.860]   You're getting very close to the reason
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:55.860]   they actually made me do these two practice trips.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:01.100]   When I first emerged on West Berlin territory,
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.860]   I felt highly uncomfortable.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.260]   That was the enemy, right?
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.540]   And I saw the cops everywhere,
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:11.300]   and even those cops had like light blue uniforms,
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.460]   not the, they weren't standouts.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.460]   So I was wondering, you know, if they knew that,
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:18.900]   you know, I had like KGB on my forehead.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.260]   - So you were paranoid that they would know,
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.100]   they would see.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:24.020]   - I was scared, but I overcame that.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.620]   - So that's, can we just linger on that?
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.700]   Because I suppose that's a natural,
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.540]   like if I give anybody on the street the mission
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:35.580]   to do the mission you had to do, is they would be paranoid.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.300]   That's a natural human feeling is,
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.120]   am I being watched, do they know?
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.300]   Like if you try to steal something from a store,
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.620]   there's going to be a feeling like,
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.180]   are they watching me, are the cameras watching,
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.020]   are the people watching me,
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.900]   they all know, that kind of stuff.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.740]   So you have to overcome,
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.860]   or you have to be somehow rugged and robust
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.500]   to that kind of feeling in order to overcome it.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.700]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:02.780]   So, and something very interesting happened
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.660]   while I was being trained in Berlin.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:07.540]   I met a classmate of mine from high school,
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:12.460]   and he confided to me that he was recruited by the Stasi
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.260]   to become a spy, go as a spy to West Germany.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.060]   And he also had this practice trip,
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.620]   and he peed in his pants.
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.580]   He went back and told him, I can't do that.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.980]   - Just from the terror, the-- - Yes.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.100]   - That paranoia.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:30.820]   - Now this guy's career was over.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:35.820]   He had an engineering degree, he was a pretty smart guy.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.680]   He was just for the rest of his life,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.820]   and he's still alive I believe,
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:45.660]   floating around and trading in model railroads
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.500]   and stuff like that.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.220]   - You mean, do you think that experience broke him?
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.180]   - No, they wouldn't let him back in.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.020]   - Oh, I see.
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.540]   They, oh.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:54.380]   - Yeah.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.820]   - So it's a test that if you fail, you pay the price.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:01.820]   - I had no idea that something bad would happen
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.820]   if I failed that test, but I didn't.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:04.980]   - Yeah.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:05.820]   - I didn't fail.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:10.120]   So, and this led then to the offer, all right?
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.040]   And after, you know, Boris was happy with me,
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.240]   and he told his boss, who was most likely
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.520]   the head of the KGB in East Berlin,
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.800]   and I had an appointment to meet--
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.160]   - In East Germany.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.760]   - Yes, in East Germany, yeah, all of East Germany.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.520]   - Yes. - That's right.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.660]   An appointment to meet with him,
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:35.400]   and as we walk into the room, there was this huge desk
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.760]   and a little guy sitting behind it.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.760]   Very, very, just like little and unimpressive.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.960]   - Nice.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.800]   - A lot of paraphernalia, like, you know,
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.560]   had a bust of Dzerzhinsky on his desk
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:56.140]   and some paintings, Lenin and so forth.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.020]   But when the guy opened his mouth,
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.780]   he went like, whoa.
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:06.200]   Huge psychological energy.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.120]   He spoke only Russian.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.960]   Now, and initially he would, you know,
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.480]   start the bat with five minutes worth of propaganda,
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.960]   why we're doing what we're doing.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.360]   I didn't need that.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.320]   I understood most of it, but when I didn't understand,
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.320]   I'd ask Boris to translate.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.680]   And then he sprung it on me, and I was not prepared.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.580]   He said, "So what, are you in or not?"
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:34.780]   And I was, no, I hadn't made up my mind.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.580]   I wasn't expecting that would come.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:42.600]   So I said to him, "I'm not really trained.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.920]   "You know, there's a lot of things I need to learn."
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.000]   And I came up with a couple of really stupid things.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.280]   One, not so stupid, but the other one was,
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.960]   I don't know why I said that.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.800]   I said, for instance, I need to learn how to drive a car
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   and to type with a typewriter.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.320]   And he got really annoyed and he said,
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.840]   "Don't worry about it, we'll train you.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.340]   "But I gotta tell you, we need people who are decisive.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:11.340]   "So you got until tomorrow noon to give Boris your decision."
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:14.340]   That made for a sleepless night.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.220]   - So what was going through your mind?
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:22.220]   - Well, I had, this was almost 50/50.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:26.940]   I knew I was gonna have a huge career, a good career.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:31.940]   I was on my way because I was already employed
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.120]   by the university as an assistant professor.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.680]   - So that career would be to become a professor,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.360]   become a 10-year professor, be a world-class.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.600]   - Yes, Jena had become my hometown.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.080]   I really loved the place.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.300]   It was my oyster.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:52.300]   And my family was my basketball team.
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.200]   I was--
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.680]   - You love playing basketball.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.920]   - Oh, absolutely. - So that's what you mean.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.000]   Yeah, so this is home.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.720]   This is home, this is where your love is.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.120]   - This was home.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.800]   - Did you understand that the choice involved leaving
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.920]   the home behind? - Yes, yes.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.360]   And the one thing I didn't have,
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.860]   the two things I didn't have,
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:13.640]   an emotional relationship with my mother,
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.960]   and I didn't have a steady girlfriend at the time.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.880]   - I think Freud would have a lot to say about that,
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.920]   but yeah, go ahead.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920]   But the connection between those two, but yes.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.200]   (Roger laughs)
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.300]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.200]   - By the way, my friend, Guntante,
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.960]   the one who worked for the Stasi,
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.240]   was also, the Stasi tried to recruit him as an agent,
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.480]   but he had a love relationship at the time,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.880]   and he said politely, "No, I won't, I can't."
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.840]   - So you didn't have, that's the one thing
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.000]   that really could-- - Would have helped me.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.200]   - Would have held you to this place's love.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.020]   - So you got the career on the one hand,
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.160]   my basketball team, the town that I would be part
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.440]   of the ruling elite of, and then we had this great adventure
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.440]   and the ability to contribute to the victory,
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.800]   the worldwide victory of communism,
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.600]   and stick it to the Nazis, and of course,
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.280]   the feeling that you're really special.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.640]   - Yeah, James Bond.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.480]   - Yeah.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.840]   - What's, (laughs)
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.020]   the question, do I wanna be a tenure professor
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:14.960]   or James Bond?
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.560]   - Yes, and-- - As funny as that sounds,
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.140]   that was probably a difficult decision.
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.420]   - It was a difficult decision, but fundamentally,
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:26.420]   it wasn't, and it wasn't my zeal to help the revolution.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:32.960]   It was my, what they called, what the Stasi was looking for,
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.960]   the KGB was looking for in a character
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.320]   that they would send over, a well-controlled inclination
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.920]   to adventure, okay?
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.760]   (laughing)
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.960]   - Yeah, yeah, James Bond, what do you say?
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.880]   And the love of women, yeah.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.020]   - It was, (laughs)
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.240]   yes, I gotta put this in right here,
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.680]   because I'm telling people I have two things
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.700]   in common with James Bond.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.680]   These are my initials, JB,
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:07.380]   and I got the girl too, three times.
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.960]   (laughing)
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.120]   - Yeah, I mean, and that's adventure.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.400]   - Yeah, and the ability to travel to the West,
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.860]   because the West was closed off to us.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.520]   We could go to foreign countries,
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.840]   but they all had to be communist countries.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.140]   You know, I wanted to see Paris,
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:28.140]   because I had fallen in love with Honoré Balzac,
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:34.880]   who wrote a phenomenal set of novels that I just ate up.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.700]   And so when I eventually did go to Paris,
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.240]   I knew all the places already,
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.700]   because he described them all.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.200]   But anyway, so that one, it was 51-49,
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.440]   but eventually, when you do the side-by-side
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.820]   intellectual comparison, that doesn't work.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.580]   It becomes a tie, and then you just go with your gut,
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.000]   and I said, "Hey, I'm in."
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.440]   - So now that you successfully passed the test,
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.500]   and you were sitting with this unimpressive man,
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.740]   and had the invite, and had to sleep on it,
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:15.880]   and have made the decision to join, what was next?
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.540]   - I was just told that I was being recruited
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.580]   by the State Department of East Germany,
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.060]   I was going to become a diplomat.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:27.100]   I must have had some paper, but I forgot,
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:31.380]   because just by saying so, that wouldn't have worked.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.980]   - There's some kind of document that says you can't--
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:33.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.780]   - And that was the only entanglement you had to that place.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.800]   No love, no, just the basketball.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.060]   - Basketball, giving up basketball was huge for me.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.220]   I loved playing that game.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:48.260]   I started playing basketball when I was 18.
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.620]   That's a little late.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:51.300]   - Are you better offensive, defensive?
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.500]   What do you like more?
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.980]   Do you like to shoot from a distance?
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.260]   Do you like to play up?
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.380]   - I was a runner.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:01.380]   I was very quick on my feet, and I was a good jumper, too.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:06.660]   I typically played the four position.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.140]   - What's that?
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.060]   - Forward.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.900]   - Oh, the forward position.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.900]   - Forward position.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:15.900]   But anyway, so that was the hardest for me to give up.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.860]   But the other thing that I remember I had to do
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.780]   to hand in my party document
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:25.140]   to the party secretary of the university,
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.740]   and he made a comment,
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.860]   "Yeah, we probably won't hear much about you,
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:33.260]   "but we know that you're gonna do something very important."
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:37.460]   So he sort of had an inkling that I'm gonna go
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:40.780]   someplace undercover or something like that.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:45.780]   And then I packed my bags and got on a train to Berlin
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:48.580]   for another one of those secret meetings
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:52.640]   with my new handler, Nikolai.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.220]   And here came another test
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.380]   that would have been quite easy to fail.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:06.260]   So I had lived in Jena for six years in a dorm.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:10.660]   Even when I became an employee of the university,
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.820]   they didn't have apartments.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:15.980]   I was still living in a dorm in a single room
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:18.300]   with a bed, a chair, and a table,
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.380]   and a toilet down the hallway.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.020]   So I figured, you know, Berlin KGB,
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.820]   I'm gonna get a nice apartment, right?
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.660]   And so Nikolai took me into his car,
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.020]   we started talking a little bit,
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.720]   and then he said, "I have a task for you already.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.860]   "Your first task is to find yourself a place to live."
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.240]   I mean, I don't think I showed it in my face,
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:48.240]   but my heart dropped like down into my pants.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.220]   I knew this was nearly impossible
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:55.060]   because there was a severe shortage of housing
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:58.800]   in everywhere in Germany, East Germany.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.120]   And all the apartments and homes
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.440]   were controlled by the government.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.540]   There were long waiting lists.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.700]   I knew couples that were promised
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:13.780]   maybe to get an apartment five years down the road.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:17.180]   So, and then they would postpone the decision
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.180]   to have a child.
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.820]   Anyway, this was impossible.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.560]   Well, you know, but this was a test.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.660]   Because I had to be inventive.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.100]   Now I had to figure out how to get out
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.860]   of an impossible situation.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.560]   I didn't realize it then at all.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.580]   I just went with the flow, you know?
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.160]   What do I do?
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.700]   So what I did, I went, I took the train,
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:46.360]   the city train to the very last stop,
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.300]   a little town called Aachner.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.160]   And I wandered around in that town
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.420]   and knocked on doors and asked people
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:56.840]   if they knew where somebody might have a place to live.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.060]   And after a couple of hours,
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.820]   somebody said, "There's this lady that,"
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:02.460]   and they gave me the address.
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.260]   And I talked to the lady and she said,
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:08.860]   "I happen to have a place where you might be able to stay."
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.340]   It was an outbuilding.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:13.900]   I don't know what it served.
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.500]   It was not a garage, it was concrete.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.340]   And it had a bed and a chair,
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:25.820]   running cold water, and a stove, a cold stove.
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:28.020]   That was going to be my--
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.540]   - Pretty basic, pretty basic.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.380]   - Pretty basic?
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:31.620]   Are you kidding me?
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.780]   - That's the--
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:35.260]   - Toilet across the yard, of course.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.300]   - Yeah, well, all the essentials.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.220]   What are you complaining about?
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.260]   So you were right.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:40.500]   (both laughing)
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.820]   You had to run the,
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.380]   James Bond had to run a special operation
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.860]   out of the outhouse.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.380]   - Yes, to my credit, and I think that
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:54.060]   established part of my reputation,
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.860]   I didn't complain at all to Nikolai.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.540]   - That was part of the test, probably.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:01.060]   - Yeah, I just told him, "I found something."
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.980]   And so, for six months, I would get up in the morning,
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:09.180]   get on the train, and walk around in the city,
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:14.180]   did some operational stuff, operational training.
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.060]   I went to the library, did a lot of reading in the library.
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.580]   And then I found a basketball team that I could join,
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.380]   so at least I could take a shower twice a week.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:28.740]   And apparently,
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:33.620]   it took about six months that I was still on probation,
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:37.060]   because after six months, Nikolai, one day,
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.540]   we were still meeting in his car,
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:42.220]   he handed me a key, and he said,
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.380]   "I'm gonna take you to your new apartment."
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:51.100]   Now, and I didn't know this, now I was really in, okay?
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:54.780]   Imagine the hurdles you have to jump over,
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:56.860]   and how many times you can fail, but you know.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:00.300]   - But not complaining, not asking questions.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.220]   - Yes.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.420]   - I mean, that was something you've written about,
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.220]   I think you wrote that bosses do not like
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.260]   to hear complaints or problems, they prefer solutions.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.100]   - That's right.
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.340]   - So what was your interaction like with the bosses?
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:17.340]   Does that essentially represent
[01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:19.900]   the way it went forward as well?
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:20.740]   - Yeah, I--
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.180]   - No complaints, get to solve the problem.
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:25.580]   - No complaints, no arguments, no, I know this better.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   I was taking it all in.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:30.900]   Now, the technical guys, they taught me something
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.400]   I didn't know that made sense.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.900]   What Nikolai, some of the stuff that he taught me
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:42.400]   was somewhat questionable, he was a generalist,
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.660]   and there's some things he didn't know really well.
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.740]   So I could have asked, probed a little bit, but I didn't.
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.820]   So I just played along.
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:54.380]   So this new apartment was, it was a studio,
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.900]   it had a kitchen with running cold water,
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:03.100]   and the bathroom was just one flight down the toilet,
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.620]   not a bathroom, one flight down the stairs.
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.540]   - It's an upgrade.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.220]   - It was a big upgrade.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.300]   And he gave me, I think he gave me
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.360]   a thousand mark to buy furniture.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.340]   And in that place, actually I also bought a TV
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:19.060]   and started watching West German television.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:24.060]   So I finally had a decent place to stay.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:30.060]   And my training in Berlin took about two years.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:34.300]   - What was the training, what were the interesting aspects
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:35.340]   to the training?
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.300]   What were sort of, if you do an overview systematic
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.780]   of what was the training process, what was difficult,
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:43.340]   what are some insights that generalize
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:46.860]   to the training process of what it takes to be a KGB spy?
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:50.460]   - Right, so let me start with the tradecraft.
[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:55.080]   So I was taught Morse code, that took a while.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:01.940]   I was instructed in how to use a shortwave radio
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:06.940]   and to receive the shortwave transmissions with Morse code.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:13.900]   I was taught an encryption and decryption algorithm,
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:15.420]   manual algorithm.
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:16.260]   - Yep.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:20.300]   - You might be interested that eventually I figured out
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.220]   at least one of the patterns.
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:28.220]   The algorithm was such that, and this was all about digits.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:32.820]   And the algorithm was such that in the end,
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:37.820]   the digits that were used to decipher other digits
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:42.060]   that were sent to me by a shortwave radio,
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:46.040]   there were, let's say if there were 100 digits,
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.380]   there were an equal number of ones, twos, threes,
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:51.600]   fours, fives, six, and seven, and up until zero.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.460]   And I was told that these algorithms,
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:00.020]   these manual algorithms were good for about 300 uses.
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:03.140]   After that, they could still be deciphered.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:06.860]   I'm assuming nowadays that wouldn't take as much.
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.900]   - Yeah, with computers for sure.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.900]   But there's probably, they're probably designed
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:13.740]   in a way that you can manually,
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.860]   sort of it's efficient and convenient to use them manually.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.700]   - Well--
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:22.300]   - It's not to optimize cryptographic security,
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.220]   it's to optimize, it's like to balance security
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.180]   and humans being able to actually--
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.620]   - Yeah, no, I gotta disagree.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.700]   It was neither efficient nor convenient.
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:31.540]   - Okay.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:32.420]   - It took a long time.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:33.620]   - So it wasn't deciphered.
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:37.160]   - When what was significantly easier to do,
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:40.140]   but that would require you to have
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.860]   spy paraphernalia with you.
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:44.580]   This is what's called a one-time pad.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:48.900]   So you have the set of numbers on a sheet of paper
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.220]   that had to be developed.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:54.900]   I had to use iodine to make those numbers visible.
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:58.900]   Those are known to be unbreakable
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.020]   unless they are used multiple times,
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:03.260]   the same sheet of paper.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:06.180]   Because the person who encrypts has the same set of numbers
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.540]   as the person who decrypts.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:13.540]   And one-time use, you cannot figure out what the message is.
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:15.380]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:17.220]   But this is a quick way to communicate
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.780]   from one person to another one time.
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:23.980]   - Well, one time, I had a pad with multiple sheets of paper.
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:27.020]   And the reason that they gave me a manual one
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:31.660]   is because I literally, I had only,
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.020]   when I wound up in the United States,
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:39.020]   I had only one thing with me that only a spy can have.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.100]   And that was a writing pad
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:46.280]   where the first 10 pages or so were impregnated
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.420]   with a trace of a chemical that was used for secret writing.
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:51.760]   But you really would have to know
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.100]   what you're looking for to, you know,
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:56.180]   you see this pad, it was bought at Walmart.
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.060]   - Can you explain a little further?
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:01.580]   What is the chemical here that, what are we talking about?
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.940]   So how, I don't understand how it's possible
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:07.140]   to have a physical pad that does the encryption
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.620]   without any computing.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:10.860]   I, how does it encrypt?
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:14.060]   - So, no, no, it doesn't do any work.
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:19.060]   So, the communication, the encrypted communication
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:24.580]   was a set of groups of five, five digits,
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:29.620]   and then another five, and there's always a gap in between.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:34.740]   And so let's say if I get this radio transmission,
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:37.900]   I write them all down, and then I use my,
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.540]   develop my algorithm, and then I do mathematics,
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:42.740]   either addition or subtraction.
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.860]   The resulting set of digits
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:48.700]   had, then had a one-to-one correlation to letters.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:51.100]   - And this is an easy way to then do the correlation.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.700]   - Yes, yes.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.540]   - Well, that's cool.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:56.320]   That's, and you're saying the algorithm was not efficient.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.160]   It was not--
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.980]   - Oh, the manual, it took a long time,
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.700]   and you can't make an error.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:05.220]   - Right, would you know where, can you,
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.800]   is it easy to debug?
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.960]   - No, you-- - No, you do it twice.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.460]   - You do it twice, and that's how you check.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.580]   - If it's identical, then you know.
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.780]   - But like, if it's not-- - If it's not,
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.940]   then one is right and the other is wrong,
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:16.780]   you gotta do it again. - So, you just
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:17.900]   don't make mistakes. - No, that's right,
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:19.440]   and I really didn't.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.180]   But anyway, so I was learning that.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:29.180]   I was also told that I was required
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:32.380]   to become proficient in another language,
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:35.940]   and they gave me a choice, and I picked English.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:37.180]   That's-- - What was the other one?
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:39.060]   - Oh, no, they gave me, pick one, French,
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.940]   you know, whatever is spoken in the West.
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:41.780]   - Got it.
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:44.260]   What would be second to you?
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.620]   Would you think French because of Paris?
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:49.260]   What would you, why English?
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:53.340]   - English was a no-brainer because I was a straight A
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:55.900]   student in English without studying.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:58.100]   It came so easily to me.
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.940]   So, that's why I chose it, right?
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.420]   So, that was that.
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:08.420]   Then I was taught the basics of counter-surveillance,
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:16.140]   you know, some trickery and surveillance detection routes
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:21.340]   where you wander around in a city for three hours
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:26.020]   and determine whether you're being followed or not.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:29.300]   That requires you to plan the route very well.
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:32.820]   I give you one example that will illustrate that.
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:37.660]   My favorite spot, when I was in Moscow,
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.500]   I did a lot of that also.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:45.500]   And my favorite spot was, it was a not well-traveled road.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:50.580]   It went down the hill and curved,
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:54.780]   and at the bottom of the hill, there was a telephone booth.
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:59.020]   And when you open the door and pick up the telephone,
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.500]   you have to look back.
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.940]   So, it wasn't like this, right?
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:03.060]   It wasn't a giveaway.
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.500]   This was normal, it was natural.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:08.940]   So, I could see if somebody would come walking after me.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:10.060]   You know, these kinds of things.
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:15.060]   Or you would use public transportation,
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:21.420]   big buildings where you needed to use an elevator
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:25.460]   and see who was, because surveillance,
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:28.740]   the object of surveillance is to never lose sight
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.900]   of the individual who you're surveilling,
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:34.020]   because at that point, you may miss the window
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.900]   where he does something that you're looking for.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.500]   So, somebody always has to come close, right?
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:44.780]   - Did you have to also study surveillance?
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:46.420]   - No, only counter surveillance.
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:50.820]   And what helped me, in all my training,
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:55.260]   you know, I would have a competition
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:57.780]   with the folks that were coming,
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:00.620]   that were following me, and me.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.980]   And I beat them every time.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.380]   They were at a disadvantage,
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:06.820]   because one of them always had to be close.
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.420]   And if you saw the same face twice,
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:11.640]   you knew that you were being followed.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.460]   And I had a very, very good memory for faces.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:18.140]   - So, basically, figure out a fixed route,
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:24.300]   and then a fixed route that allows you to survey the area,
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:28.740]   and then record the faces you've seen inside your mind.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:31.740]   And if you see multiple times a single face,
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:32.980]   that's a bad sign.
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:37.040]   - And they could use different clothes.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.700]   What they didn't have was face masks.
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.020]   The CIA does, nowadays.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.580]   They can give you a different face within seconds.
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.620]   Yeah. (laughs)
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:53.100]   - So, how... (laughs)
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:55.180]   I mean, again, you talk about paranoia.
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:27:02.340]   Is that a big part of the job?
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.860]   Counter surveillance?
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.860]   Like, being constantly paranoid that you're being watched?
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:09.020]   - Yeah, I was supposed to--
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.500]   - Isn't that quite stressful?
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.340]   So, is that one of the...
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:14.500]   Is that actually an effective way to operate?
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.140]   - No, but it sort of becomes a routine.
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:20.900]   I was told to do it while in the US, once a month.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:24.060]   - Okay, it's like a cleaning out.
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:26.260]   - Oh, not every day, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.940]   Once a month, or before I would, say,
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.900]   mail a letter with secret writing.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.940]   So, I was sure that nobody saw me
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:38.580]   put an envelope into a post box.
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:40.420]   - So, this is one of the tools in your toolbox.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:42.780]   So, there's Morse code, there's the decryption,
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:45.180]   and the encryption, there's the counter surveillance.
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.120]   - Photography.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.720]   Making micro dots.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.380]   You know what a micro dot is?
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:53.220]   Well, that's...
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:59.020]   You take a photograph,
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:03.100]   and you use a microscope in reverse,
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:07.480]   and make that photograph really small.
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.260]   So small that it's like the head of a pin
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:16.560]   that can be used to hide under a postage stamp.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:20.500]   In reality, I knew how to make 'em,
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:23.500]   but in reality, they never asked me
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.380]   to make use of that technique.
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:29.620]   - It's sort of an encryption mechanism for photographs.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.220]   - Yeah, so what we do nowadays,
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:36.220]   is embed code in PDFs and stuff like that, right?
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:37.860]   - Yeah, beautiful, okay.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:41.340]   All right, so that was a learning, a training process,
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.980]   both in the physical space, and sort of algorithmically.
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:46.820]   Is there other things?
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.820]   - Oh, you bet.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:51.780]   Interestingly enough, I was...
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:55.180]   The first book I was given to read
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:59.820]   was the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.220]   - Oh, so understand.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.220]   That's interesting, 'cause you said
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:04.700]   you had to read Western literature.
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:05.700]   - Yeah, that too.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.980]   - How much reading, so history,
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.420]   how much history, politics, geopolitics, culture?
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:15.540]   - Not much more, but they made me read that document.
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.740]   Other than that, I wasn't supposed
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:20.100]   to study the Soviet Union, I wasn't supposed.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.740]   And that was not, and I didn't,
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:24.780]   when they sent me to Moscow, it wasn't to learn Russian,
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:27.340]   right, it wasn't to learn English.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.060]   The second document they gave me
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.700]   was the Constitution of West Germany.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:35.900]   And then I got lots of magazines and stuff like that.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:38.540]   As I told you, I was also told to
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:42.100]   watch West German television,
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:46.980]   which I embraced with a vengeance,
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:49.700]   because it was better than East German.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:50.980]   So I would get up in the morning
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:52.100]   and have a little breakfast
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:55.500]   and watch the German version of Sesame Street.
[01:29:55.500 --> 01:30:02.020]   - And that helps you get an understanding of the culture,
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:06.580]   because if you have to do any kind of interaction,
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:09.020]   any kind of spying, then you have to be able
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:10.020]   to effectively integrate yourself.
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.620]   - Well, you also have to know,
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.420]   and that would've been easier
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:16.660]   if they had sent me to West Germany,
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:18.500]   you know, all the soccer teams,
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.180]   stuff that everybody knows.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.420]   When I came to the US, I knew very little stuff
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.900]   that everybody knows, that's why I had to be very cautious
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:27.700]   and take it in over time.
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.980]   Anyway, and the last thing I wanna mention is
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:36.660]   I was strongly encouraged to expand
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:40.460]   my cultural education.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:43.860]   In other words, go to visit museums,
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:48.860]   go to the theater, not so much movies, opera,
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:54.020]   read books from all kinds of authors.
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.060]   That was important to them.
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:58.260]   And once a month I had to write a report, what I did.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:02.900]   But the interesting thing, there was no curriculum,
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.300]   there was no agenda, there were no check marks.
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:06.660]   It was all ad hoc.
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:08.580]   Now you do this, and then you do that.
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:15.780]   And a lot of this also, they relied on my initiative.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:16.620]   Again.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.780]   - I mean, that's part of the evaluation too.
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:19.260]   - You bet.
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:20.500]   - Are you able to have creative,
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.740]   it's interesting that they're developing
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.580]   a James Bond type of character here,
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:27.780]   which is, what's the reason to go to the opera?
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.740]   As you become cultured in a certain kind of way,
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:34.380]   where perhaps that makes you more charming,
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.540]   more charismatic in terms of your ability
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:38.340]   to integrate yourself in different situations.
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:39.640]   - You're absolutely right.
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:45.980]   I was, when I came to the US,
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:50.540]   after about two years roughly,
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:57.340]   I was cultured enough to not make a bad impression
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:02.300]   at a diplomatic soiree in Washington, D.C.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.780]   I mingled freely.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:04.620]   - Yes.
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:05.460]   - All right?
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:08.660]   And so the whole idea was for me to sort of
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:12.540]   reach into the upper realms of society
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:17.200]   where the targets would be juicier than the worker bees.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.300]   - And how did you end up in Moscow?
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.620]   Why, how?
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.660]   What is that journey?
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:29.020]   - Well, so I told you, I started studying English.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.760]   So I started back from scratch.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:36.140]   They paid for a tutor, and I went from English 101.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.500]   I went through that in a couple of months,
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:43.140]   and then I got another guy with whom I expanded this.
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:46.680]   We had conversations rather than working from a textbook.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.660]   And I worked like a maniac.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.660]   I threw myself into the study of English
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:55.660]   like you wouldn't believe.
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:33:00.260]   And my inspiration came from Vladimir Lenin.
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:01.660]   I had read somewhere in a book
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:05.820]   that when Lenin was in exile, he studied German.
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:09.620]   And he learned 100 German words every day,
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:11.260]   new German words.
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.500]   So I started reading newspapers,
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:14.740]   and every word that I didn't know,
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:18.580]   I wrote down on an index card, German, English,
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.020]   and I piled them up.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:25.340]   And so I really learned 100 new English words every day.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.100]   I know this because I counted them.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:30.060]   And I had a system how to do this.
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:34.700]   So you take your index card, and you have five categories.
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.760]   That's a really good way to learn rote by rote.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.100]   So you got category one, that's the new ones,
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:43.220]   and you got category five.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:46.500]   So you start with five.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:50.260]   Five you already had right four times.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:54.700]   If you have it right again, it goes into the archive.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.980]   - Oh, like long-term cold archive, yeah.
[01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:01.620]   - Four, if you get it right, it goes to five.
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:04.020]   If you get it wrong, it gets relegated to three.
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.700]   And so you go through this,
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:13.100]   and occasionally I would throw the archive things
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.220]   back into one.
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:20.000]   So I really acquired a phenomenal vocabulary.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.260]   When I was done with my English,
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.260]   my vocabulary was significantly higher
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.440]   than the average American because I didn't discriminate.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.580]   Whatever word I didn't know, I learned,
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.460]   which is not necessarily the best way
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:35.060]   because English has a lot of synonyms, right?
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:35.900]   - Yeah.
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:39.420]   - And one synonym is usually the preferable one.
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:44.300]   And when I first interacted with people,
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:48.220]   I very often used the one that wasn't as good.
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:52.240]   And people found that I have an interesting way of talking.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.980]   They didn't know what that meant, but--
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:57.100]   - Yeah, so it builds a good foundation for a language.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.740]   It's getting a large vocabulary.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.140]   - Yes. - It's really interesting.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:02.380]   There's something I do which is called space repetition,
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:04.900]   which is a programmatic way of doing this kind of system
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:06.660]   that you've developed yourself,
[01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:10.780]   which is if you successfully remember a thing,
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.780]   it's going to be a longer time
[01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:14.300]   before it brings it up to you again.
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.140]   - Yeah.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:17.380]   - Now, that requires a computer
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.980]   to keep track of the information.
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.900]   If you have cars, that's a really interesting pile system.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:24.820]   One, two, three, four, five, you upgrade it.
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.380]   One, two, three, four, five.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.540]   Maybe I wouldn't go to the archive
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.140]   and go to pile one right away.
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:34.220]   Maybe I would go to, I don't know,
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:38.020]   pile five, perhaps, is probably the right place to put it,
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:40.500]   'cause you have to go through that full step again.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:44.140]   But that is a really powerful way to learn,
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:45.940]   definitely language, but also facts,
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.780]   like people that go to medical school--
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:48.620]   - Yes, disconnected facts.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.460]   - Yeah.
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.980]   - And you pretty much, when you're done,
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:53.220]   you know what you know.
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.060]   - Yeah.
[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:54.880]   - You don't have to-- - But then again,
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.460]   to use it, to integrate it into the music of language,
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.820]   that's more difficult, that's what you're talking about.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.140]   - Yeah, exactly right, exactly right.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:03.180]   - There's a charm, I mean, maybe it's not good
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:06.500]   for "Spycraft," but there's a charm to this kind of,
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:10.880]   to having an accent and using words incorrectly,
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.620]   but confidently, there's a,
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:15.700]   because language isn't a simple formula.
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.380]   Language is the play of words.
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:19.720]   So actually using the incorrect synonym,
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:28.060]   instead of saying I'm cold, saying I'm chilled,
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:31.540]   or something, like using offbeat words
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:33.140]   can actually be part of the charm.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.420]   So it's interesting, if you can learn
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:35.720]   how to use that correctly,
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:39.180]   'cause I know a bunch of people with a Russian accent,
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.300]   and I feel like they get away with saying
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.300]   a lot of ridiculous shit,
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:45.300]   because they're able to sort of leverage
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.500]   the charm of the non-sequiturs.
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.980]   - And by the way, by the way, just one thing,
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:53.220]   you talked about using a computer.
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:56.340]   When I had my first personal computer,
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:58.980]   I actually wrote a program that does that.
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:36:59.900]   - That does that.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.660]   By the way, when was that?
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:05.980]   'Cause you were a world-class programmer for a time,
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:07.780]   you were a very good programmer.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:08.620]   When did the--
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:11.060]   - First PC was probably 1984.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.660]   - 1984, when did you fall in love with programming?
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:16.140]   - When I went to college in the US,
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.620]   and part of the core curriculum was that you were required
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:22.220]   to take a course in computer,
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:24.780]   and it was mostly just talk,
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:27.260]   but we also had to learn a language.
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:31.260]   We had to write some programs in Fortran,
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:33.100]   which was what, five at the time?
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:37.260]   It was a dumbed-down Fortran.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.020]   But listen, so I see the ability,
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:44.380]   I see what you can do with this.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.380]   I programmed a sine curve,
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:50.140]   and then I divided the sine curve
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:53.060]   into really, really small rectangles,
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:54.780]   and then ran the program,
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:57.420]   and it came up with the right area.
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.740]   Wow, this is great.
[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:01.540]   - That's incredible, it's incredible.
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:02.780]   It's so powerful.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:07.140]   You're creating a little helper
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.660]   that helps you understand the world,
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:11.060]   to help you analyze the world, and so on.
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.580]   We'll return to that, 'cause it's interesting.
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.580]   You have so many interesting aspects to your life,
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:17.060]   but Moscow, so--
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:20.820]   - Yeah, no, let me, how I was sent to Moscow.
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:23.700]   Okay, so one day I had a visitor from Moscow,
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:27.260]   and he came to visit me in my apartment
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:31.460]   together with Nikolai, and we talked,
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:33.060]   and then he said, "So how's your English?"
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:35.580]   I said, "I pulled a book from the shelf,"
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:36.420]   and he says, "I can read that
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:38.620]   "without the help of a dictionary."
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:41.660]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:43.860]   And he said, "You know what?
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.140]   "We're gonna send you a tape recorder,
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:48.940]   "and you just talk, say something,
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:49.940]   "you know, for 20 minutes,
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:51.700]   "whatever you wanna talk about."
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:55.660]   They sent this thing, and two weeks later,
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:57.180]   I was on a plane to Moscow.
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:03.260]   Because I also spoke English,
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:05.580]   sort of the British variety of English,
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:07.700]   with not a strong German accent,
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.380]   because I've always had the ability
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:13.460]   to imitate others and sounds.
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.380]   It was an innate ability.
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:19.180]   I would, you know, when we were in a lab,
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:24.180]   and as students, I would very often do monologues
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:26.900]   imitating East German comedians.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:28.220]   You know, I just-- - Oh, like impressions.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:29.300]   - Yes, yes.
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:32.380]   I'm not good enough to make a living out of it,
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:37.380]   but that raised some interest,
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:40.180]   and so they sent me to Moscow.
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:42.780]   That was the first time on a plane, by the way.
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:46.300]   And I had a conversation with two ladies
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.140]   who spoke English.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:52.140]   One was a Russian professor at Lomonosov University,
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:55.060]   she was obviously KGB, that was her cover.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.780]   And the other one was an American-born lady.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:00.500]   - Oh, by the way, she was an actual professor,
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:01.540]   and you're using that as the cover,
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:03.540]   or is it just a story?
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:06.140]   - No, she said she was a professor.
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:07.940]   She may have taught there, too.
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.340]   - That's an interesting distinction.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:10.580]   - Yeah. - One is like a story
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:11.740]   you tell people. - No.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:14.180]   - And one is like you legit are doing the thing,
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:16.060]   but are also as a cover. - Yeah.
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:20.580]   - Anyway, that's an interesting aspect
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:22.820]   of how to be a good liar.
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.980]   You might as well live the lie.
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.620]   - Yeah, exactly right.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:30.660]   So, and the other one was a middle-aged,
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:31.780]   the Russian was pretty young,
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:34.340]   the other one was middle-aged American.
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:38.180]   And so we talked for maybe a couple of hours,
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:41.280]   and then they withdrew, and I was left alone.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.560]   Eventually, my liaison, he came back in,
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:49.920]   and he said, "It was close, but the American thinks
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.920]   "you can actually become, you get close enough
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.880]   "to becoming a native speaker of American English."
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:01.720]   And he said, "The Russian was very doubtful."
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:06.040]   And so, I think wishful, it was a tie, literally.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.000]   Wishful thinking prevailed.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000]   So, within a couple of weeks, I was moving to Moscow.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.400]   - And what was the task in Moscow?
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:21.900]   How long were you in Moscow? - Two years.
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:24.840]   - And what was the task there?
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:27.040]   Is it training, or is it espionage?
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.720]   - No, it was training.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:33.320]   So, it was, the American born became my tutor.
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.940]   I met with her twice a week.
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.160]   I also listened to a lot of BBC,
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.720]   shortwave BBC Worldwide.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.440]   I read more English books.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.040]   - So, a lot of that was about the language
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.600]   and the culture of English, American--
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:55.600]   - And I did phonetics exercises every night.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:03.040]   I had a tape that was about a half hour long,
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:06.340]   and they would say a word, and I would repeat the word,
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:07.660]   say a word, repeat the word.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:10.460]   And it was mostly about the vowels, by the way,
[01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:14.100]   most of the accent, and particularly,
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:17.260]   let's say, coming from German into English,
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:19.220]   but also Russian, it's the vowels.
[01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:20.560]   - Are we talking about the,
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:22.380]   so you would have a single word--
[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:23.380]   - A word. - Like apple,
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:24.980]   and you would just say apple.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:27.020]   - Yes. - And American English
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.860]   or British English? - No, American English.
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:33.860]   And I give you one example that almost nobody gets right,
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:36.400]   the difference between hot and hut.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.780]   You know what they're-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.620]   hot and hut, yeah.
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:43.100]   - And in German speakers, it's very tough.
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.140]   - You know which one, for everyone it's different.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:48.980]   For example, I could say this on a podcast,
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:51.260]   something that my brother struggles with,
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:53.900]   I struggled with too when I first came to this country
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.460]   to learn English, is there's differences,
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:58.860]   there's embarrassing differences,
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:02.180]   like beach and bitch, right?
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:05.020]   And you get so, as a young kid, also, you get so nervous,
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.720]   I don't wanna say the wrong thing.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:11.060]   I can also say that, this is almost a jokey thing,
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:15.620]   but there's a famous philosopher, Immanuel Kant,
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:18.980]   and you can guess which other word is very similar to that.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.320]   So there's a nervousness about,
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.640]   the what is that, that's interesting.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:29.560]   I mean, and Germans probably have a different tension
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.620]   of what is hard to learn,
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:33.820]   the difference between the pronunciation of the vowels
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:35.340]   or the control of the vowels.
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:36.500]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:39.420]   So you had to really master this daily exercise.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:41.580]   - And this was my discipline,
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:45.620]   I did this every night, routine, boring as hell.
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:47.660]   So English was the focus.
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:51.180]   And I also had interaction with some agents
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:54.500]   who had operated in the United States as diplomats
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:56.240]   on a diplomatic cover.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.160]   They would come and talk to me a little bit
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:03.080]   and tell me, and sort of prepare me what was ahead of me.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:05.640]   And then I did a whole lot of operational training,
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:09.020]   particularly surveillance detection, that was big.
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:11.740]   They also taught me how to drive a car in Moscow.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:13.880]   - Finally, the one skill you needed.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.600]   What's surveillance detection?
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:18.080]   - Okay, so this is when you find out
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.900]   whether you're being followed.
[01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:21.040]   - Ah, got it, got it, got it.
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.880]   So it's the antiserv, yeah, gotcha.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.680]   - The abbreviation that's used in--
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.080]   - Congress, yeah.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:31.320]   - Yes, in intelligence circles is SDR,
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.120]   surveillance detection route.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:35.680]   When they say that, you know what that is.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.400]   And that was it.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:42.400]   And a few other things, one-offs, for instance,
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:47.680]   I was once taught to read silhouettes of ships.
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:51.160]   When you see a ship from a distance,
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.680]   what kind of a ship it might be.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.960]   They thought this would come in handy, actually.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:02.960]   There was in 1982, Andropov started a campaign,
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.840]   it was, now I forget the name,
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.200]   Operation Something Something,
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:09.800]   where everybody who was in the West
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:12.320]   was supposed to look for signs
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.760]   that the West was getting ready for a war.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:21.760]   And everybody had an object to pay attention to.
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:26.920]   I had a harbor, a military harbor in New Jersey,
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:35.240]   near Red Bank, it was called Earl Weapon Station.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.420]   And the code name for that was early,
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:41.700]   so they asked me to just wander by there
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:45.000]   to see if there was something unusual going on.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.300]   Because the Soviet Union, at that point,
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:48.960]   it was Ronald Reagan, were really afraid
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:51.440]   that Reagan was gonna start a war.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:54.600]   They were absolutely, 100% afraid of him.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.680]   - Is there something memorable to you
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:59.920]   on a personal level, on a philosophical level,
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.860]   about your time in Moscow?
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:03.640]   Something that kinda stays with you,
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.520]   outside of the training stuff, maybe?
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.600]   Like the details of the training.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:08.900]   - You'll love the answer.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.160]   You will love the answer.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:14.680]   I was-- - You already guessed.
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.440]   - I was given tickets to two performances by Americans.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:23.680]   There was a theater troupe that played Our Town.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:27.160]   And then there was this, I forget the name of the guy,
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.440]   but you may not be old enough,
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.120]   have you ever watched Hee Haw?
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.720]   - Maybe.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.040]   - It was a country music show, real kitschy,
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.040]   but the star of Hee Haw was giving a concert
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.960]   in Moscow, and I guarantee you,
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:48.880]   at least half the audience were KGB.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:51.360]   (laughing)
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.480]   - Oh, man.
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.840]   - And at the other end,
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:47:01.760]   the opposite of a highlight was my visit
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:09.240]   to the mausoleum where Lenin is still today.
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:15.440]   That was so, that was a nothing.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:20.040]   He was my hero, but he looked like a wax figure.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:24.960]   And you walk by there, there was nothing inspirational.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.640]   It was not a religious experience, nothing.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.280]   It was a big old nothing.
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:35.080]   - Is that, did your faith and belief in communism
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:36.920]   start to crumble at some point here?
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:37.960]   - No. - Is that around,
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.560]   that was still pretty strong.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.880]   - What I did notice that the standard of living in Moscow
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:46.400]   was significantly lower than in East Germany.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:52.280]   In the supermarkets, you could expect,
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:55.960]   with reliability, that you can find canned fish
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:00.200]   and mineral water, everything else was whatever.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:04.040]   And if you saw a line at a store, you just line up.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.520]   You don't even ask what they have,
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:08.000]   because if you don't like it, somebody else will.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000]   It was not poverty, but it was close to poverty.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.680]   There were a lot of drunken men in the streets.
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.840]   And-- - This is the '80s?
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.440]   - No, this is the late '70s. - Late '70s.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.760]   - Mid to late '70s.
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:28.760]   And also, they had these high-rise apartment buildings
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:31.160]   that looked pretty good from the front,
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.120]   but you went into the backyard, ouch.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.560]   - Yeah, you're describing my childhood here, okay.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.920]   (both laughing)
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.280]   But it's interesting, even with the professor,
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:46.040]   even with everything else, it's interesting,
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:49.000]   because I think the standard of living was much lower,
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.440]   you're right, even in Moscow.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.080]   - Yeah, absolutely was.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.360]   The one thing that they always had,
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.560]   at least in my days, in those two years,
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.120]   there was always fresh bread in the bullet tinoyas.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.600]   - Yeah. - Always.
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.800]   - Yeah, that's probably one of the memories
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:07.280]   I have of childhood is, well, you're hungry a lot,
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.000]   but when you eat is bread.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.240]   - Yeah, and the bread was good.
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:12.080]   - It was good.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:17.040]   I mean, I actually wonder, I wonder how good it was,
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:19.160]   but I remember it being incredibly good.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:21.160]   - To me, it was really good.
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:24.160]   And you had it from white to very dark
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.040]   and all the varieties.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.720]   The other thing that was good was,
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.000]   if you knew where to get it,
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.520]   stolichnaya was four rubles.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.080]   (Ruby laughing)
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.880]   Not only is it good vodka, but it's cheap vodka.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:40.720]   I like it.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.400]   - Yeah, but you had to know where,
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:45.360]   this would be like holes in the wall someplace.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.520]   - Well, I think a lot of the way they operate,
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:49.040]   I wonder if East Germany is this way,
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:50.800]   but a lot of the ways that Moscow operated,
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.160]   is you kinda, you had to know.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.000]   - Yes.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.920]   - Like there's a very kind of,
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:00.320]   if you make the right friends,
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.760]   if you give money to the right guy,
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:04.640]   the guy, the friend of the friend of the friend
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.560]   is gonna hook you up and there's a culture,
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:11.080]   this is how you work around a very big bureaucracy.
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.160]   - Underground economy.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:14.240]   - Yeah, underground economy, yeah.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:17.920]   You have to, which is, boy,
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:24.560]   such a stark contrast between that and the United States,
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:25.920]   the capitalist system.
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.480]   Yeah, that was a very big culture shock to me,
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:34.240]   to understand the different,
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.760]   fundamentally different way of life,
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:38.960]   but the interesting thing is,
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.760]   human nature pervades both systems.
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:45.240]   There's something about the Russian system
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:48.280]   that reveals human nature more intensely
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:51.000]   because of the underground nature of it,
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.240]   because you get to deal with greed and trust
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.280]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:58.160]   In the United States, there's much more power
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.480]   to the rule of law, so there's rules
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:02.520]   and people follow those rules.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.840]   They get to break the rules nonstop.
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:07.560]   - Well, in East Germany and Russia, I believe,
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:11.240]   theft, if you could get away with it,
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.200]   was part of your economic activity.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.040]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:18.600]   - I have a friend who I went to school with
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:23.040]   up until my fourth year and we reconnected
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.920]   and he told me how he survived.
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:29.480]   He would just steal stuff and then sell it or trade it.
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:32.920]   - Yeah, theft, I mean, it's a relative concept.
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.520]   - You are taking stuff.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.640]   - Bribery, all those kinds of things.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:41.160]   People, you know, corruption, you know,
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.600]   it's a relative term, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.520]   I mean, it is, you have to work around
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:48.640]   the giant bureaucracy about the giant corruption.
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.280]   Corruption builds on top of corruption
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:52.560]   and then it just becomes this giant system
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:55.640]   that's unstable, as you talked about.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:57.000]   - One last word. - Yes.
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:03.560]   - The two years in Moscow taught me how to be alone.
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:07.640]   I had no social interaction.
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:10.760]   - Not with friends, not with women, not--
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:13.920]   - No, the only interaction I had
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:16.440]   was with the folks that trained me.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:20.640]   So I was alone, it was a lonely two years.
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.960]   - For a person who loves love, is that difficult?
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.400]   - Yes, but that prepared me for my first year
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:29.160]   and first and second year in the United States
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:32.200]   because I could not interact socially
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:35.120]   without giving away that something was wrong with me.
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:37.440]   I had to learn how to be an American.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:40.040]   They didn't teach me in Moscow, they couldn't.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:43.400]   - So the first two years in America,
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:45.840]   you had to kind of listen more than talk.
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:48.800]   - Oh, you bet, the very first year, I couldn't even work
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:51.520]   because I had to acquire the documents,
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:55.120]   a social security card and a driver's license
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:58.280]   to get a job and then when I had the job,
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:01.680]   I worked as a bike messenger.
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.760]   That gave me a good opportunity to listen
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:11.360]   because these people, they weren't very curious about me.
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.480]   - What was your name in East Germany?
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:15.000]   What was your name in Moscow?
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.960]   What was your name in America?
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:19.280]   - Okay, so the name I was given at birth
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.560]   is Albrecht Dittrich.
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.200]   Nobody-- - So sexy when you speak
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:24.880]   in German, the German accent.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:28.480]   - I hated that name, Albrecht, I didn't like it.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:30.320]   It was very rarely used.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:34.480]   My mother named me after a famous German painter,
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:35.960]   Albrecht de Dürer.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:39.160]   My cover name in Moscow was known as Dieter
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:44.440]   and in the United States, I became Jack Barsky.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:47.200]   In between, I used a whole bunch of other names
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:50.480]   that were associated with false passports
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.760]   that I used.
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:56.280]   One of the names that I remember is William Dyson
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.480]   because that is the name that was on the Canadian passport
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:02.200]   I used to enter the United States.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:03.960]   - So how did you enter the United States?
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:06.680]   Can we take the journey from Moscow to the United States?
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:08.920]   - Yeah. - What was the assignment?
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.880]   What was that leap?
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:15.000]   What was like-- - Just one thing
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:20.000]   in between, I had a three-month practice trip to Canada.
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.920]   That was a good idea.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:25.560]   And I gotta tell you this one thing that happened there.
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:30.560]   Okay, so because the one thing that I like to tell people
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:34.400]   nowadays is one of the secrets to happiness
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.960]   is the ability to make fun of the worst situations
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.240]   that you're in. - Yes, absolutely.
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:39.560]   - You see the humor. - Yes.
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.320]   - Okay, so here comes something quite humorous,
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:43.520]   in hindsight at least.
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.600]   One of the tasks that I had in Canada
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.560]   was to acquire a birth certificate.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:54.600]   But the name was Henry Van Randel
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.880]   who was born someplace in California
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:00.520]   and I was supposed to write a little letter
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:01.960]   saying I'm Henry Van Randel,
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:04.160]   please send me a copy of my birth certificate.
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:05.280]   The fee is enclosed.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:11.440]   And I lived in a small hotel,
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:14.200]   so the return address, it wasn't visible
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:16.800]   that it was a hotel, that was important.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.800]   So, and it took like three weeks and I get nothing,
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.140]   four weeks I get nothing.
[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:28.140]   Eventually I got annoyed and I mustered the courage
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:33.960]   to call them up for my pay,
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:36.480]   for when I called up the office registrar,
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:40.000]   whatever they were called in this town in California
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.200]   and I yelled at them, I says, you got my money,
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:44.620]   where's my birth certificate?
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:47.080]   Well, a couple of weeks later it came.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.960]   So I see the envelope, it says Henry Van Randel, yes.
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:55.960]   I had prepared the caretakers of the hotel
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:59.480]   that I'm expecting a letter from my friend.
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:02.800]   So I went up to my room, I opened it and I was like,
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.520]   yes, yes, this is a success.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:08.520]   And I opened this thing and it was a copy
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.640]   of a birth certificate but it was stamped
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:13.720]   with big letters across in red, deceased.
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:16.620]   Now think about it, so here's a dead person
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:20.380]   who was asking for his birth certificate.
[01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:26.340]   I had the presence of mind to leave, okay?
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:27.660]   I went to a couple of other cities,
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:30.020]   I should have left the country.
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:34.260]   But I know that the Royal Mounted Police was following me
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:37.580]   and I was given that information by the FBI later on.
[01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:43.500]   - Oh, you were able to at least suspect that at the time?
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:44.780]   - I-- - Through the--
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:48.740]   - I knew that there was trouble.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:54.460]   My counter surveillance route--
[01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:57.320]   - SDR. - Yes, didn't discover anything.
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:02.320]   So I kept on going, I was supposed to visit two more cities
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.660]   and they were always one step behind.
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:10.140]   What is interesting to me is that they didn't catch me
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:11.880]   on the way out.
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:14.660]   You have to show your passport to the airline.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:19.900]   I mean, I was known by name, I would then,
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:22.260]   because I had to give that to the hotel, right?
[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:25.940]   And I escaped with-- - So how would they--
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:28.500]   - By air. - They would have to keep you
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.660]   on a list, right?
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:33.060]   - Yeah. - Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:38.060]   But that requires like a good computerized updated system
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:41.620]   to track all that stuff. - Yeah, this was Swiss Air, so.
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.400]   - Well, you got lucky. - Yeah.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.460]   - Part of life is luck. - You bet.
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:50.460]   So, and other than that, the trip to Canada
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:56.680]   was a big success because it gave me the culture shock
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:04.280]   that I needed to not be blown out of the water
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.460]   when I get to the United States.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:08.720]   - So you hopped a few places in Canada--
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:11.320]   - Yeah. - And then Swiss Air.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:13.520]   I even had a relationship with a young lady.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:18.440]   - Canadian, French-Canadian, regular Canadian?
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:23.440]   - French-Canadian, and she gave me a book,
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:25.960]   Winnie the Pooh, because we went to see the movie,
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:28.120]   and then she wrote a dedication, she says,
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.720]   "To the nicest German I've ever met."
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:32.760]   - Was she lying? - No.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:36.840]   - Or you don't know. (laughing)
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:40.920]   Speaking of "Spycraft," and that led to "Heartbreak," too?
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:45.920]   - No, that was sexual.
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:49.520]   I was not, at that point--
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:50.760]   - Ready for love? - No.
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.640]   - Ready to return to that old--
[01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:56.560]   - Well, and I was already married in Germany.
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:58.480]   Okay, that woman I loved.
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:00.280]   - We should return to this. - Yeah.
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:01.160]   (laughing)
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:06.160]   - So, Swiss Air, where did you land in the United States?
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:09.080]   - Oh, when I came, where did I land?
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:14.440]   An American Airlines flight from Mexico City to Toronto,
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:19.520]   but they made me deplane in Chicago.
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:22.040]   I have no idea, I think that was over-engineering.
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:24.040]   That didn't make any sense to me.
[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:27.120]   You know, why can't a Canadian just take a flight
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:28.160]   from Mexico City?
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:31.720]   With this stopover, that's kind of nonsense.
[01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:34.160]   - Yeah, but okay, but nevertheless, that was it,
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.080]   and then you landed in Chicago.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:37.560]   - Right.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:39.040]   - And tell me the story in America.
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.560]   What was the day-to-day life?
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:43.240]   Now, this is, now you're a spy.
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:46.280]   - No, no, no, I gotta tell you another funny story.
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:48.000]   - Yes. (laughing)
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.800]   - So, it's another, there's two things that happened
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:56.480]   that could've ended my career as a spy right then and there.
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:01.480]   So, I'm arriving in Chicago in the evening.
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:04.640]   It's already dark.
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:09.680]   I had no idea what kind of a hotel to take,
[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:14.680]   and I picked one out of Yellow Pages and got a taxi.
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:17.960]   When I gave him the address,
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:20.440]   he looked at me like a little funny.
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:22.200]   Whatever, what do I know?
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.040]   Just keep on going.
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:27.960]   I need to get sleep because I was extremely tense,
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:32.640]   having gone through customs and border control.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.920]   So, and we are going in the southern direction,
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:38.280]   and I noticed that the neighborhoods
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:41.080]   became less and less inviting.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.960]   Didn't know what that meant either.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:46.080]   And I get, I enter the hotel.
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.960]   It was a five-story brownstone,
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.240]   and something else looked funny.
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:54.520]   So, the reception desk was protected by plexiglass.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.520]   Not having enough background,
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.520]   I didn't know that this was unusual.
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.640]   Because all I knew that there was a lot of crime
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:04.480]   in the United States,
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:07.160]   so I thought maybe every hotel was like that.
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:09.840]   So, I go up into my room and drink a half a bottle
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:12.200]   of Johnny Walker Red because--
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:13.560]   - As one does, yeah.
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:15.360]   (laughing)
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.800]   - Because I was so damn tense, I just wanted to sleep.
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.040]   I wanted to get into a coma, which I did.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.560]   And the next day I woke up with a head
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:26.440]   that was twice as big as, felt twice as big.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:28.040]   But I was prepared.
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:31.160]   I had aspirin with me, so I killed the headache
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:34.240]   and went outside to see if I can get something to eat.
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:37.600]   And so, I was right smack in the middle
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.280]   of the south side of Chicago.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.680]   I didn't know that the south side of Chicago existed.
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:44.440]   I found later, I found out where I was.
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:49.440]   So, it was time to go very quickly.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.720]   Go up there, and at that point I decided
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:56.720]   I would register at the next hotel on the Jack Barsky.
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:03.840]   So, I went to the bathroom and I tried to kill off
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:06.600]   Mr. Dyson by burning his passport.
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:12.400]   Unfortunately, I was not trained in how to train passport,
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:14.280]   how to destroy passports.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:19.440]   So, I tried to burn it, and these things were flame
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:23.720]   retardant, and it created a cloud of smoke.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:26.720]   And I'm looking up there and there's a smoke detector.
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:28.480]   - Yeah, oh no.
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:30.640]   - Okay, so presence of mind, I threw this thing
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:33.920]   in the toilet and then took out a pair of scissors
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:36.760]   and cut it into small pieces and flushed it down.
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:40.760]   If that smoke alarm goes off, I'm busted, right?
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:45.760]   If some criminal steals, I had $6,000 on me in cash,
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:50.340]   steals either my passport or my money or both,
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:52.360]   I don't know what to do.
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:53.640]   - Yeah, you can't go to the authorities,
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:54.480]   you can't do anything.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:57.520]   - There weren't any Russian Soviets in Chicago.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.720]   - Do you have any contacts inside the--
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.720]   - No, there was no plan B for Chicago at all.
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:07.120]   That's an oversight.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:08.960]   I shouldn't have gone to Chicago.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:13.960]   They could have shipped me into San Francisco
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:17.120]   or Washington, D.C. because both of them had Soviets.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:22.120]   My end goal was to go to New York, fine.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:27.120]   I would have been a really, really dangerous agent
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:29.480]   if I had gone back and worked with the KGB
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:32.020]   'cause I could have told 'em all the things,
[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:33.400]   how to do it right, right?
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:36.440]   - So in that sense, there is some,
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:41.040]   given the scale of the KGB, there is some incompetence
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:42.280]   in the system. - Some?
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:44.920]   - A lot of incompetence. - With regard to preparing me
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:48.160]   to be an American, it was almost total incompetence.
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:51.280]   - Do you think that's representative of the way they operate
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:56.280]   is there's an incompetence to the logistics,
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:00.320]   to the strategies involved, all that kind of stuff?
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:04.040]   - Yeah, none of these guys had operated as illegals.
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.880]   They were outsiders to American society.
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.980]   They had interaction with Americans,
[02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:12.160]   but they all lived in New York.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:15.600]   They lived in a compound in northern Manhattan
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:18.040]   where they all lived together with their families.
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:22.520]   And most of the time, they spent interacting with themselves,
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.520]   with their own people at work.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:26.200]   - So they really didn't integrate well.
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:29.200]   - They did not know what it's like to be an American,
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:33.240]   to have a job, to live like an American.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.240]   They didn't know it.
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:37.540]   - It's interesting that KGB didn't put a high value
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:39.000]   to that kind of integration.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.120]   - They didn't know what they didn't know.
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:42.840]   And by the way, this was mutual.
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.000]   Do you think the CIA had good knowledge
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.240]   of the Russian culture?
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.960]   Uh-uh, same thing.
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:52.600]   And so there was a lot of lack of understanding
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:55.840]   because good intelligence could have possibly
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:59.120]   avoided some of the high tension situations
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:02.720]   that we had when in the '80s, we got close to nuclear war.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:06.700]   - So good intelligence would be integrating yourself
[02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:08.200]   in society much, much deeper.
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:10.280]   - Yes, and understanding that Ronald Reagan
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:13.840]   was not a warmonger, but he was talking about the end times
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:16.440]   because he was a Christian.
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:18.640]   - But then that kind of integration can be dangerous
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:21.800]   because you start to question the propaganda,
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:25.000]   the narratives on which the KGB is built,
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.240]   on which the CIA is built.
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:31.000]   - And then they always had the option of ignoring
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.440]   the intelligence that they're getting, right?
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.280]   Yeah.
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:37.000]   - Well, let me ask you this question to jump around.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.880]   There's a lot of conspiracy theories
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:42.840]   in this current climate, I mean, throughout history,
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:44.160]   but now especially.
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:50.080]   And some of the conspiracy theories put a lot of power
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.840]   in the hands of the intelligence agencies like CIA, FSB,
[02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:58.040]   Mossad, MI6.
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:00.760]   They're basically, the conspiracy theories go
[02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:05.760]   that they control the powerful people in this world
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:10.200]   and are able to thereby manipulate those powerful people
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:14.440]   and manipulate the populace in order to deliver
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:16.480]   different kinds of messages and so on.
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:19.920]   Given your experience with this kind of tension
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:22.520]   between competence and malevolence,
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:24.480]   would you say there's some truth
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:26.720]   to those conspiracy theories?
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:28.520]   - Not one way.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.980]   I think there is collusion, there's collaboration,
[02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:35.140]   but I would think that, like for instance,
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:39.680]   some folks in the CIA and the FBI are being used
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:42.480]   by the ones that are really in power.
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:44.320]   Power is money, power is wealth.
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:47.920]   I know power is not--
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:49.640]   - But it can go both directions.
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:53.040]   You can acquire wealth first, which leads you to power,
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:55.000]   or you can acquire power first.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.040]   - Yeah, power is also knowledge, I understand,
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:02.560]   and a position in society in the military
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:05.200]   or in intelligence, but I don't think it's a straight one way
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:07.920]   that all the intelligence agencies control
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.640]   the powerful people in their country.
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:11.140]   You see what's happening in Russia.
[02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:15.560]   I mean, Putin dominates his intelligence agencies, right?
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:21.520]   - Well, so the question is which way the direction goes,
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:25.640]   but you're saying that it's not one way flow of power.
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:30.040]   - I would think so, and I also believe it exists,
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:32.280]   but it's not as prevalent as, you know,
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:35.360]   not every conspiracy theory pans out,
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.080]   and most of them don't.
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:38.240]   They're just damn rumors,
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:39.740]   but that doesn't mean they don't exist.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:41.320]   I guarantee you that they exist.
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.760]   There's collusion, there's people getting together,
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:48.760]   and not necessarily preparing a specific action,
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:52.400]   but more sort of a plan to go forward
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.840]   and maintain the position or even, you know,
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:58.120]   strengthen the position that they already have.
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:02.880]   - So KGB, but we can generalize this, FSB, CIA,
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:05.200]   do you think a KGB agent would kill someone
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:08.360]   against international law if they were ordered to do so?
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.000]   So we talked about-- - They did.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.280]   They did.
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:18.120]   And there's a famous case of one,
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:24.040]   I think it's Vasily Kuklov, who defected.
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:25.760]   He was a killer, he was a trained killer,
[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:30.760]   and he had done assassinations in other countries.
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:34.400]   He was sent to West Germany to kill a defector,
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:37.480]   a KGB defector, and he decided not to do it.
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:39.200]   He talked to the guy, and he said,
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:40.600]   "I'm supposed to kill you, I'm not,"
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:44.280]   and then he eventually wound up in the United States.
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:46.400]   I have a connection to this fellow
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:50.520]   because the KGB once asked me to go to California
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:53.560]   and see if the guy still lives and works there.
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:58.560]   And I found him, and we looked at each other.
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:06.880]   So it was an active KGB agent looking at a man
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:10.200]   that he didn't know was a KGB defector,
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:11.040]   looking at each other.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:13.440]   Neither one knew who the other one was.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:14.520]   I found out later.
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:17.920]   - But he was able to survive.
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:22.920]   - Yes, and there have been assassinations, not a lot.
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:27.800]   And you know that-- - That we know of.
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:28.920]   - A good point.
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:30.280]   - This is very difficult.
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:36.920]   The question is, how many lines are intelligence agencies
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:42.520]   willing to cross to attain, to achieve the goal?
[02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:47.960]   - I think none of these agencies have the ultimate line.
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:52.600]   I think eventually the last line will be crossed
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:56.360]   if they believe it's necessary.
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:58.400]   - Well, I think you can justify a lot of things,
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:00.600]   especially in this modern world with nuclear weapons,
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:03.600]   that you can justify that you're saving the world, actually.
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:06.280]   Let me ask a few difficult questions,
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:08.200]   and we'll jump back to your time in America,
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:13.200]   but Vladimir Putin has been accused
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:16.520]   of ordering the poisoning and assassination
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:20.760]   of several people, including Alexander Litvinenko early on,
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:23.400]   all the way to Alexei Navalny.
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:27.320]   Do you think these accusations are grounded in truth?
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:31.200]   And we will return to a couple more questions,
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:34.960]   maybe, above Vladimir Putin's early days in the KGB,
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:35.880]   which would be interesting.
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:39.800]   - Yeah, there's a phrase that I like to say,
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:43.240]   and in response, it's called plausible deniability.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:46.800]   I don't think Putin gave a direct command to say, do that.
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:48.200]   He would just maybe muse.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:50.960]   It would be nice if something were to happen.
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:53.240]   And then somebody picks it up and does it.
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:57.720]   - Is there, can you still man the case
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:01.640]   that Putin did not have direct or indirect involvement?
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:03.800]   - Who would know?
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:04.640]   Who would know?
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.360]   - Well, the international, the reputation,
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:15.400]   perhaps catalyzed by Putin himself
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.440]   is that he's the kind of person that would directly
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:21.600]   or indirectly make those orders.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:25.720]   Perhaps the case there is he's somebody to be feared,
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:28.680]   and thereby you want that narrative out there.
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:29.880]   - But the act itself,
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:36.000]   the poisoning of Litvinenko,
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.000]   and oh, and then the assassination of the Bulgarian Markov
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.760]   and with the umbrella,
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:46.640]   and they all directly trace back
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:49.680]   to Russian Soviet intelligence.
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:53.400]   And so that's enough to be feared, right?
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:58.640]   My answer that I gave you is an educated guess.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:02.840]   I can't pretend to know this for sure, but--
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.240]   - It's frustrating to me
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:06.120]   because there's a lot of people listening to this
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:10.080]   would say, would even sort of,
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.880]   would chuckle at the naive nature of the question.
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:17.040]   But if you actually keep an open mind,
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:19.120]   you have to understand what is the way
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.760]   that intelligence agencies function?
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:26.720]   Is it possible to the head of an intelligence agency
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:29.560]   not to make direct orders of that kind?
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:30.800]   Where there's a distributed--
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:32.440]   - No, the head of the intelligence agency
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:34.680]   would most likely give the order.
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:36.320]   - Even though it's compartmentalized.
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:39.960]   - Yeah, but not the head of state.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.460]   - Maybe not the head of state.
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:45.720]   Although in the case,
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:47.440]   this is the case in the United States as well,
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:50.040]   but certainly is the case in Russia,
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:51.440]   there are close relationships
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:53.840]   between the head of the FSB and the GRU,
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:56.760]   and personal relationships, not just even--
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:58.800]   - The head of the FSB who is now in jail?
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:01.800]   (Lex laughs)
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:03.720]   - There's interesting details,
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:08.720]   especially coming out recently around the war in Ukraine.
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:13.560]   So let me actually ask about the war in Ukraine.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:19.360]   What is your analysis of the war in Ukraine from 2014
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:22.240]   to the full-on invasion of Ukraine by Russia
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:24.860]   in 2022, in February, 2022?
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:32.200]   What, there's many questions we could ask.
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:37.360]   One is, what are the sins of the governments involved?
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:42.640]   What are the sins of Russia, Ukraine, America, China?
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:48.120]   Are those sins comparable?
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.000]   Who are the good guys and the bad guys?
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.120]   - That was more than one question, though.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:57.120]   Let me just give you the basics about this.
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:01.740]   Savvy observers saw this coming.
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:04.200]   They were a very small minority,
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.480]   because Vladimir Putin was pretty open
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:11.320]   about what he told the world his mission was,
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:14.920]   was the reestablishment of a strong Russia,
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:18.320]   the reestablishment of something like the Russian Empire
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.440]   to unite all the Russian-speaking people
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:27.760]   under one country, and the world ignored him.
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:29.200]   I mean, he was open.
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:32.720]   It was at a conference in France, I believe,
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:35.480]   when he said this out in the open.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.320]   And then what we had in the United States,
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:41.460]   we had wishful thinking.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:45.320]   Obama had this reset with Russia.
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:48.500]   We all get friendly.
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:53.160]   And then when Putin invaded Crimea,
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:54.040]   we did nothing.
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:59.620]   And it just escalated slowly, but surely,
[02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:03.360]   it was pretty clear.
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:06.520]   And they said, it was, I think, two years ago,
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:09.480]   there was an essay published by Putin.
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:11.000]   Whether he wrote it or not doesn't matter,
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.920]   but that was also out in public,
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:15.740]   where he was, again, quite clear what he was gonna do.
[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:16.940]   Now, how do you do this?
[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:19.360]   With force.
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:25.240]   And the sins committed by the American government was,
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:26.080]   we ignored it.
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:28.560]   We weren't engaged in wishful thinking,
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:31.600]   and we didn't stop it with sanctions
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:33.980]   before the shooting started.
[02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:38.700]   - To push back, I don't think you're fully describing,
[02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:39.960]   you are describing the sins
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:42.320]   of the Russian government and Putin.
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:44.040]   I don't think you're fully describing the sins
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:45.800]   of the American government here,
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:47.420]   because not only didn't,
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:51.360]   you're describing the miscalculation.
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:53.680]   So, not only did they not pressure correctly
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:55.200]   with sanctions and so on,
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.280]   and clearly respond to the actual statements
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:02.280]   in the essays and the words spoken.
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.080]   - I know where you're going, but keep on speaking.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:07.780]   - Yes, but they also, at the same time,
[02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:12.420]   pressured Russia, and they also,
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:15.280]   as Putin himself said, sort of, there's a rat,
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:18.380]   and they pushed the rat towards the corner
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:20.360]   by expanding NATO.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:22.200]   And--
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.480]   - And arming Ukraine.
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:28.480]   - And, well, the military industrial complex
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.300]   is a machine that led us,
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:36.240]   and I think a lot of younger people,
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:39.440]   I mean, when I came to this country,
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:41.000]   and this is the country I love,
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.480]   I lived through 9/11.
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:49.960]   I lived through the full rollercoaster of emotion.
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:53.440]   I'm a, at that time, before that,
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:55.880]   and after, was a proud American.
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:58.360]   I went through the whole rollercoaster
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:02.080]   of being sold, I would say, a lie
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:07.080]   about the reason to invade Iraq, and even Afghanistan.
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:11.360]   And I got to live through understanding
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:13.520]   of this military industrial complex
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:17.600]   that leads to the expansion of empires,
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:21.120]   of the delusion that we have in the populace,
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:23.800]   in the government, that convinces us
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:27.680]   that we are the good guys, and somehow,
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:32.680]   with military force, we can instill our values,
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:34.600]   instill happiness, the pursuit of happiness,
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:36.160]   that all men are created equal,
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:39.320]   these ideas into other lands.
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:44.280]   And we can do so with drones, and we can do so with weapons,
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:46.480]   and we can do so without significant cost
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:48.960]   from our own pockets.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:52.400]   And so, this idea, this machine,
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:54.760]   doesn't just apply to Afghanistan and Iraq,
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:57.120]   doesn't just apply to Yemen and Syria,
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:00.160]   it doesn't just apply to China, it also applies to Ukraine.
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.760]   It also applies to Russia.
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:03.540]   - Agreed, two thoughts, if I may.
[02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:08.080]   First of all, one does not hear
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:10.380]   the term military industrial complex
[02:18:10.380 --> 02:18:12.920]   in the public discourse these days.
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:15.360]   Eisenhower warned about it.
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:17.640]   Eisenhower was a capitalist,
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:19.740]   he was the President of the United States.
[02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:24.040]   So, it exists, and it is very powerful.
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:25.520]   The more weapons you can sell,
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:27.880]   the more you have to replace them,
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:30.720]   or send over, you have to replace them, so yes.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.160]   The other thing is, there's also a messianic streak
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:42.160]   that powers American foreign policy.
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:45.520]   We want to make the world just like us.
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:46.740]   Why don't they get it?
[02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:48.240]   Because they don't want to.
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:50.500]   It's almost like, it's not communism,
[02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:53.320]   but it's a very similar romantic idea
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:55.080]   that we can make the world,
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:57.920]   and fashion the world the way we are.
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.160]   And that's the romantic side,
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.760]   and the sort of honest side, but it doesn't work.
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:05.240]   It failed every time, right?
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:08.320]   You know, Afghanistan is a royal mess,
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:11.860]   and would never become a functioning democracy.
[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:15.800]   I don't know if Ukraine can become a functioning democracy.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.660]   - Well, I don't know if American weapons
[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:22.860]   can help Ukraine become a functional democracy.
[02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:25.960]   - Yeah, absolutely right.
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:28.080]   - But there's a huge amount of interest
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:31.560]   in seeing the world in black and white,
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:34.280]   and selling the story of the world as black and white,
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:38.360]   that Ukraine is the symbol of democracy
[02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:42.800]   in this Eastern European world,
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:47.120]   and Russia is the symbol of authoritarian dictatorship.
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:49.240]   And the story is not so simple,
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:51.960]   as many indices show,
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:54.760]   Ukraine and Russia are the number one,
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:57.480]   and the number two most corrupt countries in Europe.
[02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:59.240]   - They're two peas in a pod.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:03.360]   One is bigger, and one is, in this case, the aggressor.
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:05.640]   Now, you know, two peas,
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:10.180]   the aggressor is still ultimately responsible.
[02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:13.380]   - The person that throws the first punch,
[02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:15.500]   now there's a lot of people going to disagree
[02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:17.460]   where the first punch came from.
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:20.300]   But there is magnitude.
[02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:21.140]   - Yes.
[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:26.140]   - And the struggle by Ukraine for its sovereignty
[02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:29.220]   stretches back to the beginning of the 20th century.
[02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:31.580]   It stretches back even further than that.
[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:35.500]   But there's been the Ukrainian people are proud people,
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:39.320]   and they've been, in many cases, tortured
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:41.720]   by those that sit in the Kremlin
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:43.420]   throughout the 20th century.
[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:46.780]   - The famine in the early '30s.
[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:49.460]   - And it's always, it's never the middle class
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:51.060]   and the upper class that suffer.
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:56.060]   It's always the lower classes, the peasants in that time.
[02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:59.100]   This history stretches back far,
[02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.940]   and this is yet another manifestation of that.
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:05.540]   And there's a lot of interest at play.
[02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:10.540]   China watches closely, Russia, America watches closely,
[02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:13.980]   and there's an extra caveat here
[02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:15.860]   that there's nuclear weapons at play as well.
[02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:16.680]   - Exactly.
[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:23.060]   And it's, this is, the situation is as dangerous
[02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:27.900]   as I have lived through in my entire life, I believe.
[02:21:27.900 --> 02:21:31.440]   And because it's not necessarily at the highest point
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:34.260]   of escalation, but it will be, in my view,
[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:38.420]   a protracted crisis, and the longer that crisis lasts,
[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:42.480]   the more of a chance there is of an accident.
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:43.500]   - Yeah.
[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:45.380]   One rocket. - Yeah.
[02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:48.540]   - There seems to be a strong incentive to prolong,
[02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:51.660]   to do siege tactics to prolong this conflict
[02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:56.660]   over perhaps many years, which is terrifying to think about.
[02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:01.220]   And over that, one single rocket can lead
[02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:05.280]   to, given that there's leaders that might not,
[02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:06.680]   that might be losing their mind.
[02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:07.520]   - Yeah.
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:10.980]   - And Ukraine is not part of NATO,
[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:15.740]   the thing I'm really afraid of is that somebody might think
[02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:19.320]   it's a good idea, but for Russia,
[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:21.580]   so Putin might think it's a good idea for Russia
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:26.580]   to send a message by launching a nuke against Ukraine,
[02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.840]   because they're not part of NATO.
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:31.400]   So surely the West is not going to respond.
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:33.360]   What is the West going to do?
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:34.200]   - Yeah.
[02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:38.140]   - If Russia nukes Ukraine to send a message?
[02:22:38.140 --> 02:22:41.920]   I don't know if anyone knows the answer to that question,
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.220]   but it's a terrifying question.
[02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:47.560]   - And I don't know the exact protocol
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:52.560]   that needs to be followed to launch a nuclear strike
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:56.740]   from NATO's end, because we have several countries
[02:22:56.740 --> 02:22:58.940]   in NATO that have nuclear weapons.
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:02.520]   So let's say for France to fire a nuke,
[02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:04.760]   does the United States have to agree?
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:05.880]   I don't know how that works.
[02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:09.640]   - I don't know if anyone knows how that works.
[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:10.640]   - Okay, yeah.
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:13.660]   - I worry, now we have different,
[02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:17.580]   very kind of anecdotal perspectives on these things,
[02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:19.160]   but the people I've interacted with
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:23.120]   in the DOD, Department of Defense, in the military,
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:25.400]   there is a compartmentalization.
[02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:28.800]   There is a bureaucracy, and within that giant bureaucracy,
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:29.760]   there's incompetence.
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:34.760]   We'd like to think that there is like really well organized
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:37.700]   for really important things.
[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:40.600]   There's going to be the best of the best in the world
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:43.660]   that's going to execute on the correct decisions,
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:46.700]   both geopolitically, militarily, all that kind of stuff.
[02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:50.900]   And I've seen enough to know that competence
[02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:53.700]   at any level of government, at any level of the military
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:54.560]   is not guaranteed.
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:57.340]   Let's go back to the law of hierarchy.
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:24:01.400]   The government is the biggest hierarchy there is.
[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:06.160]   And so, invariably, politicians find their way to the top.
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:07.480]   And once you have politics
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:12.480]   and dictating substantive decisions,
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:16.320]   they're going to be weak or wrong.
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:20.680]   I don't know how this could work any other way.
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:24.000]   Right now, we have some functional idiots
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.440]   in the central United States government.
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:30.760]   - Well, let me, 'cause you said that,
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:33.080]   I think elsewhere you said that Putin
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:35.160]   was not a good KGB agent.
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:36.520]   - That's right. - A mediocre one,
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:38.920]   but is an excellent politician.
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:41.220]   - Yeah, and a good organizer.
[02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:43.120]   He was known as a really, really good organizer.
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:48.120]   When Yeltsin hired him as prime minister,
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:52.280]   he cleaned up the mess,
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:56.640]   because under Yeltsin,
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:24:58.960]   Russia deteriorated tremendously,
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:02.960]   and it became sort of a mix of oligarchy
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:06.640]   and a criminal enterprise and chaotic.
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:08.960]   - So he had skills that made him a good executive.
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:09.800]   - Absolutely.
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:12.480]   - Now, let's go back to him as a KGB agent.
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:14.760]   He was a KGB agent.
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:18.840]   I mean, according to him, once a KGB agent,
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:20.080]   always a KGB agent.
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:23.420]   But 16 years, let's say, something like this.
[02:25:23.420 --> 02:25:28.940]   What do you think about, from your experience,
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:33.280]   now you're maybe the same age as him,
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:34.720]   approximately the same age as him.
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:35.680]   - He's a little younger.
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:37.120]   - A little younger. - Yeah.
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:41.360]   - What do you think about the KGB experience
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:44.320]   he had made him the man he is?
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:48.560]   What aspect of that, from your own experience,
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:51.600]   how much does that define you, who you are,
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:53.040]   how you think about the world,
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:56.160]   how you analyze the geopolitics of the world,
[02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:57.960]   how you analyze human nature?
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:25:59.680]   - Now, I gotta tell you one thing.
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:01.860]   He had a different type of training than I did.
[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:06.860]   Mine was one-on-one, and he went to school, so to speak.
[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:08.680]   - Classroom training.
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:09.520]   - Right.
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:16.840]   But fundamentally, he was not a top agent,
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:19.480]   and this is very simple.
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:21.840]   There's only one thing you need to know.
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:24.600]   He knows German pretty well.
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:27.120]   So where was he deployed?
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:28.720]   In East Germany.
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:31.040]   Not in West Germany, not in Switzerland, not in Austria.
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:32.800]   That's where they sent the best, right?
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:35.600]   One would think, generally.
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:37.200]   - We're learning here. - Right.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:39.320]   - So this is your classification
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:41.120]   of where they sent the best.
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:42.860]   People classify all kinds of stuff,
[02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:45.280]   like what is the best university in the world,
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:47.320]   what is the best football team in the world.
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:50.600]   And you start to get a sense, the good guys get sent,
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:53.240]   the best athletes get sent to,
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.560]   well, we can disagree on this,
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:56.800]   but what the football team is.
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:58.280]   But you have a sense, and you're saying
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:00.120]   that the best agents would have been sent to West Germany.
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:00.960]   - One would think so.
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:02.800]   Now, this is not a forcing argument,
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:07.800]   but I also have it from a word from the horse's mouth.
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:10.480]   - Which horse?
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:13.080]   I mean, what kind of horse?
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:13.920]   What's the breed of the horse?
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:15.400]   - Oleg Kalugin.
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:18.800]   You know who Oleg Kalugin is, and he's still alive.
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:22.440]   He was, at one point, the head of counterintelligence
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:25.800]   for the first directorate espionage, right?
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:27.760]   And Putin was in the first directorate
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:30.720]   and reported to Kalugin for a while.
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:33.760]   And Oleg told me to my face
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:38.760]   that Oleg was not an impressive agent trainee, or agent.
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.040]   - That Vladimir Putin was not impressive.
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:42.420]   - Not impressive at all.
[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:46.320]   Now, he's biased, given his current situation.
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:50.160]   - Well, yeah, he could still make it up
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:53.300]   because he had this big ruckus when he was in Parliament
[02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:58.200]   and called Putin a war criminal about the war in Serbia.
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:27:59.680]   - Not only could he make it up,
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:01.780]   I wouldn't trust his analysis.
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:02.980]   (Roger laughs)
[02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:05.780]   I mean, I have to, when people,
[02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:08.720]   I've been working very hard, even before this war,
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:10.520]   to try to understand objective analysis
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:12.640]   of all the parties involved.
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:14.660]   You have to really keep an open mind here
[02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:16.880]   to see clearly, to understand.
[02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:20.900]   If you are to try to help in some way
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:27.040]   make a better world, in this case, stop this war,
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:31.660]   or have all the countries involved flourish,
[02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:33.320]   bring out the best of the people,
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:35.540]   remove the corruption and the greed
[02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:37.780]   and the destructive aspects of the governments,
[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:39.180]   and let the people flourish.
[02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:43.480]   For all of that, you have to put all the biases aside,
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:46.380]   all the political bickering, all the,
[02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:53.440]   I don't know, all the biased analysis.
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:57.320]   And there's a lot of propaganda
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:02.320]   that says that, in fact, Putin was a good agent.
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:05.160]   How else would he rise to the ranks, right?
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:08.400]   - Because he was a good politician
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:13.400]   and he made a lot of good connections within the KGB.
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:15.400]   Allow me to say something.
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:18.560]   You just taught me a lesson.
[02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:23.000]   And the lesson I should have figured out myself
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.580]   because I keep on telling people that,
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:30.320]   in the intelligence world, you never know the truth 100%.
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:31.920]   So when you said, "Oh, I could make that up,"
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:34.000]   of course you could have.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.120]   But you get to a point where you're forced
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:39.600]   to make a decision or have an opinion
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:43.360]   and then you use your best educated guess.
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:44.200]   - Yes.
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:46.480]   - So I'm gonna take the certainty
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:48.400]   of the statement that I made back
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:50.760]   because it's quite possible that you're right.
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:53.160]   - Well, what I've noticed about Vladimir Putin,
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:55.560]   and this is true about, for example, Donald Trump
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:59.700]   and all those kinds of divisive figures,
[02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:02.400]   that for some reason, people's opinion
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:05.720]   on the details of those people are very sticky.
[02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:08.120]   Once you decide this is a bad guy,
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:11.200]   there's like a black hole
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:15.520]   and people are not able to think one act at a time.
[02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:19.560]   You don't have to, that doesn't somehow justify this,
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:24.320]   that somehow doesn't remove all the evil things
[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:25.920]   that are done, but you can analyze clearly
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:27.080]   each of the actions.
[02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:29.440]   And to me, it is interesting to see
[02:30:29.440 --> 02:30:32.900]   how did this man rise through the ranks?
[02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:37.060]   Now, you're saying that to be a KGB agent,
[02:30:37.060 --> 02:30:38.760]   there's a lot of skills involved.
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:44.980]   And perhaps raw technical skill of spycraft
[02:30:44.980 --> 02:30:50.420]   is perhaps not related to the skill
[02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:52.380]   of rising through the ranks.
[02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:53.560]   - Right.
[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:55.380]   - And you're saying as a politician,
[02:30:55.380 --> 02:30:56.220]   he was good at rising through the ranks.
[02:30:56.220 --> 02:30:58.720]   - But lying and influencing,
[02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:02.140]   that is something that is significant,
[02:31:02.140 --> 02:31:05.780]   has a significant talent and ability
[02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:07.380]   that an agent must have,
[02:31:07.380 --> 02:31:10.940]   that helps you as a politician.
[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:15.620]   - Continuing the kind of thread of the role of KGB
[02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:20.620]   in defining the heart, soul, and mind of Vladimir Putin.
[02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:24.940]   Let me return to Yuri Bezmenov,
[02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:26.540]   who was a Soviet KGB agent
[02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:30.340]   that wrote a four-step framework for ideological subversion
[02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:33.740]   on a national scale, as practiced by the Soviet Union.
[02:31:33.740 --> 02:31:38.740]   So the four steps are demoralization, destabilization,
[02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:41.820]   crisis, and normalization.
[02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:44.460]   He had a lot of other kind of systematic ways
[02:31:44.460 --> 02:31:46.220]   of describing this kind of stuff.
[02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:49.880]   So can you speak to some of these ideas
[02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:52.640]   about the systematic, large-scale,
[02:31:53.820 --> 02:31:56.580]   ideological subversion goals of the KGB?
[02:31:56.580 --> 02:31:59.780]   Is there truth to that kind of, those ideas?
[02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:04.780]   - Yes, but I think I already sort of mentioned
[02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:08.180]   that I think Bezmenov was a fraud.
[02:32:08.180 --> 02:32:10.220]   And I have, again--
[02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:11.780]   - Can you elaborate?
[02:32:11.780 --> 02:32:14.960]   - Good arguments, let's put it this way.
[02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:18.780]   First of all, we know that the KGB
[02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:21.140]   was involved in active measures,
[02:32:21.140 --> 02:32:26.140]   which is, you can call it fake news.
[02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:33.220]   Seeding fake news into the countries
[02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:35.420]   that are your adversaries.
[02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:38.580]   And the Russians have been doing this lately
[02:32:38.580 --> 02:32:40.580]   by meddling in our election,
[02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:43.740]   and focusing on the left and the right fringe,
[02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:47.140]   and influencing them to become more left and more right.
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:52.980]   And Vasily Mitrokhin has, in one of his books,
[02:32:52.980 --> 02:32:57.060]   he has a whole chapter about active measures.
[02:32:57.060 --> 02:33:00.540]   Okay, so what he has to say about the department,
[02:33:00.540 --> 02:33:02.700]   and I forgot what department it was,
[02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:05.860]   was the one department that was the least desirable
[02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:09.500]   for KGB agents, because these were desk jobs
[02:33:09.500 --> 02:33:13.620]   for people who had to come up with fake stories
[02:33:14.820 --> 02:33:18.140]   in countries where they didn't quite know
[02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:20.260]   too much about the country.
[02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:22.540]   Now, there were some successes,
[02:33:22.540 --> 02:33:26.880]   like one of the two most famous successes
[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:30.340]   that I'm aware of is that the canard,
[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:34.840]   that the AIDS virus was concocted in a CIA lab.
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:38.860]   A lot of people around the world believe that.
[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:42.740]   And the other one was that J. Edgar Hoover
[02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:44.740]   was a secret cross-dressers.
[02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:46.580]   (laughing)
[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:49.900]   That is still known by a lot of Americans
[02:33:49.900 --> 02:33:52.700]   who are of a certain age that this was the truth.
[02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:55.540]   But Mitrokhin actually traces it back
[02:33:55.540 --> 02:33:59.580]   to a story that was placed in a sort of left wing,
[02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:03.400]   but close to mainstream French magazine,
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:06.900]   and it was then taken up by more,
[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:13.420]   larger newspapers and well-established papers.
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:17.100]   So they had some successes, but this kind of a
[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:23.620]   massive, well-thought-out campaign
[02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:26.260]   to destabilize the United States,
[02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:30.660]   I don't believe the KGB was capable of doing that.
[02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:33.540]   Mitrokhin seems to agree with me.
[02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:36.980]   I was trained, I would think,
[02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:39.940]   you know, I was one of the crown jewels of the agents.
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:42.080]   One would think that they used the best
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:47.080]   that they had to help me how to become an American,
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:48.900]   and they didn't have a clue.
[02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:52.000]   So how did they, if you don't know how a country operates,
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:57.000]   how do you come up with this kind of a very detailed,
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.560]   long-term plan that's also timed,
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:03.180]   you know, two years this and one year that and all that?
[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:05.880]   - Yeah, so we should actually just clarify.
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:10.880]   So he has this whole idea that there's 15 to 20 years
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:13.120]   that are needed for demoralization,
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:19.320]   where you're basically infiltrating a country
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:22.400]   from a young, or people from a young age,
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:24.960]   manipulating their mind, you're destabilizing them,
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:27.740]   that's the second step, that takes two to five years.
[02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:30.080]   You target the country's foreign relations,
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:33.580]   defense and economy, you create a crisis artificially,
[02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:37.420]   and then you normalize it as if it always was this way.
[02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:41.980]   So it's basically saying that the KGB is capable of,
[02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:45.860]   at scale, over many years,
[02:35:45.860 --> 02:35:51.940]   manipulate an entire population of people.
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:53.100]   And this is kind of,
[02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:58.420]   there's a lot of people that believe in conspiracy theories
[02:35:58.420 --> 02:36:02.020]   that are amenable to this kind of idea.
[02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:06.060]   Now, my own experience is that there is, in fact,
[02:36:06.060 --> 02:36:08.700]   just a giant amount of incompetence,
[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:10.260]   and that this is something that's actually
[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:11.700]   very difficult to pull off.
[02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:14.620]   'Cause it's incredibly,
[02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:21.260]   incredibly difficult to achieve this kind of manipulation.
[02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:23.760]   I think it would require,
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:29.220]   first of all, not much bureaucracy, not much slowing down.
[02:36:29.220 --> 02:36:32.140]   You have to have incredible, in the modern world,
[02:36:32.140 --> 02:36:34.780]   digital systems that are able to do surveillance,
[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:38.140]   manipulation, there has to be a strategy
[02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:40.300]   that is carried out in secrecy
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:43.620]   across a huge number of people, effectively,
[02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:46.960]   that also requires you hire the best people in the world.
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.700]   And I think it's difficult to execute on this kind of thing
[02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:56.480]   if you compartmentalize,
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:59.220]   because there has to be great collaboration.
[02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:02.940]   There has to be a great, where there's a unified vision.
[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:04.220]   - Coordination.
[02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:07.420]   - And coordination across multiple groups.
[02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:10.940]   There has to be, I mean, it's very difficult to do.
[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:14.340]   Now, nevertheless, especially with technology,
[02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:15.780]   this becomes easier and easier.
[02:37:15.780 --> 02:37:17.880]   So the bar becomes lower and lower.
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:20.340]   To achieve mass surveillance
[02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:22.660]   becomes easier and easier and easier.
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:25.340]   Mass manipulation through platforms,
[02:37:25.340 --> 02:37:27.000]   because we're now digitally connected,
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.180]   you can now do that kind of manipulation.
[02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:30.760]   So it becomes more and more realistic
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:31.900]   that you could do this kind of thing.
[02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:36.140]   But you're saying that, no, intelligence,
[02:37:36.140 --> 02:37:38.340]   first of all, intelligence is hard.
[02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:42.740]   And to do it at scale and to do it well
[02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:46.820]   and to do it in a way that it's also
[02:37:46.820 --> 02:37:49.380]   not just collecting information about the populace,
[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:52.420]   but manipulating the populace is very, very difficult.
[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:55.140]   - Right, now let me give you another argument
[02:37:55.140 --> 02:37:57.180]   why I think that Besminov was a fraud.
[02:37:58.300 --> 02:38:03.100]   I mean, I already have Mitrokhin on my side
[02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:07.060]   and my personal observation of the incompetence
[02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:08.640]   that I witnessed.
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:11.060]   I mean, they really, really didn't know
[02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:12.540]   what they didn't know.
[02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:17.140]   So now Besminov was KGB, where was he stationed?
[02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:17.980]   In India.
[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:23.440]   He was a low-level agent in India.
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:27.820]   And I told you, the one thing that KGB was really good
[02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:30.700]   at was compartmentalization.
[02:38:30.700 --> 02:38:35.260]   How does Besminov in India find out about this massive plan
[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:37.940]   that should have been super secret, right?
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:39.620]   He made it up, sorry.
[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:42.300]   And you know why he got away with it?
[02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:45.260]   Because Americans eat that up, because it's not our fault.
[02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:49.100]   It's like the damn Russians that doing all that bad stuff.
[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:52.380]   Speaking of the damn Russians doing all that bad stuff,
[02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:55.620]   you know about the Internet Research Agency.
[02:38:55.620 --> 02:38:58.260]   They have been doing quite a bit of damage.
[02:38:58.260 --> 02:39:02.860]   And I'm now familiar with a world
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:06.660]   of enhanced artificial persons.
[02:39:06.660 --> 02:39:10.020]   These are the avatars on Facebook and Twitter
[02:39:10.020 --> 02:39:13.840]   and so forth that look like real people.
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:18.300]   And there are quite a few of them.
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:22.460]   And I have a good friend who operates in that realm.
[02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:26.420]   And he uses, for instance, facial recognition
[02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:31.420]   when he thinks that there's a suspicious character,
[02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:35.560]   say, on LinkedIn or on Facebook.
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:39.420]   And very often he finds out, yeah, that that person exists,
[02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:43.980]   but it's not the person who it pretends to be.
[02:39:43.980 --> 02:39:46.640]   - So basically detecting the artificial,
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:47.740]   the enhanced artificial people.
[02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:50.220]   - Yes, but he can also make them.
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:51.060]   You think the United States--
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:52.260]   - Right, it goes hand in hand, yeah.
[02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:55.140]   United States doesn't do it, we do it too, but--
[02:39:55.140 --> 02:39:57.900]   - Well, this is to push back against your pushback, right?
[02:39:57.900 --> 02:39:59.820]   Yeah, Beslanov might be a fraud,
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:04.060]   but is it possible, especially in the modern age,
[02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:07.740]   that there is these kind of large-scale systematic,
[02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:12.140]   wouldn't you, as a government--
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:12.980]   - More so.
[02:40:12.980 --> 02:40:17.860]   - That's investing billions of dollars
[02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:20.560]   into military equipment,
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:24.900]   in a world that's more and more clearly
[02:40:24.900 --> 02:40:29.900]   going to be defined by cyber war versus hot war,
[02:40:29.900 --> 02:40:34.740]   wouldn't you start to have serious meetings,
[02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:37.900]   large amounts of hires that are working at
[02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:41.140]   how do we manipulate the information flow,
[02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:43.980]   how do we manipulate the minds of the populace,
[02:40:43.980 --> 02:40:45.580]   how do we sell them a narrative?
[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:49.620]   So even though he might've been making up a story
[02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:51.980]   because people eat it up,
[02:40:51.980 --> 02:40:53.620]   could it speak to some deep truth
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:56.700]   that's actually different than the truth
[02:40:56.700 --> 02:40:59.140]   you came up in as a KGB agent?
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:01.520]   - I agree with you 100%, it's much easier.
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:07.060]   All you need is an army of nerds who also know--
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:08.580]   - No offense.
[02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:09.700]   No offense to the nerds.
[02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:11.660]   - That's a term of endearment, I guess.
[02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:13.260]   - Yes, of love. - I love nerds.
[02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:16.780]   I used to be one myself, so.
[02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:17.620]   But anyway--
[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:18.860]   - Once a nerd, always a nerd, so.
[02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:20.940]   (both laughing)
[02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:22.940]   - So what I was gonna say here is--
[02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:24.780]   - All you need is an army of nerds.
[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:29.780]   - And what also experts in the culture
[02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:32.020]   of the target country, okay?
[02:41:32.020 --> 02:41:35.300]   And nowadays the world is different.
[02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:36.900]   There's a whole lot more fluidity,
[02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:39.380]   there's a whole lot of more people that like say Russians,
[02:41:39.380 --> 02:41:41.820]   for instance, study in the United States, Chinese,
[02:41:41.820 --> 02:41:44.500]   an army of Chinese studying in the United States,
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:48.620]   they have a lot more knowledge of how we function
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:52.300]   than the KGB did, and it's vice versa.
[02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:56.240]   Not as many Americans in Russia, but we have some,
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:59.300]   but the Chinese and the Russians have an advantage here.
[02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:02.620]   - Can I ask you a question based on your experience?
[02:42:02.620 --> 02:42:07.620]   So I have been talking to a lot of powerful people,
[02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:13.540]   and some of which have very close connections
[02:42:13.540 --> 02:42:17.320]   to in this particular conflict, Ukraine and Russia,
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:19.500]   but in other places as well.
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.100]   I don't believe I've ever been contacted by
[02:42:22.100 --> 02:42:24.780]   or interacted with an intelligence agency.
[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:29.780]   CIA, FSB, MI6, Assad, I don't think I have,
[02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:33.740]   well, let me say explicitly,
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:35.580]   I haven't had an official conversation,
[02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:37.960]   which is what I assume I would have,
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:40.260]   because I have nothing to hide, right?
[02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:43.520]   So I think there's no reason for people to be secretive.
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:47.500]   But why is that?
[02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:48.820]   Would I know?
[02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:50.420]   Am I interesting at all?
[02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:52.460]   How are people determined if they're
[02:42:52.460 --> 02:42:54.300]   in person of interest or not?
[02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:57.700]   And I guess the question, I mean, some of it I ask
[02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:00.700]   in a bit of a humorous way, but also perhaps
[02:43:00.700 --> 02:43:02.660]   there's truth in some of the humor is,
[02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:05.760]   would I know if I have ever interacted
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:10.200]   with an intelligence agency spy?
[02:43:11.060 --> 02:43:14.240]   - Well, you don't know that you haven't been contacted,
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:19.240]   but certainly not, I think you never had a conversation
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:24.480]   that related to intelligence in any way, shape, or form.
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:27.240]   - Right, like where a person, another person introduced--
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:31.840]   - Yeah, introduced themselves or becomes,
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:34.440]   sort of wants to be your friend and then talks
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:36.600]   about these types of topics, right?
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:39.480]   - Yeah, but I (laughs)
[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:45.460]   there's people, because of who I'm interacting with,
[02:43:45.460 --> 02:43:50.340]   they're, I mean, even with Elon Musk,
[02:43:50.340 --> 02:43:51.820]   like if you think about Elon Musk,
[02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:54.820]   there's a lot of people that are part
[02:43:54.820 --> 02:43:59.660]   of the conversations that happen.
[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:01.540]   How do I know they're all trustworthy?
[02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:03.780]   They all present themselves as trustworthy.
[02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:06.420]   Now, again, I have nothing, so this is
[02:44:06.420 --> 02:44:08.820]   for the intelligence agencies, I have nothing to hide.
[02:44:08.820 --> 02:44:11.560]   I am the same person privately as publicly,
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:16.440]   well-intentioned, real, no controlled,
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:18.940]   no weird sexual stuff where you can manipulate me.
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:20.280]   (Lex laughs)
[02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:21.480]   What else? - No drug use?
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:25.460]   - No drug use, no skeletons in the closet,
[02:44:25.460 --> 02:44:30.920]   none of that kind of stuff, but I don't know,
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:33.820]   I mean, just even having these conversations,
[02:44:33.820 --> 02:44:36.040]   I tend to trust people as a default.
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:37.800]   - Yeah, me too.
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:42.540]   - And you start, when you think, well,
[02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:45.640]   especially with some of the people I've been talking with
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:48.140]   and some of the traveling I'm doing,
[02:44:48.140 --> 02:44:53.140]   I'm realizing there's hard men in this world,
[02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:58.800]   there's military, there's serious suffering,
[02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:02.340]   and there's war, and there's serious people
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:06.800]   that are doing serious harm, and so you have to be careful
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:08.560]   of thinking who to trust.
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:11.880]   The person approaches you with a smile
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:15.720]   and asks you a question, my natural inclination
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:19.400]   is that person is a cool person, I'll answer the question,
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:22.560]   I'll become a friend, but it becomes difficult
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:24.840]   when you realize that there's things
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:28.720]   like intelligence agencies with thousands of employees,
[02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:31.120]   there's people that are doing major military actions
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:33.160]   that involve tens of thousands,
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:35.360]   hundreds of thousands of soldiers.
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:38.680]   This is serious stuff, and so how do you know
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:39.840]   how to operate in this world?
[02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:41.800]   - The folks that you're interacting with
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:45.880]   have a responsibility not to tell you
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:48.480]   what they shouldn't tell you, right?
[02:45:48.480 --> 02:45:49.320]   - Right.
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:51.240]   - So, and most of them probably won't,
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:53.940]   and I'm guessing occasionally they will say,
[02:45:53.940 --> 02:45:56.640]   well, I can't go there, right?
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:57.480]   - Yeah.
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:02.480]   - So what you are aware of is sort of public,
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:08.920]   and what you're doing is you're collecting it
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:13.920]   and you're editing it to some extent,
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:18.320]   you're not changing the verbiage,
[02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:22.200]   you just repeat what they say,
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:27.200]   so from that angle you're not privy to any real secrets.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.880]   What you have possibly that could be of use
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:35.160]   is you learn to get to know the person.
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:39.280]   So I'm thinking there's a good possibility
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:43.520]   if you get the interviews in the East
[02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:45.360]   that somebody may actually approach you
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:47.520]   and ask you what's your opinion.
[02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:49.120]   - I just hope they approach me
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:51.120]   and introduce themselves properly.
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:56.120]   I just, there's a kind of, I mean, would you know,
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:59.980]   like how many Russian spies are there in the United States,
[02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:02.380]   how many American spies are there in Russia?
[02:47:02.380 --> 02:47:03.580]   Do you have a sense?
[02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:04.420]   Is it-- - No idea.
[02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:06.160]   - I mean, just like with the GRU.
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:07.000]   - No idea.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:10.560]   - Is it possible there's like tens of thousands,
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:12.780]   and we're not, or like thousands?
[02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:15.780]   - Not thousands like I used to operate.
[02:47:15.780 --> 02:47:17.220]   We are too hard to train
[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:19.780]   and we weren't that successful to begin with,
[02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:23.980]   but particularly Russians and Chinese,
[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:30.420]   both governments know who is going abroad.
[02:47:30.420 --> 02:47:35.520]   And I guarantee you there's a lot of amateur spies.
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:38.020]   They're being asked, you know, help us out,
[02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:40.460]   you know, do something for the motherland.
[02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:42.100]   - And crowdsource spying.
[02:47:42.100 --> 02:47:43.540]   - Yeah, sort of.
[02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:44.940]   - Not serious training, but yeah.
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:48.340]   - And yeah, for instance, this lady,
[02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:52.740]   I forgot her first name, Butina, she was a rank amateur.
[02:47:52.740 --> 02:47:56.420]   She used social media to communicate with Moscow.
[02:47:56.420 --> 02:48:01.380]   She had no training, but she was reasonably successful.
[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:06.380]   I mean, she got, and the difference between,
[02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:13.280]   let's say the current Russian intelligence and the KGB,
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:16.100]   Vladimir Putin and his henchmen
[02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:21.780]   are okay with people being caught because,
[02:48:21.780 --> 02:48:25.140]   and every time I go and talk and give a talk someplace,
[02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:26.660]   I'm always asked this question,
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:30.980]   "How many Russian spies do you think we have here?"
[02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:33.380]   Because it scares the people, right?
[02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:35.460]   And Putin likes to scare people.
[02:48:35.460 --> 02:48:38.860]   The KGB was very solicitous of the agents.
[02:48:38.860 --> 02:48:43.500]   They didn't want anyone of them caught, right?
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:46.060]   So that's a big difference.
[02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:49.020]   - So getting caught, so for the FSB,
[02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:51.420]   getting caught sends a strong signal to the world
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:52.260]   that there's agents everywhere.
[02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:55.020]   - Yeah, there could be many more, and there probably are.
[02:48:55.020 --> 02:49:02.140]   Because the world, again,
[02:49:02.140 --> 02:49:04.140]   there's a whole lot more travel going on,
[02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:05.860]   a whole lot more interaction,
[02:49:05.860 --> 02:49:08.700]   studying abroad, doing business.
[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:12.820]   And there will be attempts at espionage
[02:49:12.820 --> 02:49:16.060]   probably every minute in this country.
[02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:18.720]   That doesn't mean they will be successful, no.
[02:49:20.380 --> 02:49:23.420]   But there is a cottage industry now
[02:49:23.420 --> 02:49:27.060]   that is doing quite well that teaches companies
[02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:32.060]   how to fortify themselves against industrial espionage
[02:49:32.060 --> 02:49:37.540]   or also foreign actors spying.
[02:49:37.540 --> 02:49:38.660]   It's all over the place.
[02:49:38.660 --> 02:49:40.220]   - Yeah, as it becomes easier and easier
[02:49:40.220 --> 02:49:43.940]   with digital, with cyber, that becomes a serious,
[02:49:43.940 --> 02:49:44.900]   very serious threat.
[02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:48.060]   - We might wind up in a world where nobody knows anymore
[02:49:48.060 --> 02:49:49.380]   what's up and what's down.
[02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:50.980]   (Lex laughs)
[02:49:50.980 --> 02:49:53.860]   - If I was to have a conversation with Vladimir Putin
[02:49:53.860 --> 02:49:57.620]   and/or Volodymyr Zelensky,
[02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:00.300]   is there something you would ask
[02:50:00.300 --> 02:50:05.840]   about the time in the KGB,
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:08.460]   the time in its past?
[02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:14.300]   All of us, men and women, are creations
[02:50:14.300 --> 02:50:16.500]   of the experiences we have through our life,
[02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:20.180]   early on in life and through the formative experiences,
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:21.820]   successes and failures.
[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:24.980]   - Yeah, you just said the key words.
[02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:28.720]   I would ask, without giving away anything,
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:31.380]   just being high level, your biggest success
[02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:33.380]   and your biggest failure.
[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:35.620]   - As a politician or as a KGB agent?
[02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:40.100]   - We're talking in the realm of KGB.
[02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:45.100]   When the wall came down and he was in an office,
[02:50:45.420 --> 02:50:48.260]   a KGB office in the city of Dresden,
[02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:53.260]   and these Germans were besieging Stasi offices,
[02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:59.140]   and they also dropped by the KGB office,
[02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:03.520]   and it was pretty threatening.
[02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:06.860]   It looked like they were actually storm the office
[02:51:06.860 --> 02:51:10.500]   and get the documents and stuff like that.
[02:51:13.180 --> 02:51:17.180]   Initially, the first demonstration was told
[02:51:17.180 --> 02:51:25.220]   that if they come any closer, weapons would be used.
[02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:27.420]   So they disappeared and then they came back.
[02:51:27.420 --> 02:51:32.620]   I don't know, somebody in that office called Berlin
[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:35.060]   and said, "What are we gonna do?
[02:51:35.060 --> 02:51:37.140]   "Are we allowed to use force?"
[02:51:37.140 --> 02:51:39.060]   And the answer came back that Gorbachev said,
[02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:40.260]   "Absolutely not."
[02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:44.700]   And so this is where Putin, all of a sudden,
[02:51:44.700 --> 02:51:47.540]   he was at one point a member of the greatest,
[02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:50.660]   the most powerful intelligence organization in the world,
[02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:52.860]   and all of a sudden he was powerless
[02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:57.860]   and he had to watch how, this was a defeat, big one.
[02:51:57.860 --> 02:52:05.980]   - It's supposedly a powerful intelligence agency cowering,
[02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:10.060]   sort of crawling back into a position of weakness.
[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:12.700]   - And he probably promised himself never again.
[02:52:12.700 --> 02:52:14.260]   Russia needs to be great again.
[02:52:14.260 --> 02:52:20.340]   - The KGB, FSB, Russia, the Russian Empire
[02:52:20.340 --> 02:52:22.380]   needs to rise again.
[02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:24.900]   And that there's a feeling for him that that's,
[02:52:24.900 --> 02:52:27.300]   as he talks about the collapse of the Soviet Union
[02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:32.300]   being a great tragedy, there's a feeling like that was,
[02:52:32.300 --> 02:52:38.580]   that was like never again.
[02:52:38.580 --> 02:52:43.580]   - Yeah, and I believe that he has a strong conviction
[02:52:43.580 --> 02:52:48.740]   that, I don't know if he's religious,
[02:52:48.740 --> 02:52:52.100]   he carries a cross now, but I don't know what that means,
[02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:56.420]   but somehow, but that it's the destiny
[02:52:56.420 --> 02:52:59.100]   of the Russian nation to be great.
[02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:04.100]   And that is sort of, whether it's determined by God
[02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:08.380]   or some higher power, that is very important for him.
[02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:12.860]   - Of course, that nationalist idea is one
[02:53:12.860 --> 02:53:17.740]   that Americans share as well, and it could help
[02:53:17.740 --> 02:53:19.820]   a nation flourish, so by itself
[02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:21.380]   is not necessarily a bad thing.
[02:53:21.380 --> 02:53:24.040]   It's how it manifests itself is the question.
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:29.540]   - Well, one other thing, if I were to get a chat
[02:53:29.540 --> 02:53:34.540]   with the Ukrainian president, I would ask him
[02:53:36.700 --> 02:53:41.700]   how many lives, what is the equation
[02:53:41.700 --> 02:53:45.140]   between giving up some land and how many lives
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:47.740]   are worth this land?
[02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:52.260]   - And it's a good way to phrase the question.
[02:53:52.260 --> 02:53:55.460]   Of course, that question gets you killed in Ukraine.
[02:53:55.460 --> 02:53:59.380]   But because there's another part of that equation,
[02:53:59.380 --> 02:54:02.540]   which is it's not just land versus lives.
[02:54:02.540 --> 02:54:07.540]   It's the sovereignty, the knowledge that you're free
[02:54:07.540 --> 02:54:10.460]   and you're self-determined.
[02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:14.060]   And it's not about fighting for the particular land.
[02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:19.060]   It's saying we are messed up, corrupt,
[02:54:19.060 --> 02:54:25.740]   we have problems, it's a messy world, but it's our world.
[02:54:25.740 --> 02:54:31.020]   I think Stephen Crane has a poem about a man
[02:54:31.020 --> 02:54:35.140]   eating his own heart, and he was asked,
[02:54:35.140 --> 02:54:35.980]   "How does it taste?"
[02:54:35.980 --> 02:54:38.260]   And he said, "It's bitter, but I like it
[02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:41.260]   "because it is bitter and because it is my heart."
[02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:43.500]   And that there's a sense of like, I want,
[02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:47.780]   this is not just about land, this is our nation.
[02:54:47.780 --> 02:54:52.180]   The same love of nation that Putin has for Russia,
[02:54:52.180 --> 02:54:55.380]   the greater Russia, this vision of this great empire,
[02:54:55.380 --> 02:54:57.700]   I believe Ukraine does as well.
[02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:01.180]   Not every, there's levels to this game,
[02:55:01.180 --> 02:55:05.140]   and Ukrainian people are some of the proudest people
[02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:08.260]   throughout the history of the 20th century,
[02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:10.820]   throughout the history of Earth.
[02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:12.140]   The Polish people are proud people.
[02:55:12.140 --> 02:55:15.600]   You can just see in World War II,
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:20.600]   the people who said, "Fuck you, you're not having this.
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:23.100]   "We will die to the last man."
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:25.340]   There's different cultures that kind of
[02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:28.500]   really hold their ground, and Ukrainian people are that.
[02:55:29.020 --> 02:55:33.260]   - I have to admit, in that respect, I'm a bit of a coward.
[02:55:33.260 --> 02:55:36.540]   I could not do what Zelensky has been doing.
[02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:45.620]   I would sort of try to find a way to carve out
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:51.820]   something that I can live with.
[02:55:51.820 --> 02:55:56.820]   However, if that force, that evil force,
[02:55:56.820 --> 02:55:59.180]   gets to my family-- - Right.
[02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:01.180]   There's lines. - Yes.
[02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:02.020]   - That's right.
[02:56:02.020 --> 02:56:05.660]   You become the world's bravest man
[02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:07.860]   if somebody crosses that line. - Oh yeah.
[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:13.340]   - You mentioned something about you've not been to Moscow
[02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:18.340]   back, and that it might not be safe for you to travel there.
[02:56:18.340 --> 02:56:19.160]   - Yes.
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:24.620]   - Can you speak to the nature of that?
[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:29.620]   As somebody that successfully got out of the KGB,
[02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:33.100]   how are you still alive?
[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:35.860]   - A number of reasons.
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:40.860]   First of all, when my story became public,
[02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:44.020]   that was six years ago, I was pretty old.
[02:56:44.020 --> 02:56:49.900]   The folks that may have a personal interest,
[02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:53.180]   or may have had a personal interest in doing me harm,
[02:56:53.180 --> 02:56:54.940]   most of them don't live anymore.
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:56:56.060]   All right, that's number one.
[02:56:56.060 --> 02:57:01.060]   Number two, I did not, I hired hand, a German.
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:04.300]   I did not betray the motherland.
[02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:09.300]   That's a crime that is punished by death.
[02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:10.720]   You betray the motherland.
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:18.640]   And the other thing is,
[02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:25.260]   you know that these kinds of operations to assassination
[02:57:25.260 --> 02:57:30.020]   in another country are very difficult to plan and implement.
[02:57:30.020 --> 02:57:33.820]   And if there's a list of people that they don't like,
[02:57:33.820 --> 02:57:36.700]   I may not be at the very top.
[02:57:36.700 --> 02:57:40.260]   Having said that, if I wind up, say, in Moscow,
[02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:41.980]   or even in countries like Turkey,
[02:57:41.980 --> 02:57:44.860]   where there's a lot of lawlessness,
[02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:48.860]   accidents can easily be arranged,
[02:57:48.860 --> 02:57:51.820]   and that's just sending another message.
[02:57:51.820 --> 02:57:56.820]   You know, it's like, you know, we can do a lot of things.
[02:57:56.820 --> 02:57:58.820]   - Powerful. - Yes.
[02:57:58.820 --> 02:57:59.980]   - Do you think it's safe for me
[02:57:59.980 --> 02:58:01.740]   to travel in Russia and Ukraine?
[02:58:01.740 --> 02:58:08.740]   - I think you know very well
[02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:11.100]   how to communicate in both countries.
[02:58:11.100 --> 02:58:13.140]   You know, you've shown this in this interaction,
[02:58:13.140 --> 02:58:17.700]   that you have a lot of empathy
[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:19.220]   for the people you'll be talking with,
[02:58:19.220 --> 02:58:21.220]   and empathy means good understanding
[02:58:21.220 --> 02:58:22.740]   where they're coming from.
[02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:25.680]   And that there are lines that you can't cross.
[02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:27.980]   Like the question that I was gonna ask Zelensky,
[02:58:27.980 --> 02:58:29.780]   who I'm not gonna ask, good for you.
[02:58:29.780 --> 02:58:30.980]   (laughing)
[02:58:30.980 --> 02:58:33.220]   - Yeah, isn't that the funny thing about this world?
[02:58:33.220 --> 02:58:34.980]   There's lines, there's lines everywhere.
[02:58:34.980 --> 02:58:37.100]   Even in love, even in personal relationships,
[02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:39.700]   there's lines you should not cross.
[02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:42.100]   How did you finally get caught?
[02:58:42.100 --> 02:58:44.500]   - I resigned in 1988.
[02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:46.060]   - Well, let's actually talk about that.
[02:58:46.060 --> 02:58:50.260]   There was a, resigned, there's warning signs.
[02:58:50.260 --> 02:58:53.340]   There's yet another choice, yet another crossroads.
[02:58:53.340 --> 02:58:54.420]   - Yes, okay.
[02:58:54.420 --> 02:58:57.500]   - What was the calculation, what was the choice to be made?
[02:58:57.500 --> 02:59:02.420]   - To give a little background, it was 1988,
[02:59:02.420 --> 02:59:06.140]   and I thought they would,
[02:59:06.140 --> 02:59:12.100]   my time in the US would soon end,
[02:59:12.100 --> 02:59:14.980]   because I thought 10 to 12 years,
[02:59:14.980 --> 02:59:17.140]   it was already past 10 years.
[02:59:17.140 --> 02:59:20.660]   There was no indication that they indicated,
[02:59:20.660 --> 02:59:23.380]   that they said, you're done.
[02:59:23.380 --> 02:59:28.380]   But in December of 1988, I got this one thing
[02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:29.940]   that I never wanted to see.
[02:59:29.940 --> 02:59:32.020]   So we had a system of signals
[02:59:32.020 --> 02:59:38.500]   that either one of those diplomat agents
[02:59:38.500 --> 02:59:43.100]   could set at a spot that I passed by every day,
[02:59:43.940 --> 02:59:46.580]   or I could set where they would pass by,
[02:59:46.580 --> 02:59:48.540]   like on their way from where they lived
[02:59:48.540 --> 02:59:52.060]   to the United Nations, for instance, who would just drive.
[02:59:52.060 --> 02:59:57.060]   So, and mine was, the signal spot for me was
[02:59:57.060 --> 03:00:02.740]   on a support beam for the elevated atrium in Queens.
[03:00:02.740 --> 03:00:08.220]   And it was morning in December that I walked by there
[03:00:08.220 --> 03:00:11.300]   and routinely look at it, and I never expected anything.
[03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:12.860]   And there was this red dot,
[03:00:12.860 --> 03:00:16.340]   it was about the size of my fist with a red paint.
[03:00:16.340 --> 03:00:20.540]   And since you have done it already,
[03:00:20.540 --> 03:00:23.460]   I think I can curse in this moment,
[03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:26.740]   because it's the only way I can really indicate
[03:00:26.740 --> 03:00:29.600]   how I felt, I said, oh shit.
[03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:31.460]   Because that was the danger signal.
[03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:34.780]   There was like, you are in severe danger
[03:00:34.780 --> 03:00:37.540]   of, and you need to get out of the country
[03:00:37.540 --> 03:00:38.940]   as soon as possible.
[03:00:38.940 --> 03:00:42.220]   There was a protocol that I was supposed to follow.
[03:00:42.220 --> 03:00:44.380]   I wasn't even supposed to go home.
[03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:48.160]   I just needed to, was supposed to get my reserve documents
[03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:53.160]   that I had hidden in a park in the Bronx,
[03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:56.840]   and make a beeline to the Canadian border.
[03:00:56.840 --> 03:00:59.380]   I wasn't ready.
[03:00:59.380 --> 03:01:01.420]   So I just like ignored this thing.
[03:01:01.420 --> 03:01:05.140]   I mean, I couldn't ignore it, but I went on to work.
[03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:07.980]   Got on the A train, went to work,
[03:01:07.980 --> 03:01:10.340]   and then went to my cubicle and stared
[03:01:10.340 --> 03:01:11.660]   at the computer screen all day,
[03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:12.740]   because I couldn't think.
[03:01:12.740 --> 03:01:14.260]   I could think only about what to do,
[03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:15.700]   what to do, what to do.
[03:01:15.700 --> 03:01:18.900]   The reason for this indecisiveness was that
[03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:22.100]   I was a father at the time.
[03:01:22.100 --> 03:01:26.460]   I was, my little girl by the name of Chelsea
[03:01:26.460 --> 03:01:27.780]   was 18 months old.
[03:01:27.780 --> 03:01:33.660]   And I was there when she was born.
[03:01:33.660 --> 03:01:38.660]   I took her to her dorm.
[03:01:38.660 --> 03:01:40.540]   I watched her grow up.
[03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:43.860]   I watched her take the first steps
[03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:47.060]   and always look at me with these big eyes,
[03:01:47.060 --> 03:01:48.260]   lovingly look at me.
[03:01:48.260 --> 03:01:53.260]   And that is when I started my re-entry
[03:01:53.260 --> 03:01:55.500]   into the human race,
[03:01:55.500 --> 03:01:59.460]   because I just fell in love with this girl.
[03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:03.220]   That's when love came back,
[03:02:03.220 --> 03:02:05.600]   and it was completely unexpected.
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:10.220]   And there's a lot of fathers who understand,
[03:02:10.220 --> 03:02:11.740]   particularly fathers of girls
[03:02:11.740 --> 03:02:14.740]   who understand what happened there.
[03:02:14.740 --> 03:02:18.100]   And I still thought I need to go back
[03:02:18.100 --> 03:02:22.740]   because there was probably some danger,
[03:02:22.740 --> 03:02:26.180]   but I hadn't figured out how to take care of the girl.
[03:02:26.180 --> 03:02:30.220]   I'd leave her, but maybe she need to have a good life
[03:02:30.220 --> 03:02:32.300]   and grow up and have a chance.
[03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:35.500]   And her mother, she was from South America.
[03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:37.180]   She had a fourth grade education
[03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:41.220]   that would have not worked very well.
[03:02:41.220 --> 03:02:44.300]   So I played for time.
[03:02:44.300 --> 03:02:47.940]   I obviously, I could be sick.
[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:50.180]   I couldn't, you know, I could be in a hospital.
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:51.660]   There was a precedent where I was sick,
[03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:54.960]   where I couldn't communicate for about three weeks.
[03:02:54.960 --> 03:02:59.140]   So I just did nothing.
[03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:01.020]   That was on a Monday.
[03:03:01.020 --> 03:03:05.940]   On a Thursday was my regular shortwave transmission.
[03:03:05.940 --> 03:03:10.940]   I listened and they explained a little in a few sentences.
[03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:15.060]   We have reason to believe that the FBI is on your case.
[03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:19.260]   You need to execute the emergency procedure.
[03:03:19.260 --> 03:03:20.660]   Come home right away.
[03:03:20.660 --> 03:03:25.660]   I still had some time because the radio could be broken
[03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:28.500]   or the transmission was bad
[03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:30.020]   or I still could be in a hospital, right?
[03:03:30.020 --> 03:03:34.380]   So I gave myself some more time.
[03:03:34.380 --> 03:03:39.380]   And then something happened where they forced my hand.
[03:03:39.380 --> 03:03:45.260]   And this is the only time that a Soviet agent
[03:03:45.260 --> 03:03:49.860]   was anywhere near me on the territory of the United States.
[03:03:49.860 --> 03:03:52.220]   So I'm waiting for the A train
[03:03:52.220 --> 03:03:57.220]   on a dark morning still in Queens.
[03:03:57.220 --> 03:04:02.060]   And there's this man,
[03:04:02.060 --> 03:04:04.860]   this short man in a black trench coat
[03:04:04.860 --> 03:04:07.120]   comes up to me from my right
[03:04:07.120 --> 03:04:09.380]   and he whispers into my ears,
[03:04:09.380 --> 03:04:12.780]   you gotta come back or else you're dead.
[03:04:12.780 --> 03:04:14.340]   I can't imitate the Russian accent.
[03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:15.620]   That was a Russian accent.
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:20.580]   And it was a pretty strong accent.
[03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:25.580]   The you're dead phrase can have two meanings.
[03:04:25.580 --> 03:04:28.420]   And an American would have said,
[03:04:28.420 --> 03:04:31.460]   or else you're busted or else you get arrested
[03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:34.180]   or else you're dead is very strong.
[03:04:34.180 --> 03:04:38.580]   So now you have to take it seriously to some degree
[03:04:38.580 --> 03:04:43.580]   because I know that they had a history of assassinating
[03:04:43.580 --> 03:04:46.220]   or at least trying to assassinate defectors.
[03:04:46.220 --> 03:04:51.220]   So that obviously raised the stakes a little bit.
[03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:54.640]   But I just talked myself into believing
[03:04:54.640 --> 03:04:57.760]   this was just a bad phrasing.
[03:04:59.060 --> 03:05:02.260]   But at this point I knew and they knew
[03:05:02.260 --> 03:05:03.840]   that we both knew, right?
[03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:04.980]   So there was no more guessing.
[03:05:04.980 --> 03:05:07.900]   He found me, he talked to me, I know.
[03:05:07.900 --> 03:05:09.060]   So now I had to act.
[03:05:09.060 --> 03:05:13.420]   So in the next radiogram I was asked
[03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:17.060]   to execute a dead drop operation
[03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:21.720]   where they would give me money and a passport.
[03:05:21.720 --> 03:05:27.620]   And that was in a park on Staten Island.
[03:05:27.660 --> 03:05:31.940]   It was a location that I found and I described.
[03:05:31.940 --> 03:05:36.940]   And I was always praised for my ability
[03:05:36.940 --> 03:05:41.520]   to describe spots that are easy to find.
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:43.180]   So that was a given.
[03:05:43.180 --> 03:05:46.580]   And the only thing that was different
[03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:47.940]   in this for this operation,
[03:05:47.940 --> 03:05:50.980]   they scheduled it for the dark.
[03:05:50.980 --> 03:05:53.660]   All right, but it was still no problem
[03:05:53.660 --> 03:05:57.180]   because it was in a park and a couple of,
[03:05:57.180 --> 03:06:02.180]   about 100 yards in by next to a fallen tree.
[03:06:02.180 --> 03:06:05.940]   Would be hard to miss.
[03:06:05.940 --> 03:06:09.700]   So I go to Staten Island and I read the signal
[03:06:09.700 --> 03:06:14.700]   that said I put the container in the drop.
[03:06:14.700 --> 03:06:16.340]   That was the protocol.
[03:06:16.340 --> 03:06:18.980]   There's a signal that the person
[03:06:18.980 --> 03:06:23.980]   who hands over something puts at a spot
[03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:27.380]   not too far from the spot itself.
[03:06:27.380 --> 03:06:29.980]   That means I would go in and just pick it up.
[03:06:29.980 --> 03:06:34.980]   The reason I actually went to pick up this container
[03:06:34.980 --> 03:06:38.860]   because there was money in it.
[03:06:38.860 --> 03:06:41.580]   So I didn't have to make a decision yet.
[03:06:41.580 --> 03:06:44.140]   Okay, I could throw away the passport.
[03:06:44.140 --> 03:06:46.220]   It was like I was still trying to figure out
[03:06:46.220 --> 03:06:48.160]   what to do, what to do, what to do.
[03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:50.700]   So I get to the spot, I get to the tree
[03:06:50.700 --> 03:06:53.380]   and I had a flashlight with me.
[03:06:53.380 --> 03:06:56.140]   The park, there was no way in the park.
[03:06:56.140 --> 03:06:58.820]   Even during the day, this park was not,
[03:06:58.820 --> 03:07:00.820]   it was more almost like a little forest.
[03:07:00.820 --> 03:07:06.420]   And I don't see the container.
[03:07:06.420 --> 03:07:09.960]   It was supposed to be a crushed oil can.
[03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:12.400]   Pretty sizable, hard to miss.
[03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:16.100]   And I do a double take and I look again
[03:07:16.100 --> 03:07:18.460]   and I look around, I look around a little more,
[03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:20.340]   see if they misplaced it.
[03:07:20.340 --> 03:07:21.460]   Can't find it.
[03:07:23.260 --> 03:07:26.420]   It's the only one that one of those operations failed.
[03:07:26.420 --> 03:07:33.580]   And that just doesn't make a lot of sense.
[03:07:33.580 --> 03:07:35.500]   So when as I'm walking away from this,
[03:07:35.500 --> 03:07:37.640]   like sort of numb emotionally,
[03:07:37.640 --> 03:07:42.780]   I said to myself, I'm staying.
[03:07:42.780 --> 03:07:45.660]   - Yeah.
[03:07:45.660 --> 03:07:46.500]   - That decision--
[03:07:46.500 --> 03:07:49.100]   - Some kind of signal, some kind of a muse
[03:07:49.100 --> 03:07:50.220]   just spoke to you.
[03:07:50.220 --> 03:07:53.820]   - That decision was made for me.
[03:07:53.820 --> 03:07:55.460]   Now you know that I'm a Christian now
[03:07:55.460 --> 03:07:58.120]   and I think that was like, God told me this.
[03:07:58.120 --> 03:08:01.860]   - But it was certain there.
[03:08:01.860 --> 03:08:02.700]   It was right there.
[03:08:02.700 --> 03:08:03.540]   - That was it.
[03:08:03.540 --> 03:08:04.360]   - That was it.
[03:08:04.360 --> 03:08:05.200]   - That was it.
[03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:10.200]   And so what I did to, well first of all,
[03:08:10.200 --> 03:08:16.940]   divine intervention helped me to find a good explanation.
[03:08:16.940 --> 03:08:19.840]   I sent them my last letter with secret writing.
[03:08:19.840 --> 03:08:24.380]   I communicated to them, I said,
[03:08:24.380 --> 03:08:26.540]   I wish I could come but I can't
[03:08:26.540 --> 03:08:30.280]   because I have contracted HIV/AIDS.
[03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:34.140]   That was the best lie ever
[03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:37.380]   because nobody wanted to have AIDS in their country.
[03:08:37.380 --> 03:08:39.700]   Those days it was a death sentence, right?
[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:44.100]   And I knew, we had conversations when I was back in Moscow
[03:08:44.100 --> 03:08:46.860]   how they were snickering about what's going on
[03:08:46.860 --> 03:08:49.700]   in the United States, that depraved culture
[03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:52.540]   and you see they're killing each other.
[03:08:52.540 --> 03:08:55.980]   - And the depraved culture took over your being
[03:08:55.980 --> 03:08:56.820]   and how you're saying--
[03:08:56.820 --> 03:08:59.540]   - Yes, and I was convincing enough,
[03:08:59.540 --> 03:09:03.540]   I even traced it back to a girlfriend I had once
[03:09:03.540 --> 03:09:06.260]   that I actually reported on that she,
[03:09:06.260 --> 03:09:11.260]   I interacted with this lady who had a boyfriend
[03:09:11.260 --> 03:09:13.860]   at one point who was a drug addict
[03:09:13.860 --> 03:09:15.980]   and she was infected and she infected me.
[03:09:16.820 --> 03:09:19.620]   So they believed it, they sent,
[03:09:19.620 --> 03:09:23.220]   and I asked them to give my dollar savings
[03:09:23.220 --> 03:09:24.900]   to my German family.
[03:09:24.900 --> 03:09:30.700]   They gave them some but they told my family
[03:09:30.700 --> 03:09:33.300]   that I already passed away, that I'm dead.
[03:09:33.300 --> 03:09:35.060]   They believed it, 100%.
[03:09:35.060 --> 03:09:38.580]   And I guess the agent who took the money
[03:09:38.580 --> 03:09:40.260]   took half of it for himself.
[03:09:40.260 --> 03:09:45.240]   So that was it and the next three months
[03:09:45.240 --> 03:09:50.240]   I made sure that I wasn't reliably at the same spot
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:53.860]   in the same time frame.
[03:09:53.860 --> 03:09:57.980]   So I went to work in different paths at different times
[03:09:57.980 --> 03:10:02.660]   just to, you know, just as a safety measure so to speak
[03:10:02.660 --> 03:10:07.660]   and not huge but you know, it kept me,
[03:10:07.660 --> 03:10:12.180]   allowed me to keep my sanity.
[03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:16.560]   And obviously after I sent the letter
[03:10:16.560 --> 03:10:20.640]   I threw the shortwave radio in the Hudson River,
[03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:23.160]   destroyed the one time pads that I still had
[03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:28.000]   so I was now ready to--
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:28.920]   - For a new life.
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:31.960]   - For a new life and live out my life
[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:36.800]   as an American undiscovered but you know,
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:40.780]   starting to work on my version of the American dream.
[03:10:42.140 --> 03:10:47.140]   And the first action was, was telling my wife,
[03:10:47.140 --> 03:10:50.920]   the mother of this child, you know,
[03:10:50.920 --> 03:10:53.920]   she always wanted to have a house
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:56.680]   and I said, you know what, we should buy a house.
[03:10:56.680 --> 03:11:00.280]   And a year later we moved into the suburbs
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:02.840]   and then I said we should have another child
[03:11:02.840 --> 03:11:04.500]   and we had another child.
[03:11:04.500 --> 03:11:07.760]   So and I had a career, I did pretty well.
[03:11:09.360 --> 03:11:13.140]   I moved a couple of times, wound up in a McMansion
[03:11:13.140 --> 03:11:17.340]   but before that my second house was actually
[03:11:17.340 --> 03:11:19.340]   in Pennsylvania, in rural Pennsylvania
[03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:24.340]   and this is where I was discovered by the FBI.
[03:11:24.340 --> 03:11:27.780]   And how did they know about me?
[03:11:27.780 --> 03:11:32.060]   If it hadn't been for this defector,
[03:11:32.060 --> 03:11:37.060]   Vasily Mitrokhin who was an archivist in the KGB archives,
[03:11:37.060 --> 03:11:38.940]   he was actually pretty high level,
[03:11:38.940 --> 03:11:42.100]   he was in charge of the relocation of the archive
[03:11:42.100 --> 03:11:45.380]   from Lubyanka to Yasenovo.
[03:11:45.380 --> 03:11:52.380]   And he really hated, he had reason to believe
[03:11:52.380 --> 03:11:54.540]   he hated the Soviet system.
[03:11:54.540 --> 03:11:59.760]   I think I remember that his son was quite ill
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:01.700]   and he could have gotten treatment in England
[03:12:01.700 --> 03:12:05.580]   and he was not allowed to travel to England with his son.
[03:12:05.580 --> 03:12:10.580]   So his hatred, he tried to figure out what to do
[03:12:10.580 --> 03:12:12.380]   and how to do damage to that system.
[03:12:12.380 --> 03:12:17.380]   So he started copying notes, little slips of paper,
[03:12:17.380 --> 03:12:20.660]   handwritten that he smuggled out in his underwear
[03:12:20.660 --> 03:12:23.820]   and his socks over the years.
[03:12:23.820 --> 03:12:25.900]   And then he transcribed them with a typewriter
[03:12:25.900 --> 03:12:30.140]   and then put the pieces of paper
[03:12:31.340 --> 03:12:33.580]   into some kind of a container
[03:12:33.580 --> 03:12:37.340]   and buried this in his stature.
[03:12:37.340 --> 03:12:42.340]   It was, I believe, in 1992 when he showed up,
[03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:45.620]   that was already, the Soviet Union was gone.
[03:12:45.620 --> 03:12:48.780]   So he showed up at the US embassy in Moscow
[03:12:48.780 --> 03:12:51.680]   and told him what he had and it was on a weekend
[03:12:51.680 --> 03:12:53.780]   and apparently there was a junior person in charge
[03:12:53.780 --> 03:12:55.660]   and he said, "You know what, what you got,
[03:12:55.660 --> 03:12:57.860]   "we are not interested in, it's really old."
[03:12:57.860 --> 03:13:00.220]   (laughing)
[03:13:00.220 --> 03:13:02.420]   That's a career limiting move, right?
[03:13:02.420 --> 03:13:06.660]   Because Vasily Mitrokhin then made his way
[03:13:06.660 --> 03:13:11.660]   to one of the Baltic republics and contacted MI6
[03:13:11.660 --> 03:13:17.100]   and they said, "Come on in, old fellow,
[03:13:17.100 --> 03:13:19.740]   "have a cup of tea." (laughing)
[03:13:19.740 --> 03:13:22.940]   And so they managed to get this stuff out of the dacha
[03:13:22.940 --> 03:13:25.980]   and get it to England and eventually,
[03:13:27.580 --> 03:13:29.220]   MI6 shared it with the FBI
[03:13:29.220 --> 03:13:32.700]   and there wasn't a whole lot of information about me,
[03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:33.860]   it was very, very little.
[03:13:33.860 --> 03:13:37.300]   It was like there's a person by the name of Jack Barsky
[03:13:37.300 --> 03:13:41.200]   who is an illegal operating in the northeast
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:42.180]   of the United States.
[03:13:42.180 --> 03:13:45.260]   Now, if it was Jim Miller, they wouldn't have found me,
[03:13:45.260 --> 03:13:47.660]   Jack Barsky was easy to find.
[03:13:47.660 --> 03:13:50.580]   So they checked social security
[03:13:50.580 --> 03:13:55.460]   and Jack Barsky had gotten his social security card
[03:13:55.460 --> 03:13:58.740]   at the age of 33, bingo, okay?
[03:13:58.740 --> 03:14:02.580]   All they knew though was that I wasn't illegal,
[03:14:02.580 --> 03:14:04.020]   that I was still living there.
[03:14:04.020 --> 03:14:06.420]   They didn't know whether I was active, inactive.
[03:14:06.420 --> 03:14:09.380]   And the other thing that they knew
[03:14:09.380 --> 03:14:12.260]   that I was a really, really well-trained agent
[03:14:12.260 --> 03:14:14.940]   'cause I was still there, right? (laughing)
[03:14:14.940 --> 03:14:19.940]   So they took, I think, almost three years
[03:14:19.940 --> 03:14:22.740]   to investigate me, watch me from a distance
[03:14:22.740 --> 03:14:25.940]   because if I was still active,
[03:14:25.940 --> 03:14:30.060]   I would have found out that somebody's investigating me.
[03:14:30.060 --> 03:14:33.020]   - So you started being less and less active in terms of--
[03:14:33.020 --> 03:14:34.660]   - Oh, I stopped completely.
[03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:36.900]   - What I mean is-- - Oh, surveillance detection.
[03:14:36.900 --> 03:14:38.100]   - Yes, surveillance detection.
[03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:40.380]   - After three months, I stopped altogether.
[03:14:40.380 --> 03:14:41.780]   Yeah, good point.
[03:14:41.780 --> 03:14:43.940]   - And FBI is still very careful.
[03:14:43.940 --> 03:14:45.020]   - They were very careful.
[03:14:45.020 --> 03:14:49.580]   They pretty much watched me and at one point,
[03:14:49.580 --> 03:14:51.380]   I had a house in the country with one neighbor.
[03:14:51.380 --> 03:14:53.980]   At one point, that house was for sale,
[03:14:53.980 --> 03:14:57.500]   so the FBI bought it and they put a couple of agents there
[03:14:57.500 --> 03:14:59.660]   and just didn't keep a closer eye on me.
[03:14:59.660 --> 03:15:05.980]   There was no indication that I was still active,
[03:15:05.980 --> 03:15:08.500]   but they were still cautious.
[03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:14.180]   But at one point, they were able to plant a bug
[03:15:14.180 --> 03:15:16.380]   in my kitchen, a listening device.
[03:15:18.020 --> 03:15:23.020]   And my wife and I didn't get along very well.
[03:15:23.020 --> 03:15:25.700]   There was a lot of friction
[03:15:25.700 --> 03:15:28.420]   and she was constantly complaining about things
[03:15:28.420 --> 03:15:30.580]   and I got sick and tired of it.
[03:15:30.580 --> 03:15:32.860]   And one day, we had an argument in the kitchen
[03:15:32.860 --> 03:15:39.060]   and I chose to deploy the nuclear option.
[03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:41.820]   (laughing)
[03:15:41.820 --> 03:15:46.820]   And that is telling her what I sacrificed to be with her,
[03:15:47.020 --> 03:15:51.300]   so she would understand that I am there on her side.
[03:15:51.300 --> 03:15:52.180]   I'm supporting her.
[03:15:52.180 --> 03:15:53.980]   If something doesn't quite fit,
[03:15:53.980 --> 03:15:56.500]   it is not because I don't love the both of them,
[03:15:56.500 --> 03:15:59.220]   Chelsea and Penelope.
[03:15:59.220 --> 03:16:04.020]   So when I said that, the listening device was active,
[03:16:04.020 --> 03:16:07.160]   so the FBI was hearing my confession.
[03:16:07.160 --> 03:16:11.060]   I was once a KGB agent, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[03:16:11.060 --> 03:16:16.060]   and I quit because of an unstable situation.
[03:16:16.100 --> 03:16:19.740]   And stayed here because of you and Chelsea.
[03:16:19.740 --> 03:16:24.620]   And that also made it clear to the FBI
[03:16:24.620 --> 03:16:26.220]   that I wasn't active anymore.
[03:16:26.220 --> 03:16:27.100]   They had both of that.
[03:16:27.100 --> 03:16:31.860]   So now, they knew an attempt to turn me
[03:16:31.860 --> 03:16:36.860]   would have been useless because you turn somebody
[03:16:36.860 --> 03:16:38.100]   who's active.
[03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:41.860]   But they figured there was enough reason
[03:16:41.860 --> 03:16:46.860]   to treat me nicely because they figured
[03:16:46.860 --> 03:16:51.900]   I had a lot of information that was as aged as it was,
[03:16:51.900 --> 03:16:55.060]   but it was still important for the FBI to get to know.
[03:16:55.060 --> 03:17:01.060]   And so, one day, it was a Friday evening,
[03:17:01.060 --> 03:17:06.660]   I'm driving back home from the office
[03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:11.660]   and I'm being stopped by a state security guard.
[03:17:12.340 --> 03:17:14.180]   State police.
[03:17:14.180 --> 03:17:18.060]   As I'm going through the toll,
[03:17:18.060 --> 03:17:22.620]   it's a bridge over the Hudson and they had to pay a toll.
[03:17:22.620 --> 03:17:26.300]   And he waved me, he got me right where I stopped
[03:17:26.300 --> 03:17:29.100]   and he said, "Could you please move over here?
[03:17:29.100 --> 03:17:31.100]   It's a routine traffic stop."
[03:17:31.100 --> 03:17:32.300]   Thought nothing of it.
[03:17:32.300 --> 03:17:36.340]   I had forgotten at that point that I once was a spy.
[03:17:36.340 --> 03:17:37.340]   It was gone.
[03:17:38.300 --> 03:17:42.500]   And then he said, "Could you please step out of the car?"
[03:17:42.500 --> 03:17:45.100]   That should have aroused my suspicion.
[03:17:45.100 --> 03:17:46.060]   That's unusual, right?
[03:17:46.060 --> 03:17:48.260]   Routine traffic stop.
[03:17:48.260 --> 03:17:49.620]   I mean, I did it, no problem.
[03:17:49.620 --> 03:17:52.540]   And then again, somebody came from the right,
[03:17:52.540 --> 03:17:57.540]   came into my view and he flipped his ID
[03:17:57.540 --> 03:18:00.580]   and he said, "FBI, we would like to have a talk with you."
[03:18:00.580 --> 03:18:04.860]   Now, this is my now friend Joe Riley,
[03:18:04.860 --> 03:18:09.860]   who actually is the, he's the godfather of Trinity,
[03:18:09.860 --> 03:18:10.900]   my last child.
[03:18:10.900 --> 03:18:15.900]   But anyway, he told me later that when I heard that phrase,
[03:18:15.900 --> 03:18:22.120]   all the blood left my face, I became totally white.
[03:18:22.120 --> 03:18:26.860]   But I recovered very quickly and he said it himself.
[03:18:26.860 --> 03:18:30.500]   So, they took me to a vehicle
[03:18:31.420 --> 03:18:35.300]   and there was another agent in the vehicle
[03:18:35.300 --> 03:18:38.140]   and he had a gun strapped to his ankle.
[03:18:38.140 --> 03:18:40.300]   So, it was pretty real.
[03:18:40.300 --> 03:18:44.740]   First question I had, so am I under arrest?
[03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:46.500]   And the answer was no.
[03:18:46.500 --> 03:18:50.420]   And then my instinct kicked in
[03:18:50.420 --> 03:18:55.260]   in my ability to operate very well
[03:18:55.260 --> 03:18:57.100]   under high pressure situations.
[03:18:57.100 --> 03:18:59.340]   And I asked him, "So, what took you so long?"
[03:19:01.220 --> 03:19:04.020]   You know, the intent of that was to
[03:19:04.020 --> 03:19:11.860]   defuse any kind of tension.
[03:19:11.860 --> 03:19:13.380]   - Yes. - And I saw a smile.
[03:19:13.380 --> 03:19:16.740]   - Instant friends.
[03:19:16.740 --> 03:19:21.740]   - Yeah, I knew that I had to make them like me.
[03:19:21.740 --> 03:19:28.180]   And I think by now I know I'm a pretty likable person.
[03:19:28.180 --> 03:19:29.060]   - I would say so.
[03:19:30.180 --> 03:19:34.020]   So, and when they took me to a motel,
[03:19:34.020 --> 03:19:37.020]   which they had rented, there was two wings
[03:19:37.020 --> 03:19:45.340]   at a right angle, they bought all the rooms in one wing
[03:19:45.340 --> 03:19:49.620]   and they had a guard at each end of that wing
[03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:51.660]   and they took me in the middle.
[03:19:51.660 --> 03:19:54.500]   And there were some props there,
[03:19:54.500 --> 03:19:57.380]   some binders with labels.
[03:19:57.380 --> 03:20:00.860]   And I immediately thought, "This is pretty silly,"
[03:20:00.860 --> 03:20:04.700]   because what I noticed that the labels
[03:20:04.700 --> 03:20:07.460]   all referred back to my early years.
[03:20:07.460 --> 03:20:09.420]   I knew that they didn't know much else.
[03:20:09.420 --> 03:20:13.460]   So, I told Joe that afterwards
[03:20:13.460 --> 03:20:15.260]   and that was not a great idea.
[03:20:15.260 --> 03:20:20.260]   But anyway, but I volunteered.
[03:20:20.260 --> 03:20:21.500]   I made the following statement
[03:20:21.500 --> 03:20:24.180]   before we even started the interview.
[03:20:24.180 --> 03:20:26.620]   I said, "I know there's only one way for me
[03:20:26.620 --> 03:20:30.780]   "to and my family to have a chance to get through here
[03:20:30.780 --> 03:20:35.620]   "without much damages, if I'm completely 100% cooperative
[03:20:35.620 --> 03:20:40.460]   "and it's my intent to do exactly that."
[03:20:40.460 --> 03:20:43.620]   All right, so we spent about two hours in the interview.
[03:20:43.620 --> 03:20:46.140]   They allowed me to call my wife,
[03:20:46.140 --> 03:20:47.940]   tell her that I'm gonna be late.
[03:20:47.940 --> 03:20:51.100]   That indicated to me already that they would let me go.
[03:20:51.100 --> 03:20:52.900]   And after two hours, they let me go.
[03:20:54.820 --> 03:20:59.700]   But they had the area covered with a whole bunch of people.
[03:20:59.700 --> 03:21:04.020]   And the head of that team talked to me and he says,
[03:21:04.020 --> 03:21:06.860]   "If you think of running,
[03:21:06.860 --> 03:21:09.260]   "we got every intersection in this area covered.
[03:21:09.260 --> 03:21:10.340]   "You can't."
[03:21:10.340 --> 03:21:14.940]   I didn't say anything, but I had no thought of running.
[03:21:14.940 --> 03:21:21.500]   So, and that was the beginning of another phase of my life
[03:21:22.420 --> 03:21:25.380]   where I was cooperating with the FBI for quite a while
[03:21:25.380 --> 03:21:27.700]   and living still undercover for several years
[03:21:27.700 --> 03:21:30.340]   until I had real good documentation
[03:21:30.340 --> 03:21:33.660]   and became an American citizen seven years ago.
[03:21:33.660 --> 03:21:36.420]   - Today, seven years ago.
[03:21:36.420 --> 03:21:37.820]   So, it was recently.
[03:21:37.820 --> 03:21:39.700]   - Yeah, quite recent.
[03:21:39.700 --> 03:21:42.220]   The bureaucracy took a long time to figure out
[03:21:42.220 --> 03:21:47.220]   how to make me real and also not put me
[03:21:47.220 --> 03:21:51.420]   in these witness protection program,
[03:21:51.420 --> 03:21:56.420]   to keep my name and then just make everything official.
[03:21:56.420 --> 03:21:59.540]   So, for instance, I had to change my birth year
[03:21:59.540 --> 03:22:05.380]   simply because if I, Jack Barsky was born in 1944.
[03:22:05.380 --> 03:22:09.420]   If I kept 1944, the FBI would have helped me commit a crime
[03:22:09.420 --> 03:22:12.740]   because I would have collected social security
[03:22:12.740 --> 03:22:14.860]   of four years sooner.
[03:22:14.860 --> 03:22:17.180]   So, anyway.
[03:22:17.180 --> 03:22:18.020]   - Details of that name.
[03:22:18.020 --> 03:22:19.860]   - Yes, it took quite a while.
[03:22:19.860 --> 03:22:21.500]   And when I finally got the call
[03:22:21.500 --> 03:22:24.900]   from the office of Homeland Security,
[03:22:24.900 --> 03:22:30.380]   the lady says, "This is agent so-and-so
[03:22:30.380 --> 03:22:34.300]   from Homeland Security.
[03:22:34.300 --> 03:22:36.900]   Can you come to the office tomorrow?"
[03:22:36.900 --> 03:22:41.900]   And I said, "Let me look at my calendar."
[03:22:41.900 --> 03:22:44.820]   And then I said, "Wait a minute, what am I talking about?
[03:22:44.820 --> 03:22:46.860]   What time do you want me to be there?"
[03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:49.140]   Because I had waited for that moment for a long time
[03:22:49.140 --> 03:22:51.260]   and I was sworn in right then and there.
[03:22:51.260 --> 03:22:54.380]   It was a good feeling to walk out of there
[03:22:54.380 --> 03:22:57.060]   because I had a country again.
[03:22:57.060 --> 03:23:01.660]   And I love this country just as much as you said you love it
[03:23:01.660 --> 03:23:03.580]   with all its warts and its problems
[03:23:03.580 --> 03:23:05.340]   that we're going through right now.
[03:23:05.340 --> 03:23:11.060]   And then the last thing that changed my life again,
[03:23:11.060 --> 03:23:12.820]   and I don't wanna get into details
[03:23:12.820 --> 03:23:14.820]   because it's a little complicated story.
[03:23:14.820 --> 03:23:17.780]   I never wanted to be a public person.
[03:23:18.700 --> 03:23:23.700]   And then I was discovered through a number of dots
[03:23:23.700 --> 03:23:26.260]   that were unlikely to be connected.
[03:23:26.260 --> 03:23:27.620]   It had to do with a relative,
[03:23:27.620 --> 03:23:32.620]   with a half-brother of my wife who lives in Germany,
[03:23:32.620 --> 03:23:37.540]   was taken to Germany by his mother,
[03:23:37.540 --> 03:23:40.380]   who came to visit somebody, not us,
[03:23:40.380 --> 03:23:43.180]   but that somebody that he came to visit
[03:23:43.180 --> 03:23:45.660]   lived 50 miles from our house.
[03:23:45.740 --> 03:23:49.300]   And that my wife and this half-brother
[03:23:49.300 --> 03:23:51.940]   never met in person before.
[03:23:51.940 --> 03:23:54.820]   They knew about each other through social media.
[03:23:54.820 --> 03:23:56.540]   And when he found out my background,
[03:23:56.540 --> 03:24:01.540]   he was a conductor of the German railroad at the time.
[03:24:01.540 --> 03:24:03.860]   He said, "Oh, this is a big story.
[03:24:03.860 --> 03:24:05.980]   "I'm going to be big, big, big."
[03:24:05.980 --> 03:24:06.820]   (Roland laughs)
[03:24:06.820 --> 03:24:07.780]   Okay.
[03:24:07.780 --> 03:24:09.660]   Well, he happened to know this one person
[03:24:09.660 --> 03:24:14.180]   who happened to know one of the star reporters
[03:24:14.180 --> 03:24:15.700]   of Der Spiegel.
[03:24:15.700 --> 03:24:16.540]   - Hmm.
[03:24:16.540 --> 03:24:19.620]   - And after she did some research
[03:24:19.620 --> 03:24:23.860]   and determined that I was real, she was on my case.
[03:24:23.860 --> 03:24:26.700]   And she happened to know Steve Kroft,
[03:24:26.700 --> 03:24:28.500]   the guy from "60 Minutes."
[03:24:28.500 --> 03:24:29.780]   You see all these connections?
[03:24:29.780 --> 03:24:30.620]   I had nothing to do with it.
[03:24:30.620 --> 03:24:31.700]   - That's how life works.
[03:24:31.700 --> 03:24:34.220]   Dots get connected somehow, sometimes.
[03:24:34.220 --> 03:24:35.260]   - Yeah. - Most of us, it doesn't.
[03:24:35.260 --> 03:24:36.100]   - Stuff happens.
[03:24:36.100 --> 03:24:37.540]   - Stuff happens, you get lucky.
[03:24:37.540 --> 03:24:38.380]   - You don't know what's happening.
[03:24:38.380 --> 03:24:40.500]   - You've gotten lucky a few times in your life.
[03:24:40.500 --> 03:24:43.660]   - Yeah, I think I must be part Irish too.
[03:24:43.660 --> 03:24:45.220]   (Roland laughs)
[03:24:45.220 --> 03:24:50.220]   Yeah, so it's been an interesting ride.
[03:24:50.220 --> 03:24:55.780]   I'm just still shaking my head
[03:24:55.780 --> 03:24:57.700]   about all the stuff that happened.
[03:24:57.700 --> 03:24:58.660]   - Oh, it's been a fun one.
[03:24:58.660 --> 03:25:02.620]   Well, you wrote, "Because I'm allowed to leave behind
[03:25:02.620 --> 03:25:06.840]   "a documented legacy of my unusual life,
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:09.480]   "I'm praying that the legacy will be described
[03:25:09.480 --> 03:25:12.620]   "by a single word, love."
[03:25:12.620 --> 03:25:15.180]   So let us return to the thing we started
[03:25:15.180 --> 03:25:17.360]   the conversation with, which is love.
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:21.380]   What role does love play in this human condition,
[03:25:21.380 --> 03:25:24.940]   in your life and in our life here together?
[03:25:24.940 --> 03:25:29.940]   - I give you an answer by telling you
[03:25:29.940 --> 03:25:31.580]   what happened one day.
[03:25:31.580 --> 03:25:35.540]   I gave a presentation at Microsoft headquarters.
[03:25:35.540 --> 03:25:37.540]   (Roland laughs)
[03:25:37.540 --> 03:25:40.420]   - That's a strange beginning of a love story, but yes.
[03:25:40.420 --> 03:25:41.580]   - No, that's not a love story.
[03:25:41.580 --> 03:25:44.900]   And so there's this beautiful young lady
[03:25:44.900 --> 03:25:48.820]   sitting in the back and she's paying a lot of attention.
[03:25:48.820 --> 03:25:52.300]   Found out later that her job at Microsoft,
[03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:54.940]   her job title was storyteller.
[03:25:54.940 --> 03:25:57.940]   It's soft marketing, right?
[03:25:57.940 --> 03:25:59.260]   (Roland laughs)
[03:25:59.260 --> 03:26:00.740]   - Yeah, you could say that.
[03:26:00.740 --> 03:26:04.100]   - Yeah, but if you can't afford somebody like that,
[03:26:04.100 --> 03:26:05.420]   that's good.
[03:26:05.420 --> 03:26:10.420]   Anyway, she, question and answer,
[03:26:10.660 --> 03:26:12.580]   she raised her hand and she asked me,
[03:26:12.580 --> 03:26:16.540]   so all the things that you have done
[03:26:16.540 --> 03:26:17.980]   and you have experienced,
[03:26:17.980 --> 03:26:19.820]   what's the number one lesson
[03:26:19.820 --> 03:26:22.240]   you've taken away from your life?
[03:26:22.240 --> 03:26:25.260]   That was a new question for me.
[03:26:25.260 --> 03:26:27.620]   I've never been asked that question.
[03:26:27.620 --> 03:26:31.580]   And I thought about it for 20 seconds
[03:26:31.580 --> 03:26:34.740]   and then I came up with this phrase
[03:26:34.740 --> 03:26:36.920]   that we all know love conquers all.
[03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:40.520]   Because in my life it did.
[03:26:40.520 --> 03:26:41.360]   In the end.
[03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:47.780]   It's the strongest human emotion
[03:26:47.780 --> 03:26:51.060]   and that is what makes us human, really.
[03:26:51.060 --> 03:26:52.700]   - And you spoke about the,
[03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:55.460]   I mean, offline as I've spoken with you,
[03:26:55.460 --> 03:26:58.460]   it's clear to me how transformative,
[03:26:58.460 --> 03:27:01.940]   how powerful the life of your children
[03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:05.500]   or your daughters in your life and who you are
[03:27:05.500 --> 03:27:08.140]   and why you think life is beautiful
[03:27:08.140 --> 03:27:10.420]   and why you think this country is beautiful.
[03:27:10.420 --> 03:27:14.000]   - Now that I'm pretty mature,
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:16.440]   to put it mildly,
[03:27:16.440 --> 03:27:22.260]   I'm also more loving towards many more people.
[03:27:22.260 --> 03:27:26.660]   You know, these things like random acts of kindness
[03:27:26.660 --> 03:27:28.220]   for strangers, I do 'em.
[03:27:28.220 --> 03:27:29.340]   I'm looking for them now.
[03:27:29.340 --> 03:27:30.540]   And you know what?
[03:27:30.540 --> 03:27:31.460]   It's good for me.
[03:27:31.460 --> 03:27:34.260]   - Well, welcome to Texas
[03:27:34.260 --> 03:27:37.980]   because this random acts of kindness to strangers
[03:27:37.980 --> 03:27:39.540]   seems to be a way of life.
[03:27:40.540 --> 03:27:44.380]   Which is one of the reasons I love it here.
[03:27:44.380 --> 03:27:47.460]   It just reminds me why I love human beings
[03:27:47.460 --> 03:27:50.020]   is that there's just this warmth, this connection.
[03:27:50.020 --> 03:27:52.180]   - Yeah, and Georgia is the same thing.
[03:27:52.180 --> 03:27:54.100]   - Yeah, amen.
[03:27:54.100 --> 03:27:56.760]   Do you ever have any regrets?
[03:27:56.760 --> 03:28:00.140]   Looking back at life,
[03:28:00.140 --> 03:28:02.140]   do you wish you'd done something different?
[03:28:02.140 --> 03:28:04.380]   - Well, I could have,
[03:28:04.380 --> 03:28:08.940]   but then I would have had a different regret.
[03:28:08.940 --> 03:28:12.460]   I betrayed the wife, the German wife that I loved.
[03:28:12.460 --> 03:28:16.580]   I really did love her and I betrayed her.
[03:28:16.580 --> 03:28:21.580]   But if I don't betray her, then I betray the child.
[03:28:21.580 --> 03:28:27.300]   - That is a source of so much love for you now.
[03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:28.980]   So maybe your life is a kind of,
[03:28:28.980 --> 03:28:33.020]   you get to choose your regrets.
[03:28:33.020 --> 03:28:36.860]   You don't get to avoid them.
[03:28:36.860 --> 03:28:40.300]   It's a little bit of a strange way of putting it,
[03:28:40.300 --> 03:28:42.460]   but there's no other choice.
[03:28:42.460 --> 03:28:46.060]   I tell you what I don't regret,
[03:28:46.060 --> 03:28:48.700]   and that may be,
[03:28:48.700 --> 03:28:50.360]   you probably understand it now
[03:28:50.360 --> 03:28:51.940]   because you have enough background about me.
[03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:53.900]   I don't regret having lied to my mother
[03:28:53.900 --> 03:28:59.500]   because I had no really strong emotional relationship
[03:28:59.500 --> 03:29:00.540]   with her.
[03:29:00.540 --> 03:29:01.540]   She took care of me.
[03:29:01.540 --> 03:29:05.400]   She was proud of me, but we didn't hug.
[03:29:06.260 --> 03:29:10.640]   We didn't interact emotionally whatsoever.
[03:29:10.640 --> 03:29:15.420]   - So you don't feel like you betrayed that love that--
[03:29:15.420 --> 03:29:16.260]   - Well, I did.
[03:29:16.260 --> 03:29:21.260]   I know that she was looking for me until the day she died.
[03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:26.180]   She wrote a letter to President Gorbachev
[03:29:26.180 --> 03:29:28.040]   asking him for help to locate me.
[03:29:28.040 --> 03:29:33.800]   She checked with the Stasi.
[03:29:33.800 --> 03:29:38.800]   She just was like hell-bent on finding me
[03:29:38.800 --> 03:29:40.780]   and couldn't find me,
[03:29:40.780 --> 03:29:45.780]   so she passed away without knowing what happened to me.
[03:29:45.780 --> 03:29:50.160]   Now, there was this rumor that was flying around,
[03:29:50.160 --> 03:29:52.800]   and she possibly may have bought into that rumor
[03:29:52.800 --> 03:29:57.800]   because my cover for when I went to the United States
[03:29:57.800 --> 03:30:01.860]   was that I changed careers again,
[03:30:01.860 --> 03:30:06.760]   and I joined an institution in Kazakhstan
[03:30:06.760 --> 03:30:09.000]   that did space research.
[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:12.760]   Intercosmos something something,
[03:30:12.760 --> 03:30:17.760]   and I had a piece of paper that invited me to start there,
[03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:20.840]   and it was a forgery.
[03:30:20.840 --> 03:30:22.880]   Intercosmos never existed,
[03:30:22.880 --> 03:30:25.340]   but people knew that in Kazakhstan
[03:30:25.340 --> 03:30:29.380]   there were super secret facilities.
[03:30:30.520 --> 03:30:33.700]   And one of my classmates,
[03:30:33.700 --> 03:30:35.020]   old classmates from high school,
[03:30:35.020 --> 03:30:40.020]   started the rumor that I died in a rocket accident,
[03:30:40.020 --> 03:30:41.960]   and everybody knew that.
[03:30:41.960 --> 03:30:45.340]   So when I came back to Germany,
[03:30:45.340 --> 03:30:47.420]   went back to Germany,
[03:30:47.420 --> 03:30:51.420]   I found the telephone number of this girl
[03:30:51.420 --> 03:30:53.460]   that had dumped me.
[03:30:53.460 --> 03:30:57.500]   I called her, and I said to her,
[03:30:57.500 --> 03:30:59.300]   "So guess who this is.
[03:30:59.300 --> 03:31:01.440]   "Maybe you hold on to your chair."
[03:31:01.440 --> 03:31:02.360]   She says, "Yes."
[03:31:02.360 --> 03:31:04.940]   I said, "This is Albrecht."
[03:31:04.940 --> 03:31:08.440]   (Albrecht screaming)
[03:31:08.440 --> 03:31:09.800]   - It's a good payback.
[03:31:09.800 --> 03:31:10.800]   (both laughing)
[03:31:10.800 --> 03:31:12.360]   - No, we actually met.
[03:31:12.360 --> 03:31:15.000]   So there's two elderly people in their 60s
[03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:19.700]   who meet each other after so many years,
[03:31:19.700 --> 03:31:24.480]   and the one that ended the relationship
[03:31:24.480 --> 03:31:26.840]   started the conversation by saying,
[03:31:26.840 --> 03:31:31.180]   "You know what, I made a really bad mistake."
[03:31:31.180 --> 03:31:33.820]   And the tears came down her cheeks.
[03:31:33.820 --> 03:31:35.260]   I wasn't asking for that.
[03:31:35.260 --> 03:31:38.380]   I wasn't happy about it, but it did feel good.
[03:31:38.380 --> 03:31:41.820]   Now, a while later,
[03:31:41.820 --> 03:31:46.380]   I knew why she said she made a mistake.
[03:31:46.380 --> 03:31:47.540]   I met her husband.
[03:31:47.540 --> 03:31:52.740]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a,
[03:31:52.740 --> 03:31:55.100]   Tom Waits has a song called "Martha,"
[03:31:55.100 --> 03:31:59.020]   where he made, or an older gentleman calls
[03:31:59.020 --> 03:32:01.360]   somebody he used to love, and they have a conversation.
[03:32:01.360 --> 03:32:03.240]   They're both married now,
[03:32:03.240 --> 03:32:06.720]   and it's, sometimes you can meet people from your past,
[03:32:06.720 --> 03:32:08.320]   and it gives you a glimpse
[03:32:08.320 --> 03:32:10.560]   of a possible different life you could have had.
[03:32:10.560 --> 03:32:13.080]   - Oh, yeah, and you know, I was actually,
[03:32:13.080 --> 03:32:14.520]   when she said, "I made a mistake,"
[03:32:14.520 --> 03:32:16.860]   and I was thinking to myself,
[03:32:16.860 --> 03:32:19.560]   "No, you didn't."
[03:32:19.560 --> 03:32:20.400]   There was none.
[03:32:20.400 --> 03:32:21.220]   There was nothing left.
[03:32:21.220 --> 03:32:24.040]   There was nothing left.
[03:32:24.040 --> 03:32:25.920]   And also, the person that she became,
[03:32:25.920 --> 03:32:33.440]   personality-wise, wasn't as attractive as I remembered her.
[03:32:33.440 --> 03:32:35.760]   You know, it's puppy love, you know?
[03:32:35.760 --> 03:32:37.040]   - But it's still love.
[03:32:37.040 --> 03:32:37.880]   - Yeah, oh, it was.
[03:32:37.880 --> 03:32:38.720]   - It still happened.
[03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:40.720]   - It was passionate love, for sure,
[03:32:40.720 --> 03:32:45.680]   and I would have thrown myself under the bus
[03:32:45.680 --> 03:32:47.240]   if I could save her.
[03:32:47.240 --> 03:32:49.100]   It was that strong, and just as strong
[03:32:49.100 --> 03:32:50.960]   as the love for my two girls.
[03:32:51.400 --> 03:32:52.240]   - Yeah.
[03:32:52.240 --> 03:32:58.000]   Life is full of moments and periods like that of love,
[03:32:58.000 --> 03:33:01.440]   and that's what makes life so fricking awesome.
[03:33:01.440 --> 03:33:03.720]   But it does come to an end.
[03:33:03.720 --> 03:33:06.060]   - And so does this conversation, I guess.
[03:33:06.060 --> 03:33:10.400]   - This goes on for many more hours, but yes.
[03:33:10.400 --> 03:33:12.040]   Do you think about your own death?
[03:33:12.040 --> 03:33:12.880]   - Huh?
[03:33:12.880 --> 03:33:13.700]   - Do you think about death?
[03:33:13.700 --> 03:33:14.880]   Do you think about your own death?
[03:33:14.880 --> 03:33:16.120]   - Yes.
[03:33:16.120 --> 03:33:17.440]   - Are you afraid of it?
[03:33:17.440 --> 03:33:19.920]   - Yes, even though I'm a Christian.
[03:33:20.760 --> 03:33:23.800]   (Ralph sighs)
[03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:26.720]   - As a Christian, do you have a sense of what's coming after?
[03:33:26.720 --> 03:33:28.360]   Or is it full of uncertainty?
[03:33:28.360 --> 03:33:29.320]   - I have a hope.
[03:33:29.320 --> 03:33:31.240]   I have a hope.
[03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:37.000]   You know, there's a lot of Christianity
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:39.400]   which is quite logical.
[03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:42.280]   A lot of Christianity which is also, you know,
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:45.100]   the life of Christ has a lot of proof.
[03:33:46.520 --> 03:33:51.520]   But, you know, I became a Christian
[03:33:51.520 --> 03:33:56.960]   starting with a head.
[03:33:56.960 --> 03:34:01.960]   And I was already quite old.
[03:34:01.960 --> 03:34:06.960]   And I, you know, when you don't get this faith very early,
[03:34:14.560 --> 03:34:16.880]   it's tougher to buy into everything.
[03:34:16.880 --> 03:34:20.880]   You know, there are some things that are difficult
[03:34:20.880 --> 03:34:23.760]   for me to understand and believe,
[03:34:23.760 --> 03:34:26.160]   but there's many, many other things
[03:34:26.160 --> 03:34:29.560]   that I can't explain only with the existence of a God.
[03:34:29.560 --> 03:34:34.560]   But whether he lets us go again in eternity, I just hope.
[03:34:34.560 --> 03:34:39.840]   I won't convince somebody else at this point,
[03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:43.360]   which doesn't make me a really, really good Christian
[03:34:43.360 --> 03:34:45.260]   because I'm supposed to evangelize.
[03:34:45.260 --> 03:34:48.640]   - But there's still a fear.
[03:34:48.640 --> 03:34:49.480]   - Yeah.
[03:34:49.480 --> 03:34:50.920]   - There's a fear and a hope.
[03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:53.760]   - On the other hand, I know that,
[03:34:53.760 --> 03:34:58.760]   you see, this is how I approach the last years of my life.
[03:34:58.760 --> 03:35:06.040]   I will not mentally or physically get decrepit.
[03:35:08.560 --> 03:35:13.560]   I will do everything I can do to be alert and fit.
[03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:16.200]   I still run.
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:18.760]   I run four or five times a week.
[03:35:18.760 --> 03:35:21.880]   And I'm going to start lifting weights again.
[03:35:21.880 --> 03:35:22.880]   - Good.
[03:35:22.880 --> 03:35:24.880]   So you stay physically and mentally sharp.
[03:35:24.880 --> 03:35:26.240]   - Yes.
[03:35:26.240 --> 03:35:27.760]   - Go out with guns blazing.
[03:35:27.760 --> 03:35:30.000]   - That's, and I once read a book
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:32.640]   written by a medical doctor.
[03:35:32.640 --> 03:35:34.100]   He said most people,
[03:35:35.960 --> 03:35:39.080]   when they're becoming mature,
[03:35:39.080 --> 03:35:43.280]   the rest of their life is a slow downward move.
[03:35:43.280 --> 03:35:46.480]   And--
[03:35:46.480 --> 03:35:47.680]   - Not for you.
[03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:51.480]   - No, the last years are pretty bad.
[03:35:51.480 --> 03:35:53.920]   He said, "You gotta do this."
[03:35:53.920 --> 03:35:54.760]   Boom.
[03:35:54.760 --> 03:35:57.920]   - That's pretty good advice from a doctor.
[03:35:57.920 --> 03:36:02.440]   And if nothing else from Christianity,
[03:36:02.440 --> 03:36:04.440]   whichever parts you take on,
[03:36:04.440 --> 03:36:06.520]   one of the big ones is love.
[03:36:06.520 --> 03:36:07.360]   - Yes.
[03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:09.280]   - That's something you've lived from the very beginning
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:12.880]   before God was part of your life,
[03:36:12.880 --> 03:36:14.240]   before anything was part of your life,
[03:36:14.240 --> 03:36:16.440]   it seemed that love was part of your life
[03:36:16.440 --> 03:36:18.480]   and has been a consistent thread throughout.
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:19.320]   - Yes, sir.
[03:36:19.320 --> 03:36:24.320]   And there's a short sentence in the Bible
[03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:25.760]   that says God is love.
[03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:28.880]   And the other thing I wanna say,
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:31.720]   the Christian morality is,
[03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:35.240]   I can sign that with my blood.
[03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:38.880]   - God is love, amen.
[03:36:38.880 --> 03:36:41.440]   Jack, you're an incredible person,
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:43.180]   lived an incredible life.
[03:36:43.180 --> 03:36:46.120]   Thank you for talking today.
[03:36:46.120 --> 03:36:47.760]   Thank you for telling your story.
[03:36:47.760 --> 03:36:50.320]   Thank you for being who you are.
[03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:53.640]   And thank you for being all about love.
[03:36:53.640 --> 03:36:56.080]   This is a beautiful conversation, it was an honor.
[03:36:56.080 --> 03:36:56.920]   Thank you for talking today.
[03:36:56.920 --> 03:36:59.800]   - Yeah, and appreciate the tough questions that you asked.
[03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:02.200]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:03.400]   with Jack Barsky.

[03:37:09.160 --> 03:37:10.460]   from Edward Snowden.
[03:37:10.460 --> 03:37:12.600]   You can't come up against
[03:37:12.600 --> 03:37:15.080]   the world's most powerful intelligence agencies
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:17.200]   and not accept the risk.
[03:37:17.200 --> 03:37:21.000]   If they want to get you, over time, they will.
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:25.160]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:27.740]   (upbeat music)
[03:37:27.740 --> 03:37:30.320]   (upbeat music)
