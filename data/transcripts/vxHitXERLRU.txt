[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.440]   We're back with hip hop artist and our good friend,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.280]   Trip Lee.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.740]   Trip, you recently tweeted this, quote,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.740]   "Insecurity only exists when we try to find security in self.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.080]   "Finding hope in a God who never disappoints
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.600]   "can only make you feel more secure," end quote.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.320]   So explain that.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320]   How does our mistaken self-sufficiency
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.120]   feed our personal insecurities?
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.280]   Well, I tweeted that that particular morning
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.760]   because that's what I was feeling in my heart.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.000]   You know, I was feeling somewhat insecure.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.340]   I don't, to be honest, I don't even remember
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.080]   what it was about, but it became really clear to me
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.840]   very quickly that it was because I was looking to myself.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.640]   You know, I wasn't good enough or strong enough
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.320]   to make things happen the way I wanted them to.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.200]   You know, I can think of many times that I feel like that.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.040]   And I needed the reminder in that moment
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.480]   that my security shouldn't be in my goodness
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.000]   or my strength anyway.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.280]   You know, so I am gonna look at myself sometimes
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.640]   and think, you know what, I'm not strong enough,
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.840]   or I'm not good enough, or, you know,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520]   I'm not great enough in my job,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.040]   or I'm not the best rapper of all time,
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.880]   or I'm not as good as an author as John Piper,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.380]   or I'm not this or that.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.040]   But if I look to those things for my security,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.800]   then I'm setting myself up to be insecure every day
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.340]   for the rest of my life.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.520]   So, you know, of course I'd feel unsafe
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.440]   if I was on a flight and my safety depended
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.120]   on my knowledge of how to fly a plane.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.400]   Of course I would feel unsafe.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.880]   I don't know anything about flying a plane.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.380]   I don't have the power to do that.
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.040]   But I'm not the pilot, you know?
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.840]   So I can feel safe when I'm in a plane
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.240]   because it's in the pilot's hand and he's trained.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.740]   And so when I think about my life, you know what,
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.440]   I'm not sovereign, I'm not all-knowing.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.640]   The Lord hasn't perfected me yet, but God is.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.920]   Christ is.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.960]   And that's where I'm finding my security.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.800]   So the more and more I look to this God,
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.960]   so when I look at myself, I'm gonna disappoint.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.160]   You know, I'm gonna fall short sometimes.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   You know, I'm gonna even go back on things that I said
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.660]   and I'm gonna have room for lots of growth.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.560]   And so when I try to find hope there,
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.040]   I'll be constantly disappointed.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.720]   But if I look to God and I try to find hope in him,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.200]   well, I'm never gonna be disappointed
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.000]   'cause every day I'm gonna wake up
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.160]   and there ain't gonna be no mercies waiting for me.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.960]   And every day when I pray,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.520]   I'm gonna know I have this advocate in Christ
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.920]   that intercedes between me and God.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.240]   And I'm gonna know that in my future,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.400]   God's gonna wipe away every tear from my eyes.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   And I'm gonna read scripture
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.520]   and I'm gonna see him being faithful to his people
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.200]   over and over again, going before his people
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.840]   and battling and sending Jesus
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.600]   and just goodness and strength and sovereignty on display.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.120]   And the more I look to that God,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.400]   the more I'm gonna feel more and more secure.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.160]   The more I'm gonna feel more safe.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   So God is sovereign and all-knowing and strong.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.920]   And that's where real hope and peace is gonna come from
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.320]   that really can't be moved because God can't be moved.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.160]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.000]   And what I find interesting is that when you woke up,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.520]   you felt the insecurity and you had the instinct to know
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.280]   that it was a mistaken understanding of the goodness of God.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.680]   - Absolutely, because I know when I feel that way,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.000]   that's kind of my heart rising up.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.480]   And that's why I need to go to scripture every single day.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.720]   I'm gonna wake up feeling like that so often
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.320]   and I desperately, desperately need scripture
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.160]   to correct me in that every day.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.200]   - Amen, that's well said.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.040]   Thank you, Tripp.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.560]   And tomorrow I wanna talk about your new book, "Rise,"
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.520]   and especially what you say about procrastination,
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   which no surprise, you have some mature thoughts
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.960]   to share on this topic as well.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.600]   Tripp Lee's latest album and his new book
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.480]   are both titled "Rise," and you can find them now
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.200]   at amazon.com.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.320]   Thanks for listening.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.520]   (upbeat music)
