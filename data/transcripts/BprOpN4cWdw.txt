[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Well, with Christ's love for the church providing the typological pattern or the archetype for
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.940]   a man's love of his wife, it's no surprise that we get a lot of emails from husbands
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.140]   who don't know if they're on the right track here.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.360]   What does Christ-like love look like in the life of a husband's daily life?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   It's the question today from a listener named Zachary.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.560]   "Pastor John, this winter I will be married and I have little to no experience with men
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.660]   in my life leading their wives well.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.760]   What are some general parameters for me and for all new husbands to know whether we are
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.760]   leading our brides in a way that honors and reflects Christ's love of the church?"
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.360]   Okay, Zachary, here it is in a nutshell.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:58.000]   Make Ephesians 5, 25 to 33 your lifelong charter of how to love your wife and what it means
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   to live in the covenant relationship which God designed in order to show the world the
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.080]   beauty of his own covenant love for the church.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.880]   Make it your lifelong charter.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.660]   It is an inexhaustible passage.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.560]   It will break you down and then build you back up again and again as you discover more
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.240]   and more deeply the wonders of the mystery of marriage.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.060]   Very few people in our day, even in the church, think of marriage as deeply and seriously
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.480]   and gloriously as God intends.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.740]   We have by and large, it seems to me, absorbed the world's superficial views about marriage
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.080]   and its glories and we've utterly neglected what it is really about.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.300]   And then add 1 Peter 3, 7, one verse, to this lifelong charter.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.680]   So now you've got two pieces to the charter.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:18.880]   Ephesians 5, 25 to 33 and 1 Peter 3, 7, where you have this phrase, "Fellow heirs of the
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.080]   grace of life."
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   You will never get to the bottom of that phrase, ever.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.080]   Not in this life, probably not in the next.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.860]   Fellow heirs of the grace of life.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.480]   Two people, a man and a woman, both of whom are utterly and totally sinful and therefore
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.280]   utterly and totally dependent on grace for this life and the next.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.200]   What would that look like?
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.520]   What a glorious thing that would look like of two brokenhearted, saved, grace-dependent
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.160]   people living together.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.620]   But now let me get specific, just a few specific questions because I'm sure that's what you
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.440]   want me to do.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.740]   Ephesians 5, 25 to 33 is designed as the redemption of what was destroyed in Genesis 3.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.740]   Let's start there.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.800]   Just realize that connection.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.600]   When Adam and Eve fell from the beautiful plan that God had for them, Ephesians 5, 25
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.280]   to 33 is the rebuilding of what was destroyed.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.240]   Now let's read what was destroyed.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   You'll see it.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.240]   You can see at least three terrible destructions.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.520]   Then the eyes of both were opened.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.260]   So Adam and Eve, they'd just eaten of the forbidden fruit.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.480]   Then the eyes of both were opened and they saw, they knew that they were naked.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.380]   And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.320]   And they heard the sound of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.520]   And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.760]   of the garden.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.300]   But the Lord God called to the man, to the man, step up Adam.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.680]   He called to the man and said to him, where are you?
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.200]   And he said, I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.520]   and I hid myself.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.280]   And God said, who told you you were naked?
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.920]   Have you eaten of the tree, which I commanded you not to eat?
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.800]   The man said, the woman, you gave to me.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.040]   She gave me the fruit and I ate.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.580]   Good night.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.720]   Notice three catastrophic corruptions to this beautiful relationship.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.200]   Number one, the man and the woman felt shame for their nakedness.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.840]   They weren't safe with each other anymore.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.440]   We've all tasted this, right?
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:59.160]   He or she may see me in my most vulnerable condition, naked, and they may say something
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.440]   utterly devastating about me that would wound this relationship for the rest of our lives.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.400]   Number two, they hid themselves not just for each other, but from the Lord.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   They were afraid.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.200]   I was afraid because I was naked.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.800]   So the relationship horizontally and vertically was ruined.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.000]   And what a universe of misery entered the world.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.040]   Number three, the man's first reaction to this new ruined set of relationships is blame
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.520]   her and blame God who gave her to me.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.560]   The woman you gave me, she gave me the fruit.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.400]   So there's the tragic result that Ephesians 5 is intended to heal.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.960]   Shame, fear, blame, guilt shifting.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.800]   And what you know, Zachary, you know this as a Christian, Jesus Christ came into the
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.480]   world to save people from all that relational destruction.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.040]   That's why he came.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.320]   And his central, all-important way of saving us from shame and fear and blame and guilt
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.760]   shifting is to die, to die in our place and on our behalf.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.920]   Rise from the dead, give us eternal hope.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.240]   In other words, Jesus deals with our sin in such a way that fear and shame and blame and
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.800]   guilt shifting are destroyed in his redeemed family.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.440]   And he does it by dying, dying.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.000]   Now what this means for you as a husband who is called to be the head of your marriage
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.040]   and your family, Ephesians 5.23, you are the head, and to love your wife as Christ loved
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.920]   the church, Ephesians 5.25.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.680]   What this means is that you now take the lead.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:09.280]   That is, you feel a special responsibility to take initiatives for creating an atmosphere
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.760]   and putting in place the means of grace that replace shame with honor, 1 Peter 3.7 says,
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:23.360]   and fear with joyful confidence and blame or guilt shifting with forbearance and forgiveness.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.400]   You feel a special responsibility for putting in place an atmosphere and means of grace
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.240]   that accomplish those glorious ends.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:40.640]   In other words, you yourself first receive the redeeming work of Christ in your own brokenness
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.640]   and sinfulness.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.560]   And then you bend it, you bend it outward after the model of Christ to show it to your
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.480]   wife and your children.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:08:00.120]   But notice carefully, get this, tune in, you and your wife are fellow heirs of grace, 1
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:09.140]   Peter 3.7, which means that she is experiencing from the Lord Jesus directly by faith, not
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.420]   through you, the same redemption.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:20.840]   And she too has a responsibility to bend it outwardly and horizontally toward you and
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.480]   the children.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:32.520]   That's why I said as a head, as a leader, you have a special responsibility as the head
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:42.960]   to take initiatives for creating and sustaining a spiritual and emotional and physical atmosphere
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:51.320]   where your wife feels protected and safe, safe from verbal put downs and other wounding
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:59.520]   that might come from you or the children and where she feels provided for and where she
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.760]   feels that she doesn't have to push because you're already moving in the direction of
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.120]   establishing a gracious and godly atmosphere in the home.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:20.000]   So Zachary, here's one little guideline, one little practical test to see if you are fulfilling
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.680]   your calling in this regard when you get there.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:31.440]   Pose this question, who in this family is saying, me or my wife, who in this family
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:42.360]   is saying let's most often in regard to establishing a healthy family pattern of life, prayer patterns,
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.760]   Bible reading patterns, church attendance patterns, patterns of moral guidance for the
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.400]   children, patterns of pace and schedule, patterns of how you handle the iPhones, patterns of
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.320]   financial responsibility in living within the budget and on and on.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:06.720]   The husband as head should not leave a wife in a position where she feels like these things
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:17.440]   are being neglected and she must push on you in order to initiate the necessary conversations.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:25.480]   Spiritual leadership from a husband who is a saved sinner, dependent on daily grace,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:32.480]   readily confessing his own sins and flaws to her, to the kids, to his friends, such
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:39.960]   spiritual leadership does not mean one-sided decision making.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.000]   It means saying let's.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.640]   Let's talk about the budget, honey.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.360]   Let's talk about the way we discipline our kids.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.620]   Let's talk about the most helpful pattern of prayer and Bible reading for both of us.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.320]   Let's talk about church and participation there.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.120]   Let's talk about the moral vision we want to have for a family in this community.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:07.520]   The reason you lead with let's instead of unilateral commands is because you're not
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.800]   Christ.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.640]   You are only as Christ.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.120]   Can you make that distinction?
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:23.320]   That as, lead her, love her as Christ loved the church, that as means you take into full
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:31.560]   account your own sinfulness and finitude and how a sinful finite leader creates the fullest
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.080]   joy and fruitfulness in the family.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.920]   And you may find, you will find, I dare say, you may find in any of these cases that your
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.700]   wife has greater wisdom than you do, which is just fine.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.820]   That doesn't mean she suddenly becomes the leader.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:55.740]   She will be thrilled that in your initiative taking leadership, you are humble enough to
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.440]   receive a wise word when you hear it.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:05.360]   No worthy leader, president of the United States, general of an army, no worthy leader
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.000]   assumes he has all the wisdom he needs.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.080]   So Zachary, there is so much more and the Lord will show it to you if you make Ephesians
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:24.760]   five and first Peter three the lifelong charter for your calling as a husband.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.720]   And on behalf of all men who married smarter women, amen, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.880]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast a part of your day and commute.

[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   If you want to ask about sort of the theological underpinnings that drive everything that we
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.080]   talk about, we love questions like that.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.560]   Marriage questions as well.

[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.280]   Well Wednesday we're going to talk about preaching.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.720]   Specifically we're going to look at six subtle ways that preachers unwittingly undermine
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.280]   the authority of scripture in front of their congregations.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.520]   You will not want to miss this one.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.280]   I think it's going to be relevant for preachers and aspiring preachers and to congregants
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   as well.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.160]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and we'll see you then and have a wonderful Reformation 500
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.880]   celebration on Tuesday.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.200]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
