[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.340]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.360]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets, and
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.640]   I'm your host. And today, we continue with a myth-busting show, "Why Your 401(k) Won't
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.840]   Make You Rich."
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.880]   Information for today's show comes in via a comment that was recently posted just this
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.840]   week here in our Radical Personal Finance community Facebook group. A listener writes
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.160]   in and said this, "Joshua has expressed repeatedly that people don't get rich using 401(k)s,
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.080]   and I just heard another podcaster express similar sentiment. Am I missing something?
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.480]   I do really well working as an employee and have zero interest in running my own business
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.440]   except possibly adding real estate to my portfolio. I've been investing 100% in stocks since
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.000]   I graduated from college, and I'm happy with my personal rate of return. I understand
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.200]   that most people don't get rich with 401(k)s, but to me, it appears the problem is not with
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.880]   401(k) or the process, but the fact that people are not saving enough money and/or choosing
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.520]   bad investments. What am I missing?"
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.160]   Various community members piped in with good contributions, but I thought this was a valuable
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.560]   topic for today's show. There are many things that I like about the structure of a 401(k)
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.080]   plan and there are many things that I don't like about the structure of a 401(k) plan.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.240]   I thought about doing today's show 21 Things I Hate About 401(k)s. But if I do that, it'll
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.460]   take away from the central objection that I have to looking at a 401(k) as a primary
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:26.760]   engine of wealth building. The objection is this. It's not that you can't get rich using
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:39.880]   a 401(k). It's that the 401(k) is not causing you to get rich. You can put about $18,000
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.420]   into a 401(k) and defer that in as far as your personal deferment right now under the
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.780]   current tax law numbers. You can put more than that in if you're over 50 and your employer
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.700]   might put additional contributions and matches in and you could set up additional ways to
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.460]   get more money into it as well. Some accounts could be designed to be able to get as much
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:12.500]   of it as about $50,000 per year into the account. Obviously, if you invest $18,000 per year
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.940]   into an account and you do that over the course of 40 years and you earn say 8% interest rate
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.180]   and you start with nothing, over the course of 40 years, you can get rich using a 401(k).
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.300]   The calculation on that would come out to be about $5,036,000 if you were to contribute
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.980]   that $18,000 level over the course of 40 years. It's not that you can't get rich using a
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.040]   401(k). It's that the 401(k) is not what's making you rich. Here, I want to just focus
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:58.200]   today on the question of causation versus correlation. It's my opinion that 401(k) and
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.040]   wealth that's built in 401(k) is correlated to people who are rich but there's not a causative
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.000]   relationship. Let me expand. The question of causation versus correlation is one of
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.760]   the most significant logical fallacies and areas of research that we all need to continually
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.920]   keep in mind. I never find that I can let my guard down because I often look at a factor
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:28.640]   and I'll think that this factor A is causing effect B and then something else will happen.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.360]   I'll come along and say, "Wait a second. Is there something else going on?" This happens
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:42.200]   in a lot of areas in our own life, a lot of areas of policy, of – just everywhere throughout
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.280]   society. Let's start with an example just to make this very, very clear. It's been
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.800]   measured and observed that as ice cream sales increase, the rate of drowning deaths increase
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.660]   sharply as well. This is my favorite example because it's true and it's measurable.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.860]   As ice cream sales increase, the rate of drowning deaths increase sharply as well. So the obvious
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.840]   conclusion is that ice cream consumption causes drowning. After all, isn't that why your
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.680]   mother and your grandmother said, "No, you can't go swimming right after you eat lunch.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.640]   You have to wait a while for the food to settle," because ice cream consumption causes drowning.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:31.400]   Is that the right conclusion? That example should immediately spark it. You're thinking,
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.240]   "Well, no. That's not the right conclusion. I can't see how ice cream causes drowning.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.240]   Could there not be another factor going on here?"
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:49.560]   So the simple obvious factor between these is that you have to look at the time of year.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.620]   What's the calendar time of year and what is the effect of the temperature on ice cream
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.780]   sales and also what's the effect of temperature on the number of people that are swimming?
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.640]   More ice cream is sold during the hot summer months than during colder times of year. It's
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.680]   also during the hot summer months that people are more likely to be engaged in activities
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.020]   around the water such as swimming. Because more people are going to be engaged in activities
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.040]   around the water, there's a good chance that more of them will drown because of their time
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.240]   in the water. So that would be the more fundamental relationship.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.480]   Now even that, you could say that there's not necessarily a causative relationship.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.260]   It's not that summer causes drowning deaths. But the fundamental factor that's influencing
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:47.580]   both of these things is the time of year, not the fact of eating ice cream. If you grasp
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.000]   that concept and you start looking into areas in your life and you start looking at areas
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.320]   in society, you find yourself questioning a lot of commonly accepted wisdom.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.420]   I've done many shows on education, the common – the idea of government education, how
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.080]   to improve schooling, things like that. This is a common debate. I've never seen any
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.560]   evidence for example that spending more money on schooling improves the outcome and the
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:21.880]   results. The consistent theme that people claim is that if we spend more money on schooling,
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   we tax citizens higher, spend more money on schooling, then we spend more money and we
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   do that, then we'll be able to improve the outcome and the results.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   But I've never seen any evidence of that. It might exist. I'm not an education specialist.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.640]   I've just never seen any evidence of that. I've seen lots of evidence that seemingly
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.180]   the fundamental factor or at least one of perhaps two or three fundamental factors that
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:50.480]   improves educational outcomes is parental involvement. The more involved that you can
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.440]   get a parent in a child's education and their schooling process, the better the outcome.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.840]   That doesn't cost money.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.280]   And so that's just a politically charged example to demonstrate that this exists throughout
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:12.920]   society. We all have areas in our lives that we're confusing the factors involved and
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.560]   we all should be – try to seek to be aware of them and search those things out.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   So to state the matter clearly and then expand and try to give some more proof for my case,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:34.840]   it's my claim that high 401(k) account balances aren't causing people to be wealthy.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:41.660]   It's my claim that high 401(k) balances are correlated with people who are doing other
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.040]   things to become wealthy.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:53.520]   Let's talk through this by using the format of the factors needed to build wealth. If
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.920]   we're going to do a calculation using a financial calculator, there are a total of
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:05.440]   five possible numbers that we can use and we can only solve for one of them at a time.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.320]   In this case, the number that we're going to solve for is going to be the FV function
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.280]   on a financial calculator, the future value. And the goal is how do we get a high future
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.720]   value. If we're starting off, we're in the beginning or middle of our careers and
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.440]   we're looking forward to retirement age and we say, "I want to have a lot of money
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.120]   in an account, high future value. How do I get there?"
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:32.800]   Well, there are four factors that will contribute to my reaching that high future value. Those
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:41.400]   four factors are N, the number of payments, specifically how long am I investing. Am I
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:48.920]   investing for five years, 25 years, or 50 years? I is the rate of interest. What is
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.880]   the actual realized rate of interest that I receive on my investments? For this, we
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.240]   have to take the gross interest rate, the gross gain on the portfolio and pull off our
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:08.800]   taxes and our fees. PV is our present value. That's what we start at. Do we start with
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.000]   a lot of money or a little money? And then payment is how much money do we put into the
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.400]   account every month or every year.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:25.280]   With those four factors, we can calculate what our future value is going to be. You
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.480]   want your number of payments to be as long as possible, all things being equal. The longer
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:37.120]   you can invest, the more money that you'll have at the end of your investment time period.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.760]   Whenever possible, you want that I, the interest rate, to be as high as possible. All else
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.480]   being equal, the higher the interest rate, the more money we'll have at the end of our
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.900]   investment term. We want that number of that payment to be as high as possible. All else
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:58.280]   being equal, the more money we can save into the account every month or every year, the
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.360]   more money we'll have at the end of the investment period.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.160]   And finally, we want to start with as high of a beginning value as possible because all
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.360]   else being equal, the larger our portfolio is at the beginning of our investment term,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:19.240]   the higher our future wealth will be. The only one of those variables that the idea
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:31.400]   of a 401(k) account directly impacts is possibly the interest rate because it possibly helps
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:39.480]   us to defer some taxation, which helps the money to grow more consistently and at a lower
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.960]   cost over time. That's the primary factor. If you have an employer match, it might affect
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.480]   your payment as well. So I guess I shouldn't say the only. Forgive me. If you have an employer
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.840]   match, it might affect your payment as well.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:12:00.240]   But these are not the biggest factors in building wealth. Rather, in my experience and opinion,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.520]   the biggest factors are going to be how big is the payment that's going into the account.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.520]   That's going to be driven by your level of income and your level of expenses and how
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.960]   much money you can save and the length of time that you can contribute. Those are going
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.920]   to be bigger factors for most people than the amount of interest and a small employer
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:33.960]   match. Access to and participation in 401(k) plans is correlated to people who have a higher
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.840]   income and who can invest for a longer period of time than people who don't have access
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.160]   to 401(k)s.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:50.480]   Let me draw this out by sake of an example. I want to stereotype here and use two stereotypes
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:58.320]   to illustrate the differences between possible career paths and their influence on 401(k)
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.520]   accounts. Stereotyping is always dangerous because it means that you're looking at populations
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.960]   rather than individuals. And I don't like that because I like to recognize that any
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.440]   individual can change and grow and improve. But I think here it's valuable. Let's compare
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:22.280]   the career trajectory between a lower class blue collar worker working in the trades versus
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:30.000]   an upper class college educated white collar worker who's starting off in a large corporation
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.040]   working in a corporate job. Here I'm thinking of a few friends of mine who would fit these
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.520]   stereotypes on either end very, very well.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:44.760]   For our lower class blue collar worker, we're going to use the trade of working as an electrician.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.840]   The skill of working as an electrician is a very valuable skill. And when an electrician
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:56.280]   advances in their career up through journeyman and master electrician level, they can earn
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:03.400]   an excellent wage. But the career trajectory starts with an entry level job. It starts
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.320]   with – it's not minimum wage. Construction employers can't get workers at minimum wage.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.480]   But it starts at say in today's world, $10 to $11 an hour and it will go up from there.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:22.160]   White collar worker goes to college. Let's say a son of college educated parents, dual
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.920]   income college educated parents, parents stress education, goes to a middle to upper level
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.480]   college, works his way through the college sorting mechanism and comes out the other
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:38.320]   side and gets a job working as an entry level or mid-level white collar worker, perhaps
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.280]   an analyst, something like that.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:47.920]   Let's talk through some of these factors. First factor, starting value of the portfolio,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:55.080]   the present value of the portfolio. In this case, I want to hold both of these at zero.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:01.200]   Both of our workers, neither of our workers start with any money. They both start with
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:08.120]   zero. However, if you think of people that you may know, somebody who's just starting
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:14.140]   off in their career as a – coming out of a lower class and going into a blue collar
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:20.620]   profession, are they likely to have more of a starting point than somebody who's upper
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.720]   class and going into a white collar profession?
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.520]   In my experience, the upper class person may have something like their parents have given
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.760]   them a car or helped them to buy a car, whereas the lower class blue collar worker may have
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:42.840]   needed to start by saving up money for a car. Just the fact of – here we're going to
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   say the upper class person has a college education, college degree. That's a tremendous asset
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:53.800]   that many times an upper class person's parents have paid for, for them. Whereas a
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   lower class blue collar worker, if they've gotten a college degree or getting a college
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.560]   degree or pursuing something like trade school, they're going to be doing that – paying
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.760]   for that themselves oftentimes.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:09.240]   So even if we start with an account value at zero, there's a good chance that an upper
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:16.680]   class white collar worker will start with more money as reflected in parents gave them
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.840]   a car, parents helped with a college degree, parents are helping with things to set up
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.600]   a household, independent household, buying furniture, helping with all of those basic
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:36.320]   expenses. That will have an impact on how much the upper class white collar worker can
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.280]   save for something like retirement.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.920]   So for both of these examples, we're going to hold their PV, their present value, their
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:51.640]   starting value of their account at zero. But even if we do that, our upper class white
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:59.520]   collar worker stereotype is going to start with a higher embedded advantage because of
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.800]   the other factors where their parents have helped them.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.640]   Why am I drawing a distinction here between a lower class blue collar worker and an upper
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:14.520]   class white collar entry level worker? Primarily, I'm drawing this distinction because the
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:21.000]   blue collar worker is not going to have access to a 401(k) and the white collar worker is.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:30.800]   Again, my argument here is that these things are correlated. Correlated. And so people
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:39.840]   who have access to 401(k)s are much more likely to be this upper class white collar worker.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:47.640]   My friend that I'm picturing in my head as my stereotype for the lower class electrician
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:54.440]   is one of the hardest working, most intelligent people that I know of and dedicated to his
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.280]   skill and to his craft. He started his career. He came out of high school, got a high school
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.000]   degree. College was not for him. But he started his career working in various trades, wandered
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.600]   around a little bit between a few different professions, tile, electrician, plumbing,
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.040]   etc. until he finally settled into a job working as an entry level electrician due to a family
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.240]   friend who gave him an opportunity.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.800]   Started off with no knowledge but applied himself very, very diligently to his trade.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.840]   But the structure of the companies that he was working for during the beginning of his
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:38.720]   career do not lend themselves to access to 401(k)s. A majority of workers in the United
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:47.320]   States of America do not work for large corporations with big 401(k) plans. They simply don't.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.920]   They work for small and medium-sized businesses that are more independent. Most of these businesses
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:59.240]   don't provide 401(k) plans nor should they. If I were consulting with an owner of a small
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.760]   electrician – electrical company with let's say, you know, three, four, five vans on the
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:10.800]   road, two workers in each van going around and doing electrical work, I would never recommend
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:17.160]   to that particular company that they offer a 401(k) for their employees.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:23.720]   The administrative fees on 401(k) plans are comparatively very high. The rate of participation
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:30.800]   in 401(k) plans for workers in this segment of society is very, very low. It makes it
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:39.080]   very difficult for the business owner to even participate himself because if he's running
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.400]   a crew with a bunch of electricians working in it, they're likely to just say, "I
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.960]   want the money," and his participation rate is going to be so low that the owner may not
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.160]   even be able to make his own contributions.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.640]   So you have an expensive plan with low participation and most of the employees don't seem to
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:02.840]   value contributing to the 401(k) plan. There are a few who do, but most don't. So 401(k)
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.440]   is usually not an appropriate setup for that type of company.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:13.840]   Now if we contrast that with a more corporate approach, even a company that has say 40 or
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.480]   50 employees, now all of a sudden a 401(k) can work and people who are working in that
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:27.440]   more white-collar corporate environment tend to prefer something like a 401(k) as part
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.640]   of their compensation package. They participate at higher rates and so it works better in
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.440]   that situation.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:40.960]   My friend who started off his career working as an electrician never had access to a 401(k)
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:46.460]   for the first 10 to 15 years of his career. He worked very diligently, worked his way
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:52.680]   up in the profession, learned his skills, went to school at night to learn electrical
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.880]   skills, worked a lot on the side. But all of his employers along the way were small
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:05.560]   employers that didn't even offer a 401(k) and his lifestyle, he was continually going
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.440]   from one company to the next to get a better offer.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:17.040]   His lifestyle was so busy, it didn't lend itself well to being able to save into a 401(k).
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.320]   It took my friend about 15 years of hard work, moving from company to company, building skills,
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.440]   studying, going to school at night, learning to become a master electrician, passing various
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:32.760]   tests before he was able to transition out of residential and commercial electrical work
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:38.680]   and move into a position at – with a job at a local power plant working for a local
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.400]   electric company where now he's working for a large corporation that offers a 401(k)
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   plan.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.120]   If I compare that with another friend of mine that I went to college with, she started her
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:55.520]   career working in marketing, got a basic marketing degree, basic business degree, started her
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.000]   career with a relatively entry-level job. But on day one of her career, had access to
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.960]   a 401(k).
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.120]   Because of her time spent in college and because of the type of job that she got, on day one
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:15.640]   of her career, she was in a situation where she could earn more money than my friend who
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:21.600]   was working as an electrician, especially if only measured in 40 hours a week.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.000]   And because of her parental support network, her expenses were lower and she was able to
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.280]   participate in her 401(k) from day one.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:37.300]   So simple access to a 401(k) is going to be correlated with people who earn higher incomes
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:42.600]   and who have higher potential for wage growth over time.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:48.140]   If you think about many white-collar jobs here, if I think about my friend, when she
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:53.240]   started her career, she didn't have a lot of income. She didn't have a lot of skill.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.140]   She had a basic college degree and not a lot of skill.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.420]   But as she's building her skills, she's becoming more valuable in the marketplace.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.700]   As she's learning and studying the practice of effective marketing, she's also working
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.860]   in a corporate environment with other people.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:14.040]   And these other people, her career has a higher growth trajectory than does the career of
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.520]   most blue-collar workers.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.760]   Most lower-class blue-collar workers are going to reach a point in their skill where they
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.760]   are replaceable.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.080]   If you work on a factory floor, the factory is going to train you with the basic skills.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:34.620]   And then once you top out, your income is going to stagnate because there's not – unless
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:41.480]   you transition to management skills or unless you transition to entrepreneurship, there's
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.520]   not a lot of room for your wage to go up.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.120]   If you start your career as an electrician, you begin your earning career with $10 or
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.240]   $20 an hour and then you go up from there with steady hourly wages as you increase your
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.380]   skills and capability.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:04.440]   If you don't make the switch to management, you're going to top out at about $30 an hour,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.960]   $60,000 per year.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:14.120]   But the challenge is many people who work best in careers like the trades are not people
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.000]   who are well-suited to management.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.160]   They're not people who are well-suited to entrepreneurship.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.080]   Contrast that with the lifestyle and approach of a white-collar worker.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:31.520]   It's a much easier transition for many white-collar workers to transition to skills of management
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.000]   or possibly entrepreneurship to where their incomes can continue to grow.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.640]   They don't top out early in their career once they reach the height of their technical
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.520]   skill.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.700]   Because of these fundamental characteristics of the careers, the white-collar upper-class
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:54.320]   worker has the ability to start saving earlier because they're starting with a higher beginning
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.880]   salary.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.360]   They have the ability to save more in the beginning because they've invested in education.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.040]   Their starting salary is starting stronger and their expenses are likely to be a little
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.840]   bit lower versus somebody who has been scraping along starting in the trades working on an
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   hourly basis.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.780]   So they can save more.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:25.220]   Huge factor, because the career income continues to grow significantly, they can save more
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.700]   during the middle and later part of their career.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:35.920]   If you compare my friend who started in marketing, relatively entry-level wages, she started
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.380]   at $35,000 per year.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:47.160]   But if you compare her earnings to an average electrician also at about 45 or 50 years old,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:53.340]   if she just continues to learn a little bit, to practice skills with other people, to practice
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.240]   some management, it's very likely that she could be in mid-level marketing management
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.180]   and marketing strategy for a large company.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:08.500]   Her income at 45 should be much higher than somebody who is a technical worker.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.460]   She doesn't have to be light years smarter.
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.500]   She doesn't have to be light years ahead.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.500]   She's just got to be a little bit ahead.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.540]   Just the fact that she's gone through the college sorting process demonstrates that
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:25.540]   her intellectual capacity and her cognitive ability is going to be well-suited to additional
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.380]   learning throughout her career.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:33.020]   That is not necessarily the case with somebody who starts their career working as a server
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:38.960]   at a local restaurant and continues working as a server or starts as a customer sales
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.460]   associate at a local retail store and continues working as a customer service associate at
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.460]   a local retail store.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.900]   Length of career makes a huge difference as well.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.860]   With somebody who works in a lower-class blue-collar profession, there is a shortness, a shortened
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.740]   career just simply due to the physical structure of the job.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:04.940]   Many workers – I want to say a majority, but I can't confirm majority.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:13.180]   Many, many blue-collar workers go home from their job every single day in pain, physically
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.060]   hurting from the work that they've done, whether it's because they're standing on
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:23.060]   a factory floor, standing in a restaurant, standing as a service associate, working in
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:29.060]   a physically demanding trade such as electrician, such as plumbing, etc., working in a physically
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:34.460]   demanding occupation such as law enforcement or something similar to that.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:39.100]   Many, many workers go home physically hurting every day.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.340]   And this takes a toll on your body over the course of a career.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:48.980]   A 55-year-old tradesman is reaching the end of his effective working career if he's
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:57.620]   still working in the physical trades, if he's still pulling wires, doing pipe.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.580]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:05.460]   But 30, 40, 50 years of use of your body is going to have an effect on your ability to
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.100]   be as productive.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:14.660]   And if that person has not managed to transition to a management circle or to a business ownership
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:20.460]   circle, they're going to have a difficult time having a long career in the trades.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.980]   Contrast that to a white-collar worker.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.620]   A white-collar worker who's reaching 55 years old is at the height of their career
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:34.460]   and could very reasonably and easily continue it for another 15, 20, 25 years if their company
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:40.020]   will permit it without any abatement in productivity because their productivity and their career
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.660]   is not tied to their physical capacity.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:49.820]   It's tied to their mental capacity, their cognitive ability, the specific skills of
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.700]   their career.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.380]   So they can work longer, which means they can continue contributing to the 401(k) for
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.300]   longer.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:06.020]   When you start factoring together these different factors, starting earlier, making more money,
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:12.420]   working longer, all of these things lead to a higher lifetime earnings for the white-collar
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:21.140]   worker who fundamentally is likely to have access to a 401(k) as compared to a lower-class
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:28.180]   blue-collar worker who is less likely to even have access to a 401(k).
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:36.260]   The amount of your income is going to be one of the biggest drivers.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:42.900]   The amount of your income I believe is the biggest driver in your ability to accumulate
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.900]   wealth.
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.900]   When the listener asked the question in the thread, a few people commented.
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:52.220]   But we had two people pipe in with their contributions, two people who – both of whom have appeared
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:57.960]   on the show previously, Fritz Gilbert who writes at theretirementmanifesto.com and Rocky
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.220]   Lalvani who writes and blogs at Richersoul.com.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:05.780]   Both of them contributed and said, "We are 401(k) millionaires.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.380]   It can be done."
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.340]   But because I've interviewed both of these men on the show, I responded and said, "Both
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.360]   of you prove my point.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:20.340]   Both of you are experienced career people who have earned – I don't know their exact
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:26.020]   salary but just due to their job descriptions, I'm sure it's in excess of $100,000 a year.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:31.700]   You're six-figure income earners and if you use that high income and you apply some
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:37.920]   skills of thrift to that high income, you've been able to save a lot of money.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:43.400]   And yes, the 401(k) has worked for you but you also would have gotten wealthy simply
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:50.680]   because of your income and your thriftiness if the 401(k) weren't available to you."
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.340]   The 401(k)s didn't make them rich.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:31:00.660]   Their high income, high rate of savings and wise investment decisions made them rich.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:07.760]   And the structure of the 401(k) because of their corporate jobs worked well as a useful
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.620]   tool on their way to wealth.
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:15.460]   Let's talk about interest finally.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:22.420]   I think that the person who has access to a 401(k) meaning the structural difference,
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:27.980]   white-collar workers working in medium to larger corporations versus blue-collar workers
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:33.340]   working in smaller corporations who don't have access to 401(k)s, the person working
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:41.580]   in that is probably on the whole more likely to have access to better investment information.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.860]   Wealthy people talk about money.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.700]   Rich families talk about money.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:53.700]   And if you're a white-collar, you graduated from college, your parents are working professionals,
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.580]   it's more likely that one of them is probably going to have something to do with some aspect
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:03.460]   of finance, whether corporate finance or in the investment business of some kind, or at
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:08.860]   least that the topics of money are not going to be taboo.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:15.220]   There's a higher subscription rate to the Wall Street Journal among upper-class elites
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.560]   than among lower-class blue-collar families.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:25.460]   And so simply being around the topics of finance are going to lead to somebody being more comfortable
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:30.180]   with the topic of investing, which is going to lead to somebody being more comfortable
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:35.740]   with actually contributing their money to an investment account held within a 401(k).
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.260]   Possibly it might also lead to making better investment decisions.
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.780]   Even somebody who's not working in finance, if they just have a cursory relationship with
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.620]   the financial literature, every now and then they glance at the Wall Street Journal, every
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.660]   now and then they pick up Money magazine.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.020]   When they're going through an airport, they pick up a book on money.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.060]   They tune into a podcast on money.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.460]   They look on CNN Money and read an article about index funds.
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:03.020]   They're likely to recognize some simple truths such as asset allocation matters.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.460]   But these truths are not self-evident.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.740]   It's not self-evident that when you're sitting down filling out your 401(k) investment contributions,
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:18.620]   you should construct a portfolio consisting of various asset classes.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.580]   There's a higher chance that the lower-class blue-collar worker, if they have access to
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:28.220]   a 401(k), is going to sit down and choose mutual funds within the 401(k) based upon
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.220]   their stated return for last year.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.820]   There's also a higher chance that they're going to move routinely out of them.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:40.860]   I've seen it so many times in giving financial advice to people.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:45.100]   The information is sitting there, but if people don't seek it out, they're unlikely to make
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.380]   good decisions.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.060]   It's hard to read anything related to money and not recognize that investment expenses
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.820]   matter.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.500]   But who's more likely to be reading about money?
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:03.380]   The white-collar worker who, as they fire up their computer, just takes a quick look
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.220]   at CNN Money or Yahoo Finance?
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:12.660]   Or the person who's a blue-collar worker and doesn't work in front of a computer every
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.780]   day?
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.420]   You be the judge.
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:23.460]   There are some factors that can go against the white-collar worker, the most important
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.020]   of which is lifestyle factors.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.580]   Living in a fancier house, spending more money on fancier vacations, buying fancier, more
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.740]   expensive cars.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.380]   Those things can go against the white-collar worker.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:42.060]   But on the whole, everything is tilted in favor of them becoming wealthy with or without
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.980]   a 401(k) plan.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:54.660]   And it's my opinion that the 401(k) has a relationship more of correlation to their
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:59.240]   wealth than of causation.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.300]   That statement is not rigorously researched.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.260]   It is not verified by statistical analysis.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.720]   It's an opinion drawn from observation.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:15.280]   It could be wrong, but I have not seen any evidence that it is.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:22.040]   As I close today's show, I want to make one thing very, very clear.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:28.920]   None of these factors are an excuse for not becoming wealthy if a person has that as a
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   goal.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.240]   The blue-collar worker can become wealthy.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:40.420]   Every day on this show, you hear me talk about the strategies, tactics, and techniques that
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.720]   lead to wealth.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.080]   None of these are exclusively available to somebody because they come from the upper-class
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:54.120]   elite or because they come from the lower class.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.280]   It's available.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.620]   And the information is here available every day, just on my show, if nowhere else.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:07.100]   There's no reason why you can't become very wealthy in a blue-collar occupation, especially
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:11.620]   if you have access to some of the tools.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.240]   I think here I have a listener of the show that's corresponded with me somewhat frequently
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.940]   who works as a truck driver for one of the large packaged companies.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.340]   And this listener is a millionaire.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.140]   They've worked at this packaged company as a truck delivery person for a long time.
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.180]   They listen to my show and many other things while they're doing their work.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:32.580]   They have access to a 401(k) and that's a blue-collar profession, but they become very
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:40.740]   wealthy, high income, good access to these structures, and the 401(k) has worked effectively.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:46.100]   There's no reason why you can't use the tools at your disposal.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:50.540]   So I don't make any excuses for where someone is.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:58.420]   But this is why I discount the value of a 401(k) because it's not the fundamental cause.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.740]   The secret is not getting people to contribute more money into a 401(k).
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.740]   What was it?
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.140]   A few years ago, President Obama lobbied for and passed the MyRA program.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.140]   Remember that?
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.660]   I haven't kept a close eye on the program over the last couple of years.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:19.700]   But it was talked about as being a way for people who don't have access to a 401(k) to
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.820]   be able to gain access to an investment account that is simple, that allows automatic contribution
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:30.020]   from their paychecks into this account and thus make it simpler for them to save even
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.020]   if their employer doesn't offer a 401(k).
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.220]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:41.720]   Well, because the accounts are invested in government securities, that tweaks my conspiracy
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:47.760]   bug a little bit that one of the primary motivation may be to build and continue to build a market
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.180]   for government securities, but that's hard to prove.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.980]   This tweaks me a little bit.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.380]   My major complaint is it's not going to solve anything.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.900]   I haven't seen what's the participation and what's going on with that program, but it's
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.600]   not going to solve anything.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.300]   The reason that poor people don't contribute money to retirement accounts is not that they
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.480]   don't have access to a retirement account.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:16.860]   If you had the knowledge, the income, the inclination, just because you're poor doesn't
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.540]   mean you can't go down to a computer, use a computer at your local library or use your
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:26.040]   phone, open an account at Vanguard.com and put money into an IRA that gets automatically
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.300]   deducted from your bank account.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:36.380]   You don't need something special, a special program created, a whole new structure called
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.200]   the MyRA for you to participate.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.640]   You don't need it.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.900]   The MyRA program is not going to help poor people.
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:53.860]   What's going to help poor people is learning to make more money, increasing income, learning
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:59.660]   to be more thrifty, to be as frugal as possible in their circumstances so they can save more
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.820]   money and learning to invest wisely.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:08.940]   If I were bulk up poor, earning a low income, I would not be buying government securities
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.500]   as my primary tool of investment.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.340]   I think that's a dumb way to approach investing, especially when you're at the beginning of
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:21.020]   your career or at the lower levels of career earnings.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.340]   I don't think my discussion here is comprehensive.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.620]   There are other factors as well.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:28.700]   For example, there's a correlation between people who have access to 401(k) accounts
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.300]   to have access to other types of benefits.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:36.820]   White collar workers have much more stable financial lives than do blue collar workers.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.940]   A white collar worker who has access to a 401(k) plan probably also has access to other
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.500]   programs of insurance.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.820]   They have access to group health insurance.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:49.140]   A white collar worker who has access to a 401(k) plan and access to group health insurance
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:55.660]   is going to worry less about the month-to-month needs of their household.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.860]   If something happens that's difficult for them from a health perspective, they're going
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.820]   to be more well-covered.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.340]   They probably have a group disability program.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.000]   They probably have a health insurance program.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.500]   They have vacation time, sick time, et cetera.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:15.340]   So they're going to be able to get through difficult circumstances more easily than a
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.220]   blue collar worker.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.480]   This leads to a more stable financial life.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.180]   This leads to them being able to save more consistently over time.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:28.100]   Blue collar worker generally doesn't have access to many of those programs, often doesn't
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.200]   have access to group health insurance.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:35.300]   If they have health insurance, it's often going to be what they've found in the broader
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.960]   marketplace.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.060]   Many small employers don't offer health insurance programs and so they may be going with whatever
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.240]   they can find on the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare health exchanges online, which those
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.900]   programs are not – they're not exactly Cadillac programs.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:57.000]   In addition, there's a higher degree of uncertainty in the financial life.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.300]   They generally don't have access to nor are they educated about something like disability
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.540]   income insurance.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.000]   The white collar worker, if they get laid off, often gets laid off with a severance
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.140]   package of some kind.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.700]   If you get laid off from a job working as an electrician, there's no severance.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.000]   You go find another job.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.040]   Often a white collar worker will have a much more stable flow of wages.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.000]   Many times in the blue collar professions, wages will fluctuate significantly based upon
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.140]   the amount of work that your employer has.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:28.500]   If you're working in the construction industry and your employer is struggling for work,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.440]   you simply get furloughed without pay and you have to wait for that employer to get
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.400]   more jobs or you have to go and find a different job with a different employer.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.800]   So there are many other factors.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.640]   We could analyze this question forever.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:51.920]   But this is the fundamental reason why I am not convinced that a 401(k) is the massive
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.320]   golden ticket to wealth.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:05.120]   If you have access to a 401(k), you should very seriously consider participating.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.640]   I have things I don't like about 401(k) plans.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.400]   That should be evident.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:16.680]   But I'm not – it's not cut and dry.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.440]   I think in general, you always want to take advantage of the employer match.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.920]   That's free money.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.820]   You always want to take advantage of the employer match.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:30.600]   You probably want to take advantage of additional contributions to the 401(k) because for most
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:37.360]   people who have access to a 401(k), the only thing they can do to improve their tax planning
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   is to make contributions to the 401(k) because they're employees and they don't have other
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.600]   areas of investment.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.520]   The only thing they can do is to make contributions to the 401(k) and so that's probably the
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.520]   best thing to do.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:55.160]   In addition to that, many times, the people who are participating in a 401(k) have their
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:00.400]   primary career and that should be their primary focus because the earning potential of focusing
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   on that career is going to be higher than just about any other activity.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:12.160]   So if you have access to a 401(k), you probably should make that a primary tool of your wealth-building
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.840]   plan.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:21.680]   But don't confuse that tool with being the cause of your wealth.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.000]   Simply not.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:31.320]   The cause of your wealth is going to be increasing your income to a high level.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.200]   When you have a higher income, that makes it easier for you to live a nice lifestyle
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.440]   which when approached with an appropriate amount of thrift can leave many tens of thousands
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:47.360]   of dollars available for you to save and invest.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:55.680]   So high income, reduce lifestyle through thrift, free up a lot of money to save and invest.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.520]   The more money you can free up to save and invest, the richer you'll be in the future
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.820]   and then focus on investing that wisely.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.740]   Focus on doing that within the context of the 401(k).
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:12.260]   That will reduce taxes, search very carefully on the fees and expenses of the program, you
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.540]   want to lower those fees and expenses as much as possible, and study carefully your asset
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:21.020]   allocation to maximize the potential for long-term return.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:28.060]   If you do that consistently over the course of a long career, you very likely with a high
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:34.220]   degree of probability will wind up having a lot of money in your 401(k) and I'll rejoice
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.820]   with you about that.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.460]   But I won't think that it was access to the 401(k) that made you rich.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:46.940]   I'll repeat ad nauseum, you got rich because you earned a lot of money, you saved a lot
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.420]   of money and you invested wisely.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.980]   That's Joshua's myth busting on 401(k)s.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:00.380]   Don't confuse causation with correlation.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.940]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:02.940]   That's it for today.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.580]   If you'd like to support the work that I do here to help me get rich, I don't have
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.380]   a 401(k) but I'm still getting rich.
