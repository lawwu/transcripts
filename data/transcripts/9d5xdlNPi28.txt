[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.600]   All right, thank you all for coming.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.160]   This is something new for the Bogleheads,
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.360]   this accumulator track,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.240]   and I think we really want to grow
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.840]   this part of the conference.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.440]   So tell all your friends how great the conference is
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.640]   and get them all to come.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.180]   Because this is really important for us
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.760]   to grow this part of the Bogleheads.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.620]   You are all the future, I am the past.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.440]   Anyway, today I am very happy to have Chris Mamula with us.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.960]   Chris is the lead author of the Choose FI book,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.840]   which is a great book.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.520]   I did a podcast with Chris on the book,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.240]   a lot of great information on the Choose FI book.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.560]   He's a financial writer for Can I Retire Yet?
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680]   And personally, after poor experiences
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.120]   with the financial industry in his professional life,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.840]   Chris educated himself on investing and tax planning
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.760]   and now draws on his life experience
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.920]   to write about wealth building, do-it-yourself investing,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.640]   financial planning, early retirement, and lifestyle design.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.640]   And of course, my screen just went out.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce Chris Mamula.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.560]   Thanks, Rick.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.400]   Thanks for all.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.080]   Thank you for coming to listen.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.520]   And I want to just start by thanking Rick
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.240]   and also Christine Benz for having me on their podcast
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.000]   to kind of talk about FIRE and to bring me here
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.040]   to share the message of FIRE with the Bogleheads,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.280]   because I think it's important
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.400]   to be able to share this message,
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.520]   'cause in general, in the personal finance community,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.160]   as far as like prestige and respect,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.080]   I think FIRE is somewhere around like the GameStop people
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.680]   and like this guy who's making TikTok videos
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.760]   on how to get rich in three easy steps.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.520]   So don't let the Hyatt hear this,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.320]   but he tells you to steal your hotel soap,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.880]   step two, it's gonna save you $45 a month,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.280]   which you can then invest in the S&P 500,
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.800]   and you will be a millionaire.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.640]   There is a lot of bad ideas and always new ideas
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.360]   in finance and in personal finance in particular,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.320]   and many of them can be dismissed
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.680]   and some of them should even be laughed at.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.000]   But it is important to note that occasionally
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.160]   there is an idea that's based on really sound,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.240]   solid principles, and those ideas do tend to stick around.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.640]   And I was kind of thinking,
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.240]   what would be an idea that may resonate with Bogleheads
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.000]   that I could use as a parallel example
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.600]   to how I look at FIRE?
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.320]   An idea that maybe was initially laughed off and ridiculed,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.760]   and it stood the test of time.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.480]   And if you take a look at the headline,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.000]   if you're not familiar with the history of John Bogle
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.400]   and Vanguard and index funds,
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.440]   this kind of gives you the CliffsNotes version,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.560]   but it says, "40 years ago,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.000]   "the thought of buying a stock index fund was ridiculed.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.080]   "Why would anyone be satisfied with an investment
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.800]   "that promised nothing more than the same return
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.720]   "as the market?"
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.320]   Well, I think the reason that this stuck around,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.720]   there's a number of reasons,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.840]   but I think the biggest one is
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.320]   this whole Bogleheads philosophy
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.320]   and the things that John Bogle taught,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.800]   it was based on sound principles.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.920]   It was based on just simple math.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.680]   And something that I kind of learned after reading the,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.480]   this is the first book I ever read about investing,
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   was "The Little Book of Common Sense Investing."
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.400]   And something I learned after reading this
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.840]   is I started to find other people
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.520]   in this Bogleheads community.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.680]   And I found it was this organic community that grew up
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.360]   just 'cause the ideas were so sound
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.080]   and it was impacting people's lives.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.720]   So it wasn't like he had to go hire a marketing team.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.880]   This community grew around him.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.160]   And I think there's a lot of parallels
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.440]   between this community and the FIRE community.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.480]   And that's what I wanna share today.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.360]   So I really have two goals.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.800]   The first is I wanna challenge some misconceptions of FIRE
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.120]   and really change that perception
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.840]   of what it means to pursue it,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.400]   how it applies to people who embrace
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.720]   the Bogleheads investment philosophy.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.400]   And I think it applies to a bigger group
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.760]   than many people think.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.280]   And then I wanna demonstrate just the common sense principles
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.400]   and the simple math that backup FIRE
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.320]   and why I think this is an idea that has the potential
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.960]   to still be around in another 40 or 50 years as well.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   So I'm gonna start with a couple of misconceptions
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.880]   'cause I really think it's important
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.800]   to make people understand the why of FIRE.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.200]   Because if you don't start there,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.440]   the how is really not very hard,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.160]   but nobody's gonna ever try it.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.520]   So I think we need to address some of these misconceptions.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.560]   So the first one, the first myth that I came up with is
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.280]   it requires an extreme lifestyle.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.720]   And there's a couple of versions of this.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.960]   One is sure you can achieve FIRE,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.920]   but you have to have a massive income
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.480]   or better yet just be born into wealth
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.080]   and have your parents give it to you.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.840]   The second is you have to deprive yourself
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.480]   and in practice extreme frugality.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.400]   And you see this term thrown around everywhere.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.600]   And for whatever reason,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.360]   this one really rubs me the wrong way
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.320]   'cause I just don't feel that that represents it at all.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.680]   And then the third one is you must have
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.600]   some kind of special investing prowess
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.040]   or maybe you just got lucky with investing.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.720]   And so that's how you would get there.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.080]   But it's really not for the average everyday person.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   What's the reality?
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.600]   I can share my reality.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.640]   My wife and I, we were both first generation
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.240]   college graduates in our family.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.800]   For my family, I did at least have,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.320]   my parents gave me a solid foundation.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.720]   My mom was able to stretch a dollar
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.200]   and she gave me that sense of thrift.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   For my wife's family,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.360]   money was really a source of stress and anxiety growing up.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.480]   And I think having talked to many people
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.840]   in the fire community and knowing a lot of them,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.160]   I honestly think her experience
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.880]   is even more representative of mine.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.240]   And I think honestly, if you came from wealth
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.280]   and that's what you knew growing up,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.120]   it's actually harder.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.360]   And the key to fire is to live below your means,
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.920]   whatever that means for you,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.640]   and to develop a high savings rate.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.560]   And so if you're used to growing up in a certain lifestyle
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.760]   and you have to take a step back,
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.680]   that can actually make it harder.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.600]   So I think that's a big misconception
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.240]   and it's available to many people who are natural savers.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.440]   The second, as far as income,
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.880]   my wife started working at about $35,000 a year
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.160]   and I started a year after her at 40,000.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.440]   And at those salaries,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.560]   we started living off of her salary and banking mine,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.320]   just 'cause again, it gave us a feeling of security.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.480]   Neither of us ever made $100,000 in a single year.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.600]   To be clear, we did grow our salaries over time
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.160]   and I think we would have hit that.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.040]   But when my wife had our daughter,
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.800]   she was 35 years old and she decided
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.040]   she didn't wanna go back to full-time work,
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.360]   so she never has.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.640]   And at 41, I left my career as a physical therapist.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.320]   So we never really made it to that point
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.840]   where we were entering our peak earning years.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.280]   So you don't have to have a massive salary.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.360]   And as far as being a genius investor,
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.280]   the reason I'm standing here
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.080]   is because I had a horrible experience
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.320]   with the financial industry,
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.800]   as Rick alluded to in my introduction.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.520]   And just after doing a deep dive,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.640]   I got into FIRE blogs and these FIRE bloggers really helped me
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.480]   and through them, I found the Bogleheads
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.760]   and the Bogleheads helped me.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.040]   And it was just a lot of people who weren't in the industry,
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.680]   who weren't necessarily experts,
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.160]   who were just giving freely of their time.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.440]   And so I started writing as a way
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.120]   that I thought maybe I could give back and pay that forward.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.800]   So again, I think all of those myths
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.000]   are just that, they're myths.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.800]   And so how did we get to this point
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.720]   where we achieve financial independence
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.600]   and we achieve FIRE?
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.480]   I like the term being a valuist.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.560]   And you might look at that term
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.840]   and say you never heard of that before.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.440]   And that's 'cause I'm pretty sure we made it up.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.520]   When I was writing the book,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.280]   we crowdsourced it from the FIRE community.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.760]   And I wrote this book in conjunction
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.800]   with two guys that do the Choose FI podcast.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.240]   And somebody sent this in as a voicemail.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.400]   And it really resonated with me 'cause it really made it,
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.880]   it really felt like what we were doing,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.320]   even though I'd never heard the term,
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.400]   it really felt exactly like my wife and I were doing.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.720]   And so throughout our accumulation phase,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.760]   we were actually, and in my opinion,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.680]   and in contrast to the idea of suffering and sacrificing
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.680]   and extreme frugality,
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.920]   I felt that we were living better than most of our peers
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.200]   'cause we were spending money really freely
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.240]   on the things that mattered.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.760]   But at the same time,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.080]   the reason we were able to save so much
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.400]   is we were cutting pretty relentlessly
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.040]   on the things that didn't matter.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.640]   So I've shared my story in a bunch of podcast interviews
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.480]   and print interviews,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.120]   and some things kind of raised people's eyebrows
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.880]   that could be perceived as extreme frugality.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.080]   Even among the FIRE community,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.000]   we are extremely anti-debt in our house.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.480]   So like I said, we started living off my wife's salary
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.000]   whenever she was only making $35,000 a year.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.040]   And she had about 25,000
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.760]   from putting herself through school and a small car loan.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.680]   And so we managed to do that in about 18 months.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.800]   We wanted to be debt-free before we were married.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.640]   And since that time,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.400]   the only debt that we've ever had in our lives
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.800]   is a small mortgage, and we pay that off in eight years,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.080]   and we've never had debt again, and we still don't.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.000]   Never had a car payment,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.400]   never paid a penny of credit card interest
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.640]   in our whole life.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.240]   Part of the reason we didn't have car payments
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.480]   is 'cause we kind of drove crappy cars.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.480]   We just don't care about that.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.480]   And so that was what we did.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   Clothing and jewelry.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.600]   I mean, I'm not a great dresser by any means.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.480]   I don't even own like a watch or a wedding ring.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.320]   Presents.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.360]   This one really raises people's eyebrows,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.560]   but my wife and I, we just decided one year that,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.200]   you know, shopping,
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.760]   and for like birthday and Christmas presents,
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.520]   it was more of a pain in the butt, and we didn't enjoy it.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.240]   And we had everything we truly wanted.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.520]   So we just made an agreement to not exchange gifts,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.080]   and that works for us.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.880]   And technology, I don't care about that stuff.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.120]   So I don't have the newest phone
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.120]   or any of those types of things,
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.720]   and I never have, and probably never will.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.760]   So that slide might turn you off a little bit and say,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.120]   well, maybe this does sound like extreme frugality.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.600]   But there's other areas where we absolutely were not frugal.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.080]   We always chose to live where we wanted.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.640]   And our first year out of school,
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.240]   we were living in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area,
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.320]   and we kind of moved to the suburbs and bought the house
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.400]   and do the things like you're supposed to do.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.160]   And so my wife was commuting into downtown Pittsburgh.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.200]   It was about a 40-minute commute every day.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.360]   For me being a physical therapist,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.480]   it made sense to get away from the city.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.640]   There was better work opportunities.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.600]   But it was about a 50-minute one-way commute every day.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.080]   And within a year, I think we were living the American dream,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.600]   where we had the degree and the nice house and everything
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.800]   that you were supposed to want.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.600]   And we just realized this is not our dream.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.560]   So we kind of blew it up, and we sold our house
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.240]   after only 18 months, which is not a great financial move,
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.880]   but it was great for us.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.680]   We focused on that next phase of our life
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.840]   of what did we want it to look like.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.200]   So we focused on places where we could enjoy our work.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.740]   We focused on optimizing our commutes
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.240]   so we weren't spending the whole day sitting in the car
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.160]   and kind of building the lifestyle we wanted.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160]   And then when we reached this point of where we were kind
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.360]   of reaching financial independence,
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.560]   we thought, what do we want our life to look like?
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.160]   And at this point, it wasn't built around work.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.200]   It was built around the activities we wanted to do.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.240]   So where was a place we can get outside and enjoy
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.180]   our lives every day, which is what we like to do?
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.980]   And where was a great place to raise our daughter?
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.680]   So we up and moved across the country,
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.520]   and we now live in Ogden, Utah.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.280]   Other things that we really spent freely on
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.200]   is experiences.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.720]   Like we love outdoor adventure activities, sporting events,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.680]   music.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.880]   And we never skimped on any of that stuff
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.520]   and travel, and just to kind of give you a look at what
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.720]   our life looked like.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.240]   This is a much younger me.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.160]   We were in our 20s, and we went to Australia.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.400]   We climbed Kilimanjaro, and we did an African safari.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.760]   We got into mountaineering.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.040]   This was us in Ecuador, the highest we've ever
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.920]   been, over 21,000 feet.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.000]   I want to kind of pause on this one, because to me,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.040]   this is the antithesis of extreme frugality.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.000]   But growing up in Pittsburgh, it's
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.920]   a really religious community, and the religion
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.800]   is steel or football.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.240]   And so like every Sunday of my life, that's what we did.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.480]   We watched the Steelers.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.160]   And like I was born as they were entering this dynasty
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.880]   phase of one of the greatest teams ever.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.200]   Yeah, I don't remember it, because I was too young.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.280]   So what I remember is them stinking or being
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.980]   average for like a good decade.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.520]   And so finally, when I was in college,
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.840]   they made the Super Bowl.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.600]   And I was a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.560]   and I was working at a pizza shop because I needed the money,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.360]   and that was about 60% of my calories.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.800]   And I also traded the extras for beer.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.240]   So I needed that job.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.680]   And when you work at a pizza shop
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.060]   in the host city of the Super Bowl on Super Bowl Sunday,
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.820]   everybody wants off, so they said nobody could have off.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.440]   So after watching this all my life, I couldn't watch them.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.400]   And I always said if they made the Super Bowl,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.840]   it was something I was going to do.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.320]   And fast forward 10 years, they did make the Super Bowl,
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.160]   and they played in Detroit.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.320]   So my wife and I drove up and scalped tickets
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.400]   in the bathroom of a bar in downtown Detroit
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.560]   for like $5,000 a couple hours before the game.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.800]   And we went to the Super Bowl.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.280]   It was like a once in a lifetime experience.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.360]   And if you notice the picture, that's not Detroit.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.660]   So three years later, we ended up going again in Tampa
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.000]   and we saw one of the greatest games in NFL history.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.280]   So for some people that might sound frivolous,
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.240]   but to me it had meaning.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.500]   And again, that's what being a valuist means.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.920]   Fast forwarding again, we have our daughter.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.960]   We kind of brought her into our active lifestyle.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.880]   And it's not about dragging her to stuff that we like,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.560]   but as a little kid, she's been on Disney cruises.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.780]   Somehow during the pandemic,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.960]   she's become the world's biggest Dolly Parton fan.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.460]   So we've managed to make it to Dollywood with her.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.800]   But so what I would kind of just ask you to do
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.780]   is kind of reframe that idea of suffering
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.640]   and sacrifice and extreme frugality.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.000]   'Cause I find that it just does not ring true.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.200]   And the question I would say is, are you a valuist?
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.820]   And are you lining up your spending with your money?
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.760]   Because just from a practical standpoint,
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.360]   most people, I mean, fire, yes,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.200]   it's quick compared to a standard 40 to 50 year career,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.040]   but you're still talking about 10 to 20 years
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.200]   of having to go to work every day.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.160]   And if you're miserable,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.080]   you're not gonna stick with that.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.520]   So you have to find a way to make it enjoyable for you.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.040]   And it can't be sacrifice.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.360]   And so for me, that's kind of what fire is all about.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.320]   And that's how you're going to develop a savings rate
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.780]   and be able to stick with it.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.420]   The second fire myth is that fire people
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.340]   don't really retire.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.820]   It's kind of a Ponzi scheme.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.120]   And we're all just selling the dream.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.460]   So we can't really retire.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.820]   We aren't really financially independent.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.900]   So we just sell the idea of the next person
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.260]   who then buys our books and listens to our podcasts
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.100]   and whatever.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.580]   And then it keeps going down the line.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.940]   I included a picture of Bertie Madoff.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.520]   That's who I actually think of with a Ponzi scheme,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.280]   but he's not in the fire community.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.240]   My fire reality,
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.320]   I did quit my job on December 1st of 2017
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.400]   and walked out the door
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.580]   and I'm no longer a physical therapist.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.760]   I will say since then, I've published a book.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.600]   I've partnered on and taken over one of my favorite blogs.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.720]   This past year, I completed the CFP curriculum
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.800]   and I'm currently preparing to take the CFP exam
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.080]   in about a month.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.160]   And as you can see, I'm here, I'm publicly speaking
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.640]   and I've been on many podcasts to promote my ideas.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.880]   So there is some truth,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.740]   AKA I do still work even though I say I retired.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.560]   Also my fire reality though,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.340]   my income is about 80% less than what it used to be.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.860]   I also left behind paid vacation, sick leave
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.380]   and pretty nice healthcare benefits.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.660]   These days, instead of my schedule being controlled
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.160]   by an employer, I have complete control over my time.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.740]   I rarely have ever worked more than three
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.100]   or four hours a day.
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.360]   Like I said, we moved to the mountains
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.940]   and I'm generally outside four or five days a week.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.380]   And I'm extremely involved in my daughter's life,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.340]   volunteering at her school.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.500]   I coach her soccer team.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.560]   We typically travel five or six weeks a year as a family.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.700]   But I think even maybe more important than the big things,
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.620]   the things you see in the pictures,
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.060]   is just every day we eat breakfast together.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.740]   We spend like that first hour of the day,
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.100]   we talk to my parents on FaceTime
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.420]   'cause they're kind of shut in
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.580]   with everything going on in the world.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.180]   And my mom has some health issues.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.460]   I would get everything I need to get done during the day
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.060]   and I pick her up and again, I'm present.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.940]   And that's something that I think a lot of people,
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.900]   they look back and they regret
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.180]   that they didn't have that time with their kids.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.980]   And that's something I'd never wanted to regret.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.980]   So again, I'm kind of lining up with my values.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.540]   So I think I kind of retired.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.900]   So the second question though, it really doesn't matter.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.340]   Like when you read these fire stories
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.580]   and that's a common criticism
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.260]   and they didn't really retire.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.860]   It doesn't really matter if you think I retired
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.980]   or anybody else did.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.740]   I think the second question that's really important
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.580]   is how do you want to define your retirement?
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.180]   And that was kind of a perfect segue
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.580]   to end the last segment to bring us into here
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.540]   because the whole idea of retirement,
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.100]   it's kind of a quaint and dated idea
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.780]   and retirement is evolving.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.540]   So if you look at what happens to people
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.660]   when they do retire, many people do walk away.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.300]   They view it as never working again.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.220]   And many people struggle with purpose and meaning
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.300]   and they end up with depression and anxiety.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.540]   The rates increase significantly.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.900]   Many people, they save money their whole life
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.460]   and they turn around and because they're such,
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.900]   they become accustomed to being savers,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.980]   it's hard for them to spend.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.660]   And if you look at the data,
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.220]   many people spend way less than they could
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.380]   and they don't actually enjoy their retirement.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.660]   Many people save for this time in the future
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.860]   where it's going to be so great
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.860]   and they don't have their health
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.020]   to do the things they actually desire.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.660]   And they miss their kids growing up
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.500]   and their kids are gone
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.020]   and now they have all this free time,
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.460]   but what are you going to do with it?
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.780]   And so just remember,
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.140]   if you want a traditional retirement,
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.780]   by all means do it.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.780]   But just because that's how most people picture retirement,
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.700]   it doesn't mean that's what it has to mean for you.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.140]   And so I really kind of write
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.420]   and like to talk a lot about the whole idea
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.420]   of just redefining what retirement means.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.180]   And our third fire myth,
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.260]   this one you kind of hear a lot
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.580]   like when I talk to more sophisticated people
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.260]   in the financial industry
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.220]   and it says fire relies on the 4% rule,
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.180]   which is either naive and/or uninformed.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.100]   And this is actually,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.740]   I had a great conversation about this with Christine
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.660]   when I was on the Morningstar podcast.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.980]   So if you're not aware of what the 4% rule is,
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.980]   maybe we should start there.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.380]   And that's just a rule that tells you
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.460]   how much you can spend in retirement.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.980]   And so basically the idea is,
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.180]   if you have a portfolio on day one of your retirement,
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.540]   you can take 4% of it
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.620]   and then you're going to spend that same amount every year,
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.820]   whether the market's up 50% or down 50%,
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.060]   adjusting only for inflation
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.260]   so your lifestyle can stay the same forever
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.540]   and you're not going to run out of money.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.380]   This is a common rule.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.940]   We talk a lot about this in the fire community.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.860]   And we also talk about the inverse of that then
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.380]   is that if you can take 4%,
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.300]   then you know that you need 25 times your annual spending
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.020]   to know if you're financially independent.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.780]   What's the reality though?
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.580]   I don't follow the 4% rule.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.500]   I know almost everybody in the fire community,
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.500]   I don't know anybody that follows the 4% rule
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.420]   or traditional retirees for that matter.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.900]   And I don't even really know anybody
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.500]   that would argue that it's a rule.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.500]   But what we do is we use it,
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.220]   we call it the 4% rule of thumb or the 4% guideline.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.060]   And there's a couple of reasons
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.100]   I think this is a great thing to learn and to understand.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.420]   Number one is that it makes you kind of focus
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.420]   on what you're spending.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.180]   And many people don't pay any attention.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.100]   Most people don't budget or track their spending.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.980]   And so it's a requisite
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.100]   to know what 25 times your annual spending is.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.140]   You have to know what your annual spending is.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.580]   So it gets you to start focusing on that
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.540]   and know where your money is going.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.020]   And also it just gives you a place
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.500]   where you can create a goal.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.940]   And yesterday, if you were at the Bogleheads University,
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.100]   that's something that Jim Dahl talked about
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.740]   is having these smart goals.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.660]   And so if you have a defined goal,
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.540]   what we found is people start to take action.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.020]   So people that weren't saving at all,
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.260]   they learn this principle and it really turns things around.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.100]   And that's fine.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.140]   This goal is gonna change over time.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.700]   You're gonna discover that you may wanna spend
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.940]   more or less than you initially thought.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.380]   Maybe healthcare is more expensive.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.740]   And you're gonna learn these things and adapt,
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.860]   but at least you have a place that you're starting from
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.300]   and you have a goal in sight.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.420]   But I think there might even be a bigger
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.460]   and more important point about the whole idea
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.900]   of the 4% rule.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.740]   And that's it.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.580]   In the FIRE community,
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.940]   I think we're asking kind of hard questions
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.220]   and we're having big conversations
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.660]   that are kind of rare in our society
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.380]   where everything is just more, more, more,
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.860]   bigger, bigger, bigger.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.540]   And it's a question I really hope resonates
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.860]   with a room full of Bogleheads,
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.420]   especially if you've really kind of dove
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.580]   into all of John Bogle's work,
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.940]   not just what he's written about investing.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.500]   And that's a question is enough.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.540]   And I think it's a question we don't ask enough
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.380]   is how much is enough for you?
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.140]   And then once you have enough, what comes next?
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.900]   So I wanted to really kind of start with the why,
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.100]   but now I wanna kind of get into a little bit of the how,
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.500]   because I do think FIRE is based
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.740]   on some pretty solid principles.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.260]   Again, just based in common sense
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.180]   and some very simple math.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.020]   I will say, and I kind of really appreciated
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.700]   the conversation again in the Bogleheads University
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.420]   yesterday, I think Rick brought this up
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.740]   and he might not use the exact terminology,
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.300]   but I always talk about tactics and principles.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.660]   And so again, I think a lot of people,
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.700]   they learn a FIRE 'cause they read like one story
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.220]   of one blogger or one person
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.580]   that's featured in some article.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.220]   And they say, well, I could never do that.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.500]   And they miss the bigger picture
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.340]   that all the FIRE people,
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.540]   we kind of are all following the same basic common principles
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.100]   but the tactics are gonna look wildly different within that.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.460]   And so I wanna focus on the principles
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.420]   and that's what we kind of focused on
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.380]   when we wrote the book.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.620]   And that's what I wanna focus on in the talk.
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.900]   One thing I'll say is the Boglehead investment philosophy
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.700]   that we're gonna learn about here this weekend
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.420]   or this week, it's really endorsed and embraced
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.100]   by almost everybody in the FIRE community.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.580]   We talk about using that investment philosophy,
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.740]   you can achieve FIRE reliably in 10 to 20 years
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.660]   if you follow these principles.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.820]   If you look at a typical career,
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.700]   it's gonna take you about 40 to 50 years
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.980]   till you reach financial independence
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.260]   and you're able to retire.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.180]   And if we're being honest,
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.580]   most people in our society
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.100]   do not ever reach financial independence.
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.980]   They're highly reliant on social security
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.820]   by the time they reach retirement age.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.940]   So I think it's worth looking at
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.260]   what does the FIRE community do so differently
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.420]   than most people and what can we learn from it
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.700]   even if we're not gonna go all out
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.820]   and be trying to say 50% and then retiring early.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.700]   Well, there's only three levers that any of us can pull
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.220]   in the world of personal finance
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.300]   if we wanna achieve financial independence quickly.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.140]   And we can spend less, we can earn more
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.180]   and we can invest better.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.860]   And I think number three is kind of the sexy one.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.080]   That's the one we like to talk about
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.880]   is how do we invest better?
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.020]   But if you want to achieve financial independence,
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.780]   again, it's about creating this large spread
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.620]   between what you earn and what you spend.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.340]   And so we really need to focus on numbers one and two,
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.020]   spending less and earning more.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.660]   The reason for that, again, this isn't my opinion.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.580]   This is just based on, again, simple math
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.140]   and the rules of arithmetic.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.660]   So there's only really three factors
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.660]   that impact your compounding.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.100]   So if we go back to our friend,
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.740]   our soap stealing TikToker friend
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   at the beginning of the presentation,
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.680]   he got a lot wrong in his little idea.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.840]   But one thing he did really well
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.200]   is he was obviously playing with a compounding
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.040]   or a time value of money calculator.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.260]   And it's something that I think,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.920]   I wish a lot more adults knew how to do,
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.020]   let alone kids his age,
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.120]   and we'd be a lot better off as a society.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.480]   But you know, there's only three factors
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.380]   that impact compounding.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.220]   And again, this is something
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.120]   Christine talked about yesterday,
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.080]   but the first is the rate of return.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.440]   If you are a bogal head, if you are a passive investor,
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.240]   you know that you're gonna get the return
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.400]   that the market gives you.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.580]   We can maybe, at the edges,
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.580]   kind of tweak that a little bit
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.940]   with our asset allocation or whatever,
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.860]   but essentially you're gonna get what the market gives you.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.980]   So there's not a whole lot you can do there.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.980]   The time to compound is a big factor.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.740]   So a traditional retirement,
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.860]   you have 40 to 50 years for money to work for you.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.140]   By definition, if you're pursuing FIRE,
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.220]   you're cutting that down to one to two decades.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.780]   You're cutting that in half or less.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.500]   And so we actually have time working against us.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.620]   So that only leaves us one lever to pull,
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.260]   and that's to focus on increasing the amount
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.480]   that we save and we add to our investments.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.400]   So after the 4% rule,
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.120]   another favorite topic in the FIRE community,
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.920]   we talk a lot about savings rate.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.400]   And savings rate's really simple.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.200]   It's just how much you save divided by how much you earn.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.760]   And so there's really only two things you can do
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.240]   if you want to improve your savings rate.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.200]   You can either spend less or you can earn more,
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.340]   and either is valid and either is okay.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.400]   But in the FIRE community, we talk about frugality a lot,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.000]   and I think that's maybe where some of the idea
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.320]   of this extreme frugality comes from.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.400]   But I do think it's worth starting with frugality
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.240]   for a couple reasons.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.560]   One, it just tends to be a little bit faster.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.440]   You can tend to cut your spending quicker
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.600]   than increasing your earnings,
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.960]   although it's fine and you should be working on both.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.400]   But I think there's a second reason
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   that it's far less obvious
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.960]   why you should focus on your spending.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.200]   But if you can learn to be happy living on less,
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.980]   then that just equates to needing less
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.660]   to be able to be financially independent
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.680]   and to retire if that's what you choose.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.500]   And so going back to that 4% rule and the inverse,
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.600]   the rule of 25, if you want to live off $100,000 a year,
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.880]   that's perfectly fine, but that's gonna take,
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.520]   as a starting point, we'll say $2.5 million.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.360]   If you can learn to be happy living on half of that,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.780]   $50,000 a year, then you need half of that
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.080]   to retire, a million and a quarter.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.920]   So that's a much lower bar to save towards
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.420]   if you want to hit financial independence quickly.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:22.880]   A lot of these ideas, when we talk about savings rate,
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.320]   it comes from a really popular blog post
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.000]   from a really popular blog, Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.300]   And the article's called the Shockingly Simple Math
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.900]   Behind Early Retirement.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.980]   And in that, he uses some assumptions
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.540]   to kind of tie your savings rate
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.620]   to how long it's gonna take you
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.140]   to be financially independent.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.820]   And the assumptions he uses is that you're gonna get
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.580]   a 5% real return during your accumulation,
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.020]   and you're gonna utilize the 4% rule in early retirement.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.340]   And we can argue around the edges about that,
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.640]   but I think it's a really good place to start.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.900]   He came up with this slide that shows,
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.540]   like in 5% increments, your savings rate
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.380]   and how long it's gonna take you.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.900]   And that's obviously a really busy slide,
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.740]   so I'm gonna zoom in.
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.420]   So standard financial advice
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.220]   is you save 10 to 20% of your income.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.420]   And standard career is about 40 to 50 years,
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.240]   like we talked about.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.080]   And if you look at that,
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.820]   that lines up really nicely with that.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.900]   So if you want a standard career, follow standard advice,
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.820]   and that should get you there.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.300]   The problem, I think, for a lot of people,
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.860]   people say, well, saving 10% is hard.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.980]   Well, I think, how am I gonna save 50%?
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.820]   And I think a lot of this is a psychological game.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.260]   So I think a lot of the reason saving 10% is hard
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.020]   is because you're gonna see results really slowly,
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.220]   and you're not gonna notice any progress for a long time,
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.260]   'cause it takes a while to get compounding working for you.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.660]   And so a lot of people get frustrated,
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.580]   and they end up not saving anything at all.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.220]   Whereas, again, if you have this goal,
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.420]   and you have this plan to work towards your goal,
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.500]   it's actually not all that hard for many people.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.500]   And so in the FHIR community,
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.700]   we talk about starting thinking about a 50% savings rate.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.900]   And again, that can seem drastic
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.980]   if you don't have these other things in line first.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.060]   But if you have a 50% savings rate,
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.580]   or in that ballpark there,
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.540]   now you see where we're getting down
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.300]   to that one to two decades that we talk about,
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.100]   that you can reliably achieve FHIR
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.460]   following these principles.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.500]   I think, before we move on from that,
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.180]   I think it's important to zoom in.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.540]   And again, we talk about, with John Bogle,
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.340]   he always talked about the relentless rules
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.620]   of humble arithmetic.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.540]   And I kind of am even more simple,
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.940]   and I say, just say the math is the math.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.540]   And so a lot of people, they'll maybe hear my story,
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.700]   and they'll say, you know, that's kind of cool.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.620]   I wish I would have thought of that when I was 25 or 30,
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.740]   but I'm already 45 or 50.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.580]   But guess what?
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.740]   The math is exactly the same
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.740]   if you're saving aggressively
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.760]   for one decade early in your career,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.200]   or one decade late in your career,
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.300]   or 15 years early, or 15 years late.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.560]   And so this is a message that could help a lot of people
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.660]   who are late savers and behind the game.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.540]   And why is that important?
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.420]   Well, we see that there's a lot of people behind the game.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.920]   So this is a very recent study
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.580]   from Vanguard's How America Saves 2022.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.740]   I'd say these balances are probably pretty bloated,
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.540]   being from the end of 2021,
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.380]   compared to what we have today.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.380]   But if we look at people,
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.420]   those last two lines is what I want you to zoom in on,
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.380]   the 55 to 64 and the 65 plus.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.580]   This is a kind of a skewed sample,
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.060]   'cause it's people that have retirement accounts
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.640]   with Vanguard, so they're probably better
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.480]   than the average person.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.940]   Many people don't have any retirement account,
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.220]   and some that do have ridiculous fees,
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.340]   and they're not maybe getting the same advice.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.440]   But even in this crew, at that retirement age,
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.300]   we're looking at about a quarter of a million dollars.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.220]   So if we go back to that 4% rule,
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.200]   these people can take about $10,000
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.780]   from their portfolio in retirement,
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.540]   less than $1,000 a month.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.020]   So they really need help catching up to,
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.180]   if they wanna do anything more than just supplement
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.980]   social security and live on a pretty bare bones existence.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.740]   And the average tends to be skewed up,
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.860]   'cause you're gonna have people with two
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.980]   or $3 million in their account.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.420]   So if we look at the median,
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.020]   that's even more representative, I think,
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.940]   of the average person.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.580]   And again, this is already a kind of a privileged sample,
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.140]   like above average sample compared to the general society.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.140]   And we're looking at people that have less than $100,000
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.220]   if you look at the median.
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.660]   So again, if you're looking at 100,000, 4%,
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.540]   you're talking people can take $4,000 for the entire year
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.980]   to supplement their social security,
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.340]   and that's what you have to live on.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.140]   So again, people need a lot of help.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.660]   Now, while the math is the same,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.060]   what's really important to understand
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.780]   is if you're a late saver,
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.300]   or if you know somebody that's a late saver,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.980]   and you can get them to kind of buy into
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.340]   some of these principles and take them to heart,
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.300]   there's actually a lot of advantages that you have
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.340]   if you're saving late versus the typical fire person.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.900]   I would say, I'm gonna acknowledge off the top,
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.700]   the one big disadvantage, if you haven't been saving at all
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.660]   or haven't been saving much for 20 or 30 years,
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.860]   it may be challenging to change that habit,
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.260]   but if you can accept these principles
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.220]   and you can start down this path,
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.620]   there's a lot of advantages.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.580]   If you're early in your career,
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.700]   if you just think about where you're at in the life cycle,
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.900]   you tend to be early in your career
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.060]   where you're making less money.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.260]   Maybe you're forming your family,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.300]   so you're still paying for diapers and daycare
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.500]   and saving for college.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.620]   When you're later in your life,
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.300]   you tend to be entering your peak earning years,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.380]   like we talked about, my wife and I,
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.260]   we left before we ever got there.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.460]   You may have a mature family
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.580]   that you have all these expenses in the rear view mirror,
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.660]   or the kids are starting to go to college and moving out,
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.420]   and you can redirect that money to retirement savings.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.780]   And if you have kids moving out,
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.020]   it might be a time to downsize,
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.500]   and one of the biggest ways you can save
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.380]   when you're spending is to cut your housing costs,
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.420]   and this could be a perfect time to do it.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.420]   There's also greater tax advantages.
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.380]   One of the best, simplest things you can do,
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.260]   Mike Piper talked about this yesterday,
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.420]   is just utilize your retirement accounts to the max
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.860]   and utilize your HSA, and get as much tax advantage
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.380]   from your investments as you can.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.180]   Well, as you get older, you have catch-up contributions,
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.020]   so those contributions get even bigger,
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.020]   and it gives you a little more space to work with there.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.180]   And then you just have less,
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.780]   it's just less hard to plan for a traditional retirement.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.540]   Still not an easy task, still 30 years,
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.780]   a lot of uncertainty, but compared to 60 years,
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.660]   it's a lot easier to plan for that.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.500]   You also have a floor under you
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.060]   with your Social Security income,
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.580]   so you may not need to save 25 times,
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.140]   because you have that Social Security
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.660]   supplying some of your spending.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.700]   And you also have Medicare, which it's not free,
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.940]   and it's not perfect by any means,
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.980]   but compared to what we have to deal with
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.980]   to bridge that gap from working to traditional retirement,
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.540]   for somebody like myself, I have 25 years,
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.140]   and the laws change every couple of years,
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.220]   and it's really hard to plan
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.980]   when you don't know what the rules are.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.180]   So, I wanted to kind of leave some time for questions,
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.820]   so I want to kind of go through, fairly quickly,
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.100]   we talked about spending less, earning more,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.980]   and investing better, and so I want to kind of close on that.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.860]   And so, what are the things you can do
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.100]   to develop a high savings rate?
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.740]   So, probably our third big topic
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.340]   that we love to talk about in the FHIR community
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.260]   is the big three.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.660]   So, we always start by focusing
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.860]   on housing, transportation, and food.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.660]   And this isn't because FHIR bloggers
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.180]   love to tell you what to do.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.260]   Again, it comes down to simple math, okay?
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.420]   So, for the average American household,
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.460]   50% of your expenses is going to come from these big three,
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.420]   housing, cars, and food.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.020]   So, I kind of like to picture this as like a big pie chart,
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.940]   and it fits a big circle,
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.260]   and you just cut it down the middle.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.260]   And on one side, you have housing, cars, and food,
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.140]   and on one side, you have everything else.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.980]   And some people will say,
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.740]   "Well, I don't want to cut on my housing, cars, and food."
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.180]   And if you want to have a high savings rate,
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.940]   that means you essentially cut everything else,
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.340]   and I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.500]   To me, that's the definition of extreme frugality.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.300]   But if you can optimize on those big three
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.260]   and develop a reasonable savings rate,
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.580]   that sets you on your way,
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.700]   and that's where you want to focus your energy to start.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.620]   And again, for some people, this is going to feel like,
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.260]   this is going to feel like frugality and sacrifice,
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.260]   because I think we've been sold
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.620]   that the American dream is to have
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.940]   the biggest house you can have
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.060]   and the most expensive car you can drive,
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.460]   and a lot of people have bought into that dream.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.940]   And so it does require a mindset shift.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.180]   If that slide got you down,
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.460]   I think everything gets a lot easier
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.380]   once you have a pretty decent savings rate,
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.980]   because now you're just throwing gasoline on the fire.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.560]   I have never met anybody who said,
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.180]   "My life would be so much better
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.000]   "if I could just pay a few more dollars in investment fees,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.180]   "if I could pay a little bit more in taxes,
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.580]   "if I could pay some extra insurance premiums,
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.580]   "or I love to travel, but if I could just spend more on it."
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.340]   But all those things, once you master your finances,
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.220]   you can really cut dramatically.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.820]   A lot of people, and again, in the Bogleheads,
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.500]   this is something we talk about a lot, is investment fees,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.860]   but it really doesn't matter if you don't have much invested.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.600]   But as your investments grow,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.700]   if you have a million dollars
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.140]   and you cut that from a 1% fee to a 0.05% fee,
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.380]   you're talking about saving almost $10,000 a year.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.800]   I mean, that's massive.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.640]   Taxes.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.800]   Mike Piper talked about this a little bit yesterday.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.200]   Some of the simplest things you can do
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.080]   are also the most effective.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.960]   Just max out your retirement accounts
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   and defer those taxes in your high-earning years.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.000]   And by definition, you have a high savings rate
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.560]   and you have a lower cost of living.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.800]   And if you retire early or even semi-retire or whatever,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.740]   and you can spread that out over 20 or 30 years,
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.720]   you can pay much lower taxes.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.880]   Early retirement lifestyle is just,
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.320]   and this whole financial independence lifestyle
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.560]   is just generally very tax-friendly.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.160]   If you kind of like, again,
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.060]   I'm not really truly fully retired.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.180]   We still have some income, but our income's low enough
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.800]   where now our capital gains are tax-free.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.080]   So we don't have any of that tax drag
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.060]   even on our taxable accounts.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.640]   Just having a lower consumption lifestyle,
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.900]   you'd cut out all those sales taxes.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.960]   If you don't live in as big and expensive a house,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.400]   you tend to have less property taxes.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.320]   So if you don't like paying taxes,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.520]   this is a great way to cut them, all these things.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.640]   Again, insurance.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.640]   If you don't have any savings,
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.480]   every little thing that happens can kind of be an emergency.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.720]   And so you need a lot of insurance in your life.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.240]   But as you have a couple of years of savings,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.880]   paying for a short-term disability policy
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.280]   maybe doesn't make sense anymore.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.160]   If you're getting to 20 and 30 years of savings,
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.200]   having a long-term disability and having a life insurance
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.080]   doesn't make much sense anymore.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.640]   If you have enough money to cover expenses,
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.060]   you can start raising your deductibles
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.480]   and lowering your premiums on everything from auto
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.800]   and house and healthcare insurance.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.160]   And so again, insurance gets a lot cheaper.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.440]   And then travel expenses.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.840]   I kind of put this at the end.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.280]   This is kind of one that excites people.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.480]   And again, this is something in the FHIR community
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.920]   we like to talk about, but using travel credit cards
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.960]   and their credit card companies know
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.360]   that they charge an outrageous fee
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.600]   and most people are not gonna benefit by that.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.480]   And so they're willing to give some pretty outrageous bonuses
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.160]   to sign up for their cards
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.240]   because most people are gonna end up paying 15 or 20%.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.960]   But if you can master your finances,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.320]   you get in a position where,
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.660]   even if you have to put things on a card,
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.480]   you have the money to easily pay it off
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.120]   and you're not gonna be paying these fees,
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.480]   you can collect a lot of rewards.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.880]   And I typically, our family,
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.480]   just signing up for four or five cards a year,
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.320]   we collect about four to $5,000 of free travel
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.720]   in the course of every year.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.080]   The other side of the equation,
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.280]   again, we talk a lot about spending less,
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.880]   but it is important to earn more.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.200]   And again, I think it all comes down to that.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.120]   Still, it's a value proposition.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.040]   So yes, a lot of people say everybody should go to college
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.200]   at any cost and there's no other investment in the world
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.120]   that we say that about.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.640]   We wouldn't say, is a house a good investment?
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.040]   We would say, at what price?
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.520]   Is a stock a good investment?
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.720]   We were talking today about valuations.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   Everything is what price.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.200]   But with college, we just kind of throw our brain out
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.360]   and just take these big loans on
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.800]   and then this ends up in the position
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.560]   that we're stuck in as a country right now.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.440]   So in the FIRE community,
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.520]   we've talked a lot about different ways
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.880]   to get your education for less.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.560]   And I can tell you in my story, again, my wife and I,
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.240]   between us, we have six college degrees
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.720]   and plus a bunch of different certifications.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.520]   We're like education junkies.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.840]   And again, we've never had any debt
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.000]   except for my wife's initial bachelor's.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.200]   So it is possible and it is doable.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.920]   Then you wanna kind of just grow your earning power
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.600]   through your career and build a network
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.400]   and all these things just to kind of allow you to make more.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.320]   And then the final step.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.480]   So once you grow your savings rate,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.040]   you do have to do something to grow your investments
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.800]   and how do you invest better?
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.040]   I would say on this whole panel of speakers
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:12.920]   at this conference this weekend,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.760]   I am the least qualified person.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.880]   The other people here speaking
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.640]   are the people whose books I read,
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.960]   their blogs I read, their podcasts I listen to.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.160]   So what I would say is just enjoy
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.640]   the rest of this conference, suck up as much as you can,
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.360]   and then take it out and pay it forward to your community
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.400]   and help people out.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.760]   And that's really what this is all about.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.040]   And I wish you all the best
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.480]   on your journey to financial independence.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.800]   And if anybody has questions,
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.160]   I'm happy to stay and talk as long as you need.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.280]   (audience applauding)
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:49.360]   - And I appreciate the slide you put on at the end
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.040]   about earning more.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.240]   I see a lot of people in the FIRE community,
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.920]   FIRE bloggers, authors, et cetera,
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.600]   that are just crazy about saving,
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.960]   saving, saving, saving, saving.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.240]   And very rarely do they ever talk about earning more.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.840]   And in my experience, people dramatically overestimate
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.200]   the difficulty of doubling their income.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.640]   Why doesn't the FIRE community talk about earning more,
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.600]   more than they do?
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.840]   - You know, that's a good question.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.920]   I can't speak for other people,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.320]   but it is something that, I mean, in the book,
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.000]   we devoted a section to each of those three levers
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.800]   of spending less, earning more.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.680]   So in my own personal story, I do focus on that.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.600]   And again, in my own personal story,
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.920]   like it would be hypocritical,
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.240]   like I know a lot of people get anti-college or whatever.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.640]   I absolutely benefited from having three degrees,
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.520]   and my wife has three degrees.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.280]   But again, you have to look at the cost benefit.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.200]   And so even when you are focusing on earning more,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.400]   it's all kind of the same thing.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.720]   You have to look at the value proposition,
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.080]   and you still have to look at what you're spending.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.480]   But I absolutely agree with you,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.880]   and I wouldn't argue with you.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.920]   I think maybe the only thing I would argue is,
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.480]   I think a lot of people think that if you earn more,
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.240]   it'll get easier to save.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.480]   And in theory, I agree with that.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.040]   But if you look at the data,
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.480]   what most people do is they earn more,
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.840]   and they just inflate their income.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.440]   And their spending grows right with their earnings.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.960]   So most people don't save more.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.000]   And you can look at like professional athletes,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.240]   you know very well with doctors, you know the statistics.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.160]   So that's just the reality.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.040]   So there is a practical reason too, I think.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.280]   But I think it's worth working on both,
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.200]   but that's why we focus on spending first, at least I do.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.120]   - Hello, hello, yes.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.160]   My question is regard, how do you know emotionally
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   transition from accumulation to, you know,
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.680]   spending your portfolio?
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.360]   My wife and I, we were thinking,
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.280]   we reach our FI number this year.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.880]   And, but we don't know, you know,
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.680]   we were now scouting, you know, where to retire,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.240]   where to go, but inside of us,
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.480]   we are a little bit afraid if, you know,
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.880]   if this doesn't work, you know,
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.040]   and what we are going to do, you know,
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.760]   we still have about 25, 30 years
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.360]   until we get hit our social security, you know, benefits.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.600]   So how was, in your experience,
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.960]   that transition from working
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   and just to, you know, living the FI, the fire life?
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.680]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.640]   In my personal situation,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.400]   it really wasn't a question of like,
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.680]   we didn't look at, did we hit some target number
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.680]   and were we ready to retire?
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.800]   My wife and I, we kind of always wanted to move West
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.680]   and just do something different.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.800]   I'm from Pennsylvania, but like I said,
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.720]   we live in Utah now.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.880]   And so we had a daughter and she was turning five
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.400]   and she was starting kindergarten.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.320]   And for us, it was really a lifestyle decision of
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.160]   once she starts school and making her friends
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.120]   and getting involved in activities,
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.560]   it's going to be a lot harder to shift gears
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.440]   and to change to that.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.200]   So that was kind of our initial decision.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.280]   And we always, I mean, originally,
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.960]   I think just like most people,
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.840]   I had that same vision of retire is don't work at all.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.080]   You live off your investments.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.400]   But then as you kind of get closer
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.720]   and you start thinking about it,
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.400]   what are you going to do for purpose?
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.960]   What are you going to do to just fill your time?
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.000]   Like my daughter's in school.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.800]   And so what am I going to do all day?
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.680]   And also it's just a psychological component.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.360]   Like you don't save 50% of your income
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.040]   because you are suffering and sacrificing for 15 years.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.520]   You save because it feels good.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.280]   And so imagine like you're driving down the road
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.120]   at 80 miles an hour,
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.880]   and then you're just going to slam it in reverse.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.800]   That's basically what you're doing,
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.440]   going from like a 50% savings rate
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.960]   to spending for your portfolio.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.600]   So our plan was always to be very gradual and cutting back.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.000]   So my wife has a remote job.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.040]   She works for a company out of Washington, D.C., part-time.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.040]   Like I said, after having our daughter.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.880]   Shortly after that, she started with that company.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.680]   And she was the seventh employee.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.520]   It was a startup.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.760]   So they kind of just give her a really sweet deal.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.680]   And so she's able to work part-time.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.540]   And I plan to keep my physical therapy license.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.640]   I thought I may work part-time
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.120]   or do a travel assignment once or twice a year.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.600]   And our investments did really well.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.760]   I did better than I thought with our book and blog.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.480]   And so I just kind of let my license expire.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.320]   And I am, I guess,
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.640]   completely retired as a physical therapist.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.480]   Now I'm not going back.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.920]   But yeah, that was kind of always our plan,
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.840]   is to have a gradual transition.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.840]   And so it'll be five years for us in December.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.840]   And my wife is, again, looking to cut back working.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.440]   This year, kind of cut back our hours again.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.360]   But we're kind of still like,
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.440]   most months, we are just basically right about even.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.280]   So every now and then,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.860]   if we have expenses, we'll take from our savings.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.680]   Every now and then, if I have a good month,
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.900]   we'll put a little bit into savings.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.280]   But we're not drawing down much.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.160]   We're not saving anymore.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.200]   And it feels very comfortable.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.120]   It's a nice transition point.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:28.600]   - You didn't cover one of the observations
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.020]   I know about a fire committee I see as a downside.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.440]   But at least the more vocal fire proponents
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.360]   really seem to hate their job,
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.200]   to the point where they will blog about it.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.800]   And they just want to get out in 10 or 20 years.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.880]   I'm not sure, it's like,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.120]   do you think that's representative?
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.320]   Or maybe just the loudest, voiceless in that community
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.280]   is basically doing it that way.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.700]   And I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about that.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.380]   - I'll be honest with you.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.940]   I don't read a lot of fire blogs anymore,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.980]   'cause I'm kind of like, I'm at that transition stage.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.300]   So I don't know what's out there now.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.760]   I do think sometimes the loudest, most extreme voices
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.600]   get the most attention.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.720]   That's just natural.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.260]   I mean, my personal opinion,
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:11.900]   I think if you are two to three years away from fire,
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.980]   and you, I think it's a rational decision.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.900]   If you have a high paying job to maybe put your nose down
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.780]   and just get through it and hit your number and then quit.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.300]   But if you're starting your career
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.420]   and you know that's not what you want to do
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.700]   to suffer and sacrifice through it.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.820]   I mean, I think there's a lot better ways
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.660]   to go through life.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.940]   I mean, I wouldn't recommend suffering
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.260]   for the next 10 years to reach this number
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.180]   that there's no guarantee you're ever going to get there.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.100]   So you got to live your life and enjoy it along the way.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:43.300]   - So one question of interest in this is,
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.500]   it seems like there's accumulation, accumulation of,
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.100]   and it has to be taxable investments at this point,
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.260]   if you're going to be living off of it.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.620]   Is there a trade-off here where you're just bypassing
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.980]   401k matches, long-term taxable income,
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.700]   or tax-free earning on those things
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.500]   to achieve this other side?
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.500]   Are you passing up those company matches
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.540]   because you're focused on being away?
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.000]   And is that a trade-off that's worth it?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.100]   I don't know if that makes sense or not.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.100]   - Yeah, I mean, I would say in general,
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.620]   I hate to give one-size-fits-all advice,
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.780]   but passing up a company match is one,
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.460]   unless maybe, like if you have a ton of credit card debt,
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.220]   something like maybe, but you're getting a tax advantage
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.020]   and you're getting just a free 100% return.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.380]   So I personally would never pass that up.
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.260]   But beyond that, I mean,
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.020]   when we were in our accumulation years,
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.860]   I mean, if you're saving enough,
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.140]   again, unless you're really doing
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.060]   the extreme frugality version of this,
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.540]   I mean, for us, we maxed out both of our 401ks,
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.480]   then we maxed out both of our Roths.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.540]   And in the one year we had the option to,
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.500]   we maxed out our HSA,
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.940]   and then we still saved a substantial amount
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.100]   in taxable investments.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.340]   So we ended up, we have a pretty nice mix
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.980]   and a lot of diversification amongst asset,
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.220]   or amongst taxable types of accounts.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.860]   But I think if you aren't in that position
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.740]   and you have to make a decision,
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.140]   I don't know how I would answer that question.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.460]   For many people, I think you have to look
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.720]   at your own situation and where you're gonna be.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.380]   (man speaking indistinctly)
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:14.040]   (man speaking indistinctly)
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:31.100]   Yeah, there is ways to get money out of your 401k.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.380]   There's, you have to jump through some hoops,
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.340]   but like there's, you can do, it's called a 72T,
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.040]   and you could take like, kind of almost equivalent
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.700]   to RMDs, but you're doing it earlier in your life.
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.660]   So once you do it, you have to do it
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.380]   for a period of at least five years.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.420]   And there's ways to do it.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.620]   Also, you could just pay the penalty,
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.580]   and sometimes that still might be better than paying,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.060]   depending what your tax rate is.
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.620]   If you're in a much lower tax rate in retirement
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.620]   and you're paying the 10% penalty,
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.040]   that still might work out in your advantage.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.140]   So again, it's really hard to give specific advice
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.180]   to a general audience.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.540]   You have to kind of look at your own situation.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.500]   - Hello, just a general question.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.400]   One of the big threes that you mentioned was housing.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.040]   Do you have any advice for people living
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.840]   in high cost of living cities?
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.240]   I'm from New York City, work in New York,
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.160]   make a good living in New York,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.160]   but I find that the housing costs are extreme right now.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.000]   Any general solutions?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.720]   I mean, besides living with a roommate,
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.460]   because I'm doing that now,
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.380]   but any other advice you could give?
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.940]   - No, I mean, I think, again,
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.460]   we kind of talk about principles, right?
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.100]   The principle is you have to do less,
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.460]   but then there's the tactics
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.480]   and how are you actually going to do that?
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.420]   I think one thing in a high cost of living area,
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.460]   like I guess my question would be, why are you living?
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.020]   Like, is that where your family is?
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.240]   Is that where you want to stay?
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.420]   'Cause like, I think some people go there
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.460]   because there's higher paying job opportunities,
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.700]   but then you can always move to a lower cost
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.740]   if that's where you want to live.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.840]   Now, if you want to stay in the higher cost of living area,
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.280]   I think like a roommate is a great idea.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.600]   I mean, you're kind of limited by your creativity
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.720]   once you understand the principle,
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.000]   but yeah, I mean, if it's a super,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.760]   like if you're in the Bay Area or in Manhattan,
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.300]   yeah, I mean, it's expensive to live there
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.680]   and it's going to take up more of your,
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   so it's a decision is, is that worth it?
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.480]   Is it worth it to go somewhere else?
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.720]   And that's a personal decision that you have to make.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.040]   - Now, I grew up in New York,
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.540]   lived there and I'm working there.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.380]   It's a little, because I'm in the insurance business,
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.300]   but I'm an attorney, so I'm practicing there.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.580]   So, I mean, I guess looking to practice elsewhere,
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.260]   I'd have to take the bar unless it's a UBE state,
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.620]   but that's pretty much.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.740]   - Yeah, I think again, like I think a lot of it
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.380]   is just what do you really want?
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.420]   Like, again, like my wife,
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.340]   she works for a company based out of Washington DC,
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.140]   but she worked for them when we were in Pennsylvania
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.420]   and she works for them when we're in Utah.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.820]   And so some, like, especially now since the pandemic,
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.540]   a lot of jobs, if that's an option,
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.400]   but again, if your family's there,
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.640]   is that a sacrifice you're willing to make?
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.240]   Again, we did move away from our family,
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.320]   but it was because of other reasons.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.880]   And those are always hard decisions
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.320]   and I can't give you a good, easy answer on them.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:19.880]   - Hello, my name's Chris, I'm from the DC area.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.720]   - Yes.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.200]   - I just wanna start off by thanking you
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.160]   for revealing some of the particulars.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.880]   For example, somebody who's still working their way
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.700]   up the income curve, you know, I didn't really think it,
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.980]   you know, it could be possible to achieve FIRE,
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.420]   you know, without, you know, six figure and above income.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.580]   So that was really encouraging, so thank you for that.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.660]   I'm curious, 'cause one of the things
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.260]   that I don't hear too often in the FIRE community
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.060]   is the discussion of how you think
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.100]   about paying for a child's education.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.280]   I know a lot of Bogleheads will think
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.820]   that you should always put your retirement first
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.220]   because, you know, your child can always borrow for college,
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.220]   but I'm just curious if those are things you think about
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.160]   and what kind of ideas you have there.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.200]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.280]   So that is something when I was,
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.840]   when we were, our last five years
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.520]   of saving for financial independence,
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.480]   we were cutting those investment fees and tax fees
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.520]   because we were, I was also learning the investment side
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.060]   while I was going down the FIRE hole.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.880]   And so I had a lot more money
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.880]   that we were already saving that was freed up.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.800]   And so, and also I took a little, a side job.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.560]   It was just because we couldn't get out.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.680]   Like we, I like rock climbing and I couldn't get out
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.040]   and do stuff because it was a drive
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.880]   from where we used to live.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.920]   So I took a job with a local university.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.480]   So all I did was that little side hustle money.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.200]   I threw all that into account for her.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.080]   And in six years of teaching,
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.600]   right before we left for Utah,
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.560]   I kind of maxed out what I wanted to save for her
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.760]   for her school.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.040]   And so we stopped saving when we stopped working.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.480]   So yeah, we front loaded it.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.040]   And just like we front loaded our retirement savings.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.560]   - So I'm from Nashville.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.240]   Shout out to Dolly.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.600]   We like, your daughter liking Dolly.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.640]   My question is specifically for healthcare
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.160]   because I'm a nurse and I work in a trauma center
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.160]   and we see terrible things happen all day
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.840]   for people who were retired
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.200]   and now their whole life is gonna change.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.600]   What does the fire community say
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.680]   about getting ready for whatever particular catastrophe
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.520]   might come your way?
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.080]   You hope it doesn't, but what would they do?
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.080]   What does the fire community say about that?
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.520]   - Yeah, I mean, this is one area where I do differ
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.880]   with some people from the fire community
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.680]   who are way more risk tolerant or maybe naive
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.680]   than if I want to be not as diplomatic about it.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.440]   But to me, health insurance is absolutely a must
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.280]   for everybody.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.400]   I mean, it's just such a huge risk.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.880]   And so just like any entrepreneur,
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.080]   you have to figure out how you're going to get it.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.160]   I did do like a deep dive.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.240]   I know some people like the health share ministries.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.280]   For me, I just, for personal things
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.360]   with like kind of the activities we do,
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.360]   like adventure activities,
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.640]   they wouldn't cover some of those things.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.600]   And my wife has a preexisting condition it wouldn't cover.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.880]   So it wouldn't work for us,
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.160]   but that is an option that's cheaper.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.920]   I think for most people, they try to optimize.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.800]   And this is what we're going to do when my wife cuts back
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.560]   is try to optimize on our subsidies
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.680]   and just go through the ACA.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.720]   But again, it's a big challenge because again,
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.800]   they passed the law, I guess, what are we in 2022?
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.680]   Midway through 2021.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.840]   So it didn't do any good to plan
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   'cause you're already halfway through the year
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.040]   improving the subsidies.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.400]   And it only went through this year
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   and now they passed it again,
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.560]   but that takes us three more years.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.080]   But again, for myself, I'm 46.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.480]   So that still leaves me 16,
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.040]   trying to do math on the flyer, 16 years till Medicare.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:24.880]   Yes, I don't know.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.560]   We're going to, it's kind of, again,
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.640]   I think maybe a reason to over-save a little bit,
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.640]   a reason to, if you can be open to having some income
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.160]   in a way that's enjoyable, ways to pay it.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:46.840]   Food.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.600]   Yeah, it depends.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.160]   I mean, if you have a low enough income,
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.000]   you can get your insurance subsidized to a high level
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.400]   and you can pay very low premiums.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.600]   And also, but then you also have
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   the other side of the equation.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:04.000]   That's not the only uncertainty.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.120]   You also don't know if you're going to be healthy.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.960]   So even if you have insurance,
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.680]   you can have some substantial out-of-pocket costs
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.520]   in a given year.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   So you have to look at what your potential max
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.720]   out-of-pocket is.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.880]   And you just, it's a planning exercise.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.040]   You have to figure all that out
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.040]   and look at what your downside is.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.680]   And again, the hard part is on the premium side,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.080]   you just don't know what things are going to be
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.040]   in three or five years.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.080]   I mean, things could get a lot better
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.480]   or they could go back to having no system.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.400]   Who knows?
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.960]   It's such a political football.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:32.880]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.760]   Yeah, my name's Mike.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.040]   I just, first of all, thank you to you, Chris
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.240]   and Rick and Dr. Dolly and everybody that's here.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.040]   I feel like I've kind of found my tribe here, right?
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.240]   So I guess my question is more of a general one
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:49.440]   of how do you approach your lifestyle
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.120]   with folks that you interact with day-to-day
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.360]   as far as kids, friends, parents,
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.000]   and approaching the glide path to retirement
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.600]   and how did you approach that professionally
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.760]   with your peers?
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.960]   And then maybe more generally,
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.840]   how do you pay it forward with the folks
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.880]   that you come into contact with?
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.160]   - I'm trying to think of these questions one at a time.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.200]   So I'll start with the last 'cause I remember that.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.040]   As far as paying it forward, I mean, just being here,
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.440]   being a part of this conference, I really respect
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.480]   what the BOGO heads do and I was beyond honored
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.000]   and excited when they asked me to come speak
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.920]   and I was happy to do that.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.800]   Writing my blog, again, I do monetize it now,
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.760]   but I wrote for five years and didn't make a penny on it.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.900]   It's not like a big money maker.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.620]   It's more to offset our costs.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.840]   So just trying to put good information out there.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.360]   And like I said, I just, out of curiosity,
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.580]   I went and decided to go down the CFP route
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.660]   to educate myself just to make sure that,
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.480]   you know, what don't I know and to better be able
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.720]   to educate and help other people.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.800]   So that's that question and then I think you asked
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.440]   about like just in our life, interacting with people.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:52.120]   I'm open, like I don't like, if people ask what I do,
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.560]   I kind of say I'm like semi-retired.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.640]   I say, am I write a blog?
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.940]   Or most people don't really care to be honest.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.920]   As far as my child, I guess I'm a little bit like,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.760]   I'm a little bit worried like, are we going to spoil her?
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.540]   Is she gonna not have the work ethic we have?
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.060]   I mean, I think every parent has that though.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.540]   I mean, I don't know how you know the right balance
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.160]   and you just do the best you can.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.200]   And then as far as like her friends and stuff,
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.600]   I mean, I think again, like with my wife and I,
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.580]   like I think more is caught than taught.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.440]   So like when I look at the stuff we did well
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.520]   and I look at the stuff we did poorly,
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.780]   most of that came from our parents,
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.380]   but not 'cause they told us to do anything
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.220]   or not to do anything.
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.840]   Mostly just we watched and saw what they were doing
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.560]   and I think that's how kids mostly learn.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.280]   So we try to set a good example with how we are stewards
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.040]   of our money and how we spend
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.840]   and we do have occasional conversations,
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.960]   but she's 10 and she doesn't really wanna get too involved
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.860]   in getting too deep in the weeds there.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:49.520]   - Okay, so one of the biggest expenses was housing
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.520]   on your list. - Yes, yes.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.200]   - And the way you solved that problem
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.340]   was you liked to rock climb and you wanted a better,
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.200]   you didn't want one of the long commutes,
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.560]   you wanted a quality of life.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   So you moved from Pennsylvania to Utah.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.840]   Did your parents follow you there?
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.000]   How did the grandparents
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.240]   and your kid's situation resolve itself?
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.800]   - That is a great question and a tough question
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.120]   'cause that's, my parents, that's their only granddaughter.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.200]   And so it was a tough situation.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.520]   Again, this really isn't a financial,
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.360]   like we didn't, we moved to,
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.640]   where we moved is substantially more expensive
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.480]   than where we came from.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.320]   It was a low cost of living.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.960]   So it wasn't a, we weren't moving to save money.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.280]   We were moving for lifestyle
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.680]   and like the area we were at in Pennsylvania,
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.960]   I mean, if my family wasn't there, I would never live there.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.840]   I was there because of my family.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.800]   And also just as a place to raise a kid,
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.880]   I mean, it's a depressed area.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.600]   There's just not a ton of opportunities.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.000]   And also Pennsylvania,
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.720]   like the education costs are extremely high.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.980]   So there was a lot of reasons
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.720]   that kind of factored into her quality of life,
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.200]   but that was definitely a tough thing.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.040]   And we built that into our lifestyle,
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.440]   both in our budget to travel.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.780]   We typically go back, we were back there this summer,
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.640]   we're gonna go back for Thanksgiving.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.060]   My parents, we have a house with like a mother-in-law suite.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.020]   So my mom's been pretty sick
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.540]   and unable to travel ever since COVID.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.940]   But prior to that, they would come out
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.500]   and spend three, four weeks at a time with us
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.620]   to be around my daughter, their granddaughter.
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.580]   So, but yeah, I mean, those are always tough things
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.660]   and it's really not a financial question.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.620]   And so I think you have to navigate that on your own.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   - I can answer that.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:28.020]   So I've got three kids and eight grandkids
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.980]   and go where you want to go.
[00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:32.940]   Parents want you to be successful.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.880]   Go where you need to go.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.860]   If the parents follow, they chase their kids,
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:38.980]   then that's what they do.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.060]   If they don't, they don't.
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:42.380]   But don't let that be a factor in what you do.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.500]   Thank you, Chris, it's been wonderful.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:46.340]   - Thank you.
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.700]   (audience applauding)
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.780]   - And right outside we have lunch
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.340]   and then we'll be back in here
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.660]   in a little less than one hour.
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:58.580]   Enjoy your lunch.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.520]   (computer beeping)
