[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well, we close out the Pastors Conference today, Wednesday, downtown at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   And this conference has proven to be a valuable platform for us to gather and to talk about and think about
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   what it means to live and minister in a post-Christian culture that seems to grow more and more openly hostile
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   to the Gospel and more and more intolerant of Christian views.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   On this final day, we will hear from missionary Tim Kazee.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I'm grateful for his dispatches from the front DVDs.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I know many of you have seen those. If you haven't, you should check them out.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And I cannot wait for his message this morning.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And then the conference ends with a speaker panel with John Piper, Jason Meyer, Leont Krump, and Kazee.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Be sure to follow the Wednesday morning schedule and watch the live stream at DesiringGod.org/live.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Today on the podcast, we look at a dynamic of sin that's very important.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Sin is kinetic. It is emotional. It moves and changes us in fundamental ways, as we will see.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   But more importantly, we must understand that joy, glorified joy that is unspeakably great, is also kinetic.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It also changes us.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   So where do we get such a joy, and how is that joy contrasted with the sorrows of this world?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Here's a clip from a recent John Piper sermon to explain.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   The question is simply, so how does that connect to glory?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Because you're saying there's a connection between joy that is glory-fed and sorrow or grief that is gloom-fed.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So where are you seeing that in 1 Peter?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And that comes now as we drop down to verse 8.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   "Though you have not seen Him," Jesus.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Isn't it interesting? This is written in the first century to people in Asia, Cappadocia, Bithynia,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   who've never ever seen Jesus just like you.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So it was already in the first century. He's gone back to heaven, and now the challenge is faced.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   People are getting converted to a person they cannot see.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   "Though you have not seen Him, you love Him.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Though you do not now see Him, you believe in Him and rejoice," here it comes,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   "rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory."
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   What does that mean?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The literal translation would be, "You rejoice in Him with inexpressible."
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   You can't put it into words.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   We feel that so often with genuine, authentic, deep emotions.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Emotion and language are not of the same thing.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So to translate one to the other, stuff gets lost.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You feel profound love for somebody, and you're trying to say it,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and just, "That's totally inadequate, what I just said."
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Or you feel a grief, and somebody says, "What's wrong?"
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And you can't, there's no words. Words won't work.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   That's what it means when it says, "inexpressible."
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   This is a joy that is inexpressible, and then comes the key phrase,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   literally, "glorified."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   What does it mean to call Christian joy in Jesus glorified?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Glorified joy.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Now, I mean, maybe you've heard other portions of the New Testament
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   that say, "If we suffer with Him, we shall be glorified with Him,"
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Romans 8, 17.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So someday, Christ is coming back, and we're going to be so caught up
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   into His glorious person that we get changed.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   All our sins go away, we get a new body, we're going to shine like the sun
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   in the kingdom of our Father. I get that. I get glorified that way.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But what's this? This is like right now, in a not-yet-saved world,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   while I'm being grieved by various trials, verse 6,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I rejoice in Him with glorified, inexpressible joy? What's that?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And I think you know what that is by analogy.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   When you are thrilled with something or someone,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   that thing shapes the joy, shapes the person having the joy,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   which is why having joy in sin is so awful, because it makes you like it.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It makes you like it.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So if you are totally given over to raunchy pornography,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   you will become a raunchy person, and your joy will be so defiled
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and so contaminated, you can hardly look on anything beautiful anymore
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and feel a pure joy, a glorified joy.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But if you are taken up with beautiful things, this is just analogy,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   just pick what makes you happy in this world right now for the analogy.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   The most beautiful thing you can think of, the most righteous and good
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   and holy thing that makes you happy, if you dwell on that and you linger on that
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   and you rejoice in it, you become like that. You do.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   You become a sweeter, kinder, more holy, more beautiful, more wonderful person
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   because all of your heart is going into that beautiful thing,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and it's coming into you, and it's shaping your joy.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So my understanding of what that means when it says glorified joy now
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   is that as you focus on the glory of Christ, the beauty of Christ,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   the wonder of Christ, and all that He's done in the gospel,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   your joy becomes like that. It's a glorified joy.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It participates in, it gets shaped by that.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And one of the reasons I feel confirmed in that understanding
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   is because of what Jesus said about His own joy.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   This is John 15, 11.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   "These things I have spoken to you, that my joy,"
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   this is Jesus talking, "that my joy may be in you,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   and your joy may be full."
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Now, is that a different joy than 1 Peter 1.8? I doubt it.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   1 Peter 1.8, it's called a glorified joy, and Jesus says,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   "I'm going to give you my joy."
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And Jesus' joy is primarily in the Father, and in the glory of the Father.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   His bread is to do the will of the Father, and therefore,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   as we rejoice in Jesus, Jesus' joy becomes our joy.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   His joy shapes our joy.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You may be sitting there right now feeling like,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   "This emotional talk about joy is just so far different
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   from anything I've experienced.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I doubt that I'll ever be able to get in there."
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Don't believe that.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   That's not God talking in your head.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   That's Satan talking.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   You can't have that.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You've been too low, too dirty.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   My joys are just grungy joys, and so I won't ever be able to go there
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   where he's talking about.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   That's not true, and the reason it's not true is because Jesus does the miracle.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You start focusing on Jesus and the gospel, something happens in here.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   You don't have any control over it.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You don't.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   He's taken over.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   He's going to make you able to be happy in things a year ago
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   you never thought you could ever be happy with.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Yes, he will.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   So my first answer to the question, "How in the world can sorrowful
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   yet always rejoicing be, how can this joy be so durable that it survives
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   all the sorrow?" is that it is a joy that is in the glory of Christ
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   or the glory of God, and is being shaped by that glory, made by that glory,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and participating in that glory, and is therefore unshakable
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   because the glory of God is the most glorious, powerful, durable,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   beautiful, lasting reality in the universe.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Amen. Yes, treasure that truth and memorize 1 Peter 1.8
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and tattoo it to your forearm if you need to.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   This clip was from John Piper's sermon on December 29, 2015,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   titled "One Passion," and delivered at the Campus Outreach 2015
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   New Year's Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   You can find the full message, of course, on our site.

[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Well, if we have the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives in Christ,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   which we do, do we really need Bible teachers and preachers
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   to help us understand the Bible itself?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   This is a perennial question we get all the time, and it's a question
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I will serve up to John Piper tomorrow when he returns to join us.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   [Silence]
