[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   I'm out here, man, middle of Manhattan, walking around.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.660]   I'm actually going to a AP store today, get my first, get my first AP.
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.020]   I got a bunch of rollies, but I ain't got no AP, so I'm about to go cut my first one.
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.660]   It's pretty exciting.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960]   Got grape in the cut.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.180]   Man, let me see that backpack, man.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.740]   Who copped that for you?
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.060]   Limited edition from Mr. Grape himself.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.520]   Limited edition.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.280]   I think we got that.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.840]   Where were we at?
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.280]   Aspen?
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.800]   Aspen.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.520]   101.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.080]   That joint hard.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.660]   And you got the grapes on there.
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.060]   We at the AP store, man.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.080]   This is a stepping stone.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.800]   I got all these rollies, no AP.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.700]   First AP, man, my girl Natalie, the goat.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.000]   Man, came in.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.060]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.720]   Man, first AP, this is a big deal.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.920]   This is a big deal.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.380]   This is a big day for me.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.460]   Been one of these since I got in the league.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.040]   Now I'm capping.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.540]   I just got into watches a year ago.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.320]   But I'm excited to get my first AP, for sure.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.680]   Man, I don't got too much to say.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.700]   Speak for itself.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.660]   It's been a good day, y'all.
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.900]   Just walking around NYC for the first time.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.180]   I think we're in Midtown.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.280]   I think that's what they said.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.780]   Doing a little shopping.
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.040]   Got a good cop today.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.760]   You want a picture?
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.100]   If you say your name for my vlog.
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.980]   What's your name?
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.420]   Melissa.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.620]   Melissa, yes.
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.280]   You can get a picture.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.160]   What's up?
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.220]   Got the personal shopper with us.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.920]   Hey, Andrew, can you introduce yourself real quick?
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.460]   What's up, man?
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.240]   My name is Jeff.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.700]   Okay.
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.500]   I work at Saks.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.400]   I got MPJ.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.980]   First time in Brooklyn.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.360]   We're going to show you how Brooklyn gets down.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.860]   Yes, sir, man.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.200]   And those are some drippy white boys right there.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.560]   Got Grape on the left.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.160]   Nick on the right.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   Hey, Grape.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.660]   What'd you cop today, boy?
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.640]   A little bit of Louie.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.880]   A little bit of Balenci.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.700]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.260]   Hey, Nick.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.500]   What'd you cop today, fam?
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200]   Got a little Louie crossbody.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.000]   Louie kicks.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.660]   Louie shirt.
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.460]   Balenci shirt.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.360]   Just something slight.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.680]   Man, I see a homeless dude over there.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.400]   I've seen him eating out the trash.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.240]   If I got cash on me, I'm always going to try to help out a brother like that.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:44.320]   You don't want no cash, sir?
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:55.340]   Okay, I guess not.
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.320]   I guess not.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.520]   It's really sad.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.180]   It's sad because, like, we've seen him reaching in the trash can and getting the peanut butter and jelly.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.180]   That's tough, bro.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.540]   I feel bad for him.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.780]   It's sad, for real.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.100]   Fight for that, man.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:26.920]   I'm a creative director, dog.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.420]   There you go.
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.840]   Go ahead.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.460]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.540]   Because you got to see.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.520]   I got to check out your brand, dude.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:04:00.120]   I had to pull up to this spot for brunch.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.260]   Mason Clothes right here in Soho.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.740]   It's a nice truffle pasta.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.860]   What's crazy is I grew up vegetarian, so I didn't even eat steak.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.260]   I probably started eating steak like a year or two ago.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.360]   So I'm going to taste it, pause, and see what it's talking about.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.460]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.720]   Cipriani right over there.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.260]   My dude, thank you.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.940]   Appreciate it.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.300]   Yes, sir.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.280]   Thank you.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.840]   That's fun, dude.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.700]   Pulled up to Bottega.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.400]   Trying on a few different bags, not purses.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.440]   Man, I want to get the people's opinion on this.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.820]   We in here shopping for some little bags, but do y'all think these are purses?
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.100]   Or do y'all think these are some swag?
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.900]   Let me see what you got on right now.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.900]   Just a little Louis crossbody right here.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.200]   Yeah, a little Louis crossbody.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.220]   We ain't here in Bottega looking for some little bags.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.180]   What y'all think about this, man?
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.720]   This is just right here.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.940]   There's like two of these in the world, man.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.020]   Let me know what y'all think.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.380]   People, where y'all be at?
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.380]   Come support y'all.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.060]   What's the cause, bruh?
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.540]   I'm going to save money and stay out of trouble.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.720]   Are y'all capped or y'all for real?
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.420]   For real.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.240]   Man, you lying.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.160]   I'm going to go.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.520]   All right, Yvette, what y'all be charging for them joints?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.820]   Anything you want to kill.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.780]   But $20 is my lucky number or $100 is my dream.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.820]   I want some roll-ups, some fruit snacks.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.660]   What's that, some drip?
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.920]   Yeah, I got drip.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.640]   What's it called?
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.980]   Basically, my brand is some bracer roots.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.000]   That's the theme of my brand.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.260]   Celebration of roots?
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.960]   Yeah, eight-wing bracer roots.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.100]   Let me see them joints.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.680]   Yeah, these are the shirts.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   Come on.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.200]   Damn.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:05.540]   Oh, my God.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.020]   We about to get a chop right now for my boy EZ Tel Aviv Cut.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.700]   Say what up.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.420]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.740]   We're here bringing my boy to life.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.640]   Yes, sir.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.000]   It was a little before video.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.740]   He about to get me right, so.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.680]   Stay tuned.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.740]   How long have you been cutting for, bro?
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.560]   I've been cutting over 10 years.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.640]   I've been really taking it serious, probably.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.980]   What year did Tay don't come in?
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.780]   Around 18, 18, 18, 2018, 17, 18.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.580]   The thing is, with cutting hair, with all the different hair textures, you can never be precise.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.960]   Yeah, my hair is different.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.360]   I got different calyx.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.180]   So, some barbers, they don't get me right.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.460]   What's your podcast about?
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.540]   Honestly, bro, I just interviewed, I interviewed different people, you know.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.800]   A lot of athletes, when they have podcasts, they only interview athletes.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.220]   Right.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.080]   And for me, like, I'm trying to touch every lane of life, so.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.120]   Get a perspective of.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.920]   Get perspectives of things I'm interested in.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.180]   So, like, it's called Curious Mike.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.160]   And basically, whatever I'm curious about, I'm curious about a lot more than just.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.980]   Than just ball.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.780]   Than just basketball.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:27.260]   So, I'm interviewing, like, bro, I had, like, an ex-FBI agent on there who worked all the
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.840]   undercover cases that he couldn't talk about.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.700]   I had a porn star on there to talk about how she got into that.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.920]   I had a girl on there who got, um, who had got trafficked one time.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.960]   And it was a human trafficking survivor.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   Oh, I get it.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.220]   I'm trying to, I've had, like, pastors on there talking about different things.
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.220]   I'm just trying to touch every lane of life and things that I'm interested in, so.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.280]   Yeah, because, you know, it's a rare thing for an athlete to do.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.960]   You know, a lot of people don't see athletes interview anyone outside of that.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.860]   Of what they're doing.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.300]   Exactly.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.800]   Exactly.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:08.080]   And honestly, what happened was, I felt like on Twitter or, like, Instagram or as an athlete,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.000]   like, if you, people, things get taken out of context.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.500]   So, what happened to me was a couple things came out that kind of got taken out of context.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.540]   I tweet, I used to be on Twitter, like, if you tweet something, people can perceive it
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.360]   any way they want.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.760]   And so, I came up with the idea of having a podcast to where, like, if people really want
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.260]   to see what you're about and what you're talking about, go watch the full form of the podcast.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:30.740]   Don't tell me.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.980]   Even though they still take little clips and they, they, they edit it out, you know.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.400]   But still, like, if you, if you take the time to go watch the full thing, it's there for
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:39.900]   you to watch.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.940]   You don't be the person to tell my truth.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.960]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.980]   Right out of what the media does.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.920]   I definitely got misunderstood a couple times and that made me feel like, man, I'm off this
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.580]   Twitter thing.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.880]   I'm off the Instagram thing.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.660]   I want the long format, being able to talk about certain things.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.560]   And, like, open conversation, too.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.180]   Because I feel like, nowadays, everything is scripted.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:05.260]   Not only that, but if you have an opinion that differs from what society says is the right
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.060]   way of thinking about things, you're kind of canceled.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.440]   Man, so I wanted to open up a lane for, like, people to have an open, honest conversation.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:17.040]   And it's coming from a place of, like, humility and curiosity and not just, like, right, I know
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.340]   it all.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:17.800]   You feel me?

[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.080]   Shout out to my dude.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.760]   Say again, Easy Tel Aviv.

[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.260]   Got any last message for the people watching, man?
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.240]   Anything you want to say?
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.640]   I just want to say whatever it is that you're good at and you're doing it, stay consistent.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.880]   Someone will notice you.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.920]   You've been a long way, you know, cutting.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.780]   You feel me?
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.900]   Now he cut everybody.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.940]   Everybody in the business.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.120]   How's it going?
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.320]   No warm-up.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.860]   If I make...
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.720]   Hold on.

[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.300]   up in the buy-off.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:14.460]   If I make less than 7 out of 10, that mean I owe, like, 10 of y'all $100.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.220]   Now you do 100 push-ups.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.760]   How do you push-ups?
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.600]   How do you push-ups?
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.540]   On the camera?
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.500]   On the camera.

[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   Going to take care of my guy Nick over here.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   And we're about to go crazy.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   Let me put my camera away so I can really get busy.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   I got immunity and lack the continuity.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   I leave him in the dust and stack bread cause I'm moving things.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   Speed reached a new high when I started removing things.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   I had to drop the baggage out the plane before I flew a wing.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   I think they're fresh.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.960]   The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collection.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   I think they're fire.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.960]   Different.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   What you got?
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.960]   I know like what made them collab with Squid Game.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.960]   Puma got the most creative collabs.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   Oh.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   You know Donnie Namias.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   Shout out Donnie man.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.960]   It's all I rock.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   But he just did a collab with Puma.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   That's fire.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   He got the kicks with the Namias collab fire.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   There goes some of the mellows right there.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   Is it?
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   I ain't gonna lie.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   These look crazy.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   I just don't know if it's a little weird if I rock his kicks cause that's Lil bro.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   Shawn the man behind the camera.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.960]   Shawn the man behind the camera.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.960]   You like all the basic?
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   All the basic joints?
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   Simple guy man.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   Some little white shorts man.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.960]   You in here going crazy.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   Look at this big suede shoe right here.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.960]   And it's like actual real suede.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.960]   It's like a real shoe.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   Cause nobody gone tell it like it is.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   So I be showing them the way.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   Living by example put my life on display.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   What's up y'all.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.960]   Just got done at the Puma flagship store out here in Midtown.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   You know I got the weekend off so we had to do a little shopping.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   Definitely had to stop by Puma.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   Like I said I've been with Puma for 7-8 years now.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   So had to pull up.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.960]   As you can see we went crazy.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   My guys got right.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   I got right.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   So we good.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   Yes sir.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:08.960]   We out here at the Yankees game right now.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   It's my second baseball game I've ever been to.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   I went to one Rockies game back in Denver.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   But I had to come check out the Yankees.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   You know I've been rocking the Yankees ever since I was a JIT.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   So it's good to come check them boys out.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   They balling right now.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   You know what I mean.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.960]   We in the GM suite.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   I guess he's not here today.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   So they put us up here in the suite.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   Got a perfect view.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   We're out here kicking it.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.960]   Oh then he gotta go crazy.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   Bases loaded.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   The dude at the bat is the dude who plugged us with the tickets.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   Let's do it Jazz.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   Hey Nick you've been coming real drippy lately.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   Can we get a little fit check please.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.960]   Got me a little Louie Bay jeans.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   Louie ski board and shoes.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.960]   Got my Louie crossbody.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   Valenciaga cut off.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   Little rolly action.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   Just something slight.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   Just a calm little day.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   Hey can we please get a fit check sir.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   Bro.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   Free free free free.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:26.960]   This popcorn is elite.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   Two balls two strikes.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   I think it hit somebody in the head boo.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   Two outs, two strikes, three balls.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   It's a big play right here.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   Yeah so.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   2-2.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.960]   They don't have plays and stuff.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   So they don't have to like show up super early.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.960]   Do pre-game all that stuff do they?
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   I feel like they just.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   They gotta practice hitting.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   Practice fielding.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   Like they still do like their warm ups and stuff like that.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.960]   But they don't have.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   They actually are kind of.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   They play every day bro.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.960]   I feel like.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   I'm telling the culture.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   We're playing every day.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   Like I'm just pulling up to the game.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   We're on the main concourse with it now.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   I think they got a Benihana in here.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   So that's what I'm looking for.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.960]   Oh yeah this is what I was looking for.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   Right here.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   That Benihana.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   Michael Porter Jr.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.960]   What's up my guy?
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.960]   What's up?

[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   You like baseball or basketball more?
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   Basketball.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   Big Knicks guy.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   Let's go Knicks baby.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   All right.

[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   Wait Knicks?
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   I'm the shotgun.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   Oh.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.960]   Help us make Brooklyn great man.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   Yeah let's do it.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   Let's do it.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   Thank you so much man.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   We would be playing against the Knicks and you would have to wear a Nets shirt.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   What's the best part of New York?
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   The city.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   The city.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   The city.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   Probably the pizza in the city.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   The pizza?

[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   The Brooklyn Nets.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960]   I'm the Knicks fan.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   I'm the Knicks fan bro.

[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   Honestly.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   For the most part people are chill.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.960]   The stadium's fire.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   This is some real New York.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.960]   It's iconic.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   The stadium's iconic.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960]   So I'm enjoying it.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960]   You tall bro.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   You don't hoop.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.960]   Yeah I do.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.960]   I'm going to college.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   I'm going to college.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.960]   Yeah good luck next season.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.960]   It's Gordon.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.960]   I said it was pretty chill.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.960]   And then it got hectic.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   Yeah sure.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.960]   I'm 6'10".
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.960]   You're 5'1".
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.960]   I don't know how bro.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.960]   When I guess someone's height.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   It's the right height every single time.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960]   Weird to me.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   Is that that Sprite lemonade?
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   Oh good look bro.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   That's sad.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   Three fourths lemonade.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   Thank me later.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.960]   Even at a baseball game.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   Discipline must remain out.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960]   So you don't do no T meals.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.960]   No T meals.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   I don't know how bro.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   I don't know how bro.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.960]   When I guess someone's height.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.960]   It's the right height every single time.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.960]   Weird to me.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   Is that that Sprite lemonade?
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   Oh good look bro.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   You feel me?
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.960]   Even at a baseball game.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   Discipline must remain out.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   So you don't do no T meals.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   Chicken, shrimp, avocado rolls, no sauce.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   Fit it with some of the ginger.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   Well.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   Who said well?
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   Can't say the same man.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   I got this chicken and fried rice bowl with the yum yum sauce.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   Why are you so healthy then?
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   Man.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.960]   You're not trying to get pudgy?
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.960]   At all.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   Man, where are y'all ranking the sporting events in terms of enjoyment and going to the games?
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   Where do y'all rank baseball?
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   For me, I think that basketball is definitely the most fun.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   I think hockey might be second.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   Then I'm going baseball, then football, then soccer.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   I think baseball is dope because you just get to chill at the game.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   You know, vibe.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960]   Eat good food.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.960]   Bring your friends to relax.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.960]   But it is kind of slow.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.960]   But it's been fun though.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   It's been a vibe.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.960]   The dudes outside the arena is trying to finesse us.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   Talking about 275 for a 30 minute drive.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.960]   So we had to rock with my boy right here.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   He's getting us for the 200.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   He's getting us for the low because this other dude tried to finesse.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.960]   I'm out here.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   I'm out here one week and people are always trying to finesse me.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.960]   The kids on the street charging $100 a shirt.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.960]   Shout out to them though.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.960]   Shout out to my guys.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   Super dope.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   You know, the fans showed love.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   The game was fire.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.960]   It was cool, man.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.960]   New York is definitely growing on me.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   After I've been moving around a little bit, seeing different sites, doing different things.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   So far it's been love.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   I'm happy to be here.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   And I'll definitely be going to more Yankees games because we came to the suite.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   They had the food laid out and everything.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   They had it all set up for us.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   It was dope, man.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.680]   It was dope, man.
