[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, Jesus, of course, delivered the Great Commission.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   "In it comes the command for all peoples of the earth to be reached with the good news."
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   But who was Jesus speaking to?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Is the Great Commission given to the original apostles only, or to the church at large,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   or to particular local churches, or to front-line missions, minded types,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   or is the Great Commission given to each and every Christian?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   That's the question from a listener named David.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   "Hi, Pastor John. A friend recently suggested to me that we should interpret the Great Commission as a command
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   to make disciples for the church at large, not as a command directed to every individual believer.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Do you think this command to reach the nations is better interpreted for apostles
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   and key church leaders and even whole local churches,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   or should we take this as a personal commission from Jesus given to every individual Christ follower?"
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Let's start by analyzing the questions themselves.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   So the first one is, should we interpret the Great Commission as a command for the church at large,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   not as a command directed to every individual believer?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Now what would that mean, to treat the Great Commission as a command for the "church at large"?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Wouldn't that leave the very same questions for individual believers as if the command were given directly to him?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I mean, since if you think the command is given to the church at large,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and you don't think the whole church at large is going to reach all the peoples,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   but only individuals in that church at large,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   those individuals are the ones who are going to actually touch the unreached peoples,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   then you have to decide, well, which individuals are going to do that in the church at large?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And that would fall on each individual with the same question as if the command were directed to him directly.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Does this mean going personally or supporting the cause through others going personally?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   So I don't think it really solves any practical issue at all to say that the command is directed to the church at large.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   That's my analysis of the first question.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Here's the next one.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Same clarification is needed when he asks, "Should we take this as a personal commission from Jesus given to every individual Christ follower?"
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Well, if we say yes, then we have to clarify by asking,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   "Well, do you mean that Jesus commands every single believer to be a missionary to the nations with the gospel
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and a focus on crossing cultures and reaching all the nations, which is in fact the focus of the Great Commission, not just local evangelism?"
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And the answer to that question from the Bible is clearly no.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He doesn't expect that or command that.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And one evidence for that is that Romans 15 is where Paul is recruiting people from Rome not to go with him to Spain,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   but to support him as he goes to Spain.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And he knows that all those people he's writing to in Rome, all those Christians where the gospel is already rooted,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   they have jobs and they have networks of relationship, and so he's not calling them,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   "Hey, now, all you serious Christians, everybody get on a boat and go with me to Spain."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   He's saying, "Support me as I go."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So it's clear from the New Testament that God does not expect every person to hear the Great Commission
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   and hear in it a summons to cross a culture and be a missionary.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I do think that 1 Peter 2:9 instructs all believers to declare the excellencies of Christ in their network of relationships.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who calls you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   But the New Testament does not teach that every believer should be a cross-cultural missionary of Christ,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   trying to penetrate unreached peoples as a frontier missionary.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So let's go back for just a moment to the Great Commission in Matthew 28.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Those words, "Go make disciples of all nations," are addressed to the 11 apostles.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   We see that in verse 16. It's the 11 who are gathered.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   But the clue that Jesus intends for the command not just to be for the 11, but to some group outliving the 11?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   The clue is at the end of verse 20, where the warrant, the ground, the support for the command is the promise,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   "Behold, I am with you," and then He tells how long this warrant is going to last.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   "To the end of the age."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So the task will last as long as God promises to help it last, namely,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   "I'm going to be with you in this task to the end of the age."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So the question is—and every generation of believer has to ask this—
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   the question is, "Who picks up the mantle in the following centuries?"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And it's not enough to say, "Either every individual does, or the whole church does."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It's not enough, because neither of those answers helps decide, "Well, who's going to do it?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Who's going to actually get off their rear end and risk their life penetrating the remaining unreached peoples of the world?"
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   That's the critical issue.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Every individual doesn't do it, and the church as a whole doesn't do it.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Specific human beings do it, hopefully supported by every individual and supported by the whole church,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   but it's individual people that take the gospel cross-cultures to other people.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Where do they come from?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Who are they?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   How do they come into being?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   How do they get authorized, gifted, equipped, sustained?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Now here's my biblical pointer toward an answer.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Jesus said in John 10, 15, and 16, "I lay down my life for the sheep, and I have other sheep that are not of this fold.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I must bring them also.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   They will listen to my voice, so there will be one flock and one shepherd."
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   In other words, Jesus shed his blood—"I lay down my life for the sheep"—
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Jesus shed his blood to gather his sheep from other folds besides this Jewish fold.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   According to John 11, 52, these sheep are scattered all over the world, and they are to be gathered in.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   He laid down his life to gather them in.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And then he says, "They will listen to my voice."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   How will they listen to his voice?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   They will hear his voice through human voices that make known the truth of Jesus.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   So Jesus prayed in John 17, 20, "I do not ask for these only, but for all those who will believe in me through their word."
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Now, wherever the word of the apostles—through their word—wherever the word of the apostles is echoed in the mouth of emissaries of Jesus, people come to faith.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So the answer to the question, "How will the nations and peoples be reached?" is by means of believers opening their mouths
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and telling the good news deposited by the apostles in the New Testament concerning the gospel of Jesus.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And who are those cross-cultural emissaries? Who are they?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And I'll just say briefly, in closing, for 33 years in pastoral ministry, carrying this burden and raising this question
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and living with this reality of unreached peoples all over the world while I sit and work here in Minneapolis,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   for 33 years it was an absolute wonder and glory and beauty to watch God appoint from among his children
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   those who felt a relentless, irresistible, biblically informed, spiritually mature, church-based, miraculous calling on their lives
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   to get themselves to a cross-cultural frontier for Christ's sake.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   So my answer is that the Great Commission is to be loved and supported and advocated for by all who love what Jesus loves.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   How can you not?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And that among these, in churches where the gospel is preached and the burden of missions is lifted up,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   God mysteriously and miraculously, wonderfully calls his frontier emissaries.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you for listening and continuing to support this podcast

[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Well, one reason parenting is such daunting work is because of the balance required of us parents.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   We don't want to be too strict or too lenient.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   We don't want to be too consequence-driven and not so gracious as to overlook rebellion.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Into this balancing act comes a question from a young mom who wants to be kind and who expects to be obeyed.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And that's the question on the table when we return on Wednesday.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
