[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.460]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.140]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.940]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.100]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.540]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.380]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.820]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.980]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.020]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.180]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.540]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.340]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.780]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.740]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.580]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.620]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.900]   Well, listeners, I'm super glad to have you today.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.060]   I have, as I have looked outside at this gorgeous fall day,
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.620]   I've thought how much fun it would be
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.820]   to be outside and explore a little nature,
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.840]   take a walk, play in the yard.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.700]   And it made me remember
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.060]   one of my daughter's favorite birthday parties, okay?
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.660]   My older daughter never had a quote-unquote
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.300]   normal birthday party that you could go to the store
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.140]   and buy the plates and cups and party hats
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.220]   all in the matching theme.
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.300]   She never picked a normal theme.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.220]   And so for her 12th birthday,
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.700]   she said that she wanted to have a treasure hunt party.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.980]   Yep, a treasure hunt party.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.100]   And she's quite a bit older
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.620]   than some of your kids probably are,
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.940]   so that was a long time ago.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.580]   And there weren't as many factory-made things back then,
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.460]   but my husband and I had a great delight
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.860]   in creating all this stuff.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.820]   And we made poems,
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.740]   we made couplet clues for all of the places,
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.540]   and we burned the edges
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.660]   so they looked like ancient treasure maps.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.700]   And we had a gaggle of 12-year-old girls
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.060]   running all over our property,
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.100]   looking under logs and behind bushes
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.380]   and underneath old pieces of timber
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.700]   and in hollow knots in the trees for all of these clues.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.060]   And I think, as I look back,
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.620]   it was one of the birthday parties
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.300]   that they seemed to enjoy the most.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.420]   And today, we are gonna talk about treasure,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.220]   although not a birthday treasure hunt.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.500]   We're gonna talk about the treasure
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.260]   that a classical education can be.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.500]   Yep, the treasure of a classical education.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.340]   And I've got one of my favorite podcast people,
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.740]   one of my best friends, through the years,
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.980]   as we have pursued classical education
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.140]   with our families together.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.060]   I have with me today, Jennifer Courtney.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.780]   Jennifer, thank you so much for being with us.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.060]   - Oh, thanks for having me, Lisa.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.940]   I always love being here with you.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.820]   - I love it when we get to share about our families
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.820]   and we get to share about classical education.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.140]   Let me ask you this.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.260]   What, to you, is the best part of a treasure hunt?
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.940]   - Well, as always, I love your stories
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.620]   and I love your birthday party story.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.940]   And I was asking, what a perfect fit for these ideas
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.340]   that we've been talking about
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.460]   with classical Christian education.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.980]   And it's really fun to think about God Himself
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.980]   hiding these treasures for us to find
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.180]   as we study both His Word and His world together.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.940]   And I think that He probably delights in doing that
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.860]   as much as you and David delight in hiding things.
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.700]   - I bet so.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.980]   Yeah, yeah, I loved it.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.260]   And, you know, we got a charge
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.020]   out of looking through the sliding glass door,
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.540]   watching these girls.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.020]   I mean, they're 12 years old.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.300]   These are almost teenagers running around the yard
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.300]   and finding a clue and unearthing it from the coffee can
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.260]   and pulling it out and reading it
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.900]   and arguing about what does it mean
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.700]   and where is it leading and watching them run around.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.780]   They had the best time deciphering the clues
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.980]   and wrestling out what,
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.180]   well, your parents wouldn't do that.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.140]   Oh, yes, they would.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.380]   Where do you think it could be?
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.220]   We're not gonna climb that tree, are we?
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.260]   Yes, we are.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.580]   Going through all of that.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.580]   So to us, watching the journey was a lot of fun.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.820]   But you know what I discovered at the end
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.300]   and afterwards when we asked them
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.220]   if they had had a good time,
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.620]   what they enjoyed the most was the finding of the treasure.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.060]   'Cause honestly, y'all, I had made a treasure box.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.900]   So there was a wooden treasure box that was buried.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.580]   Yep, buried in the yard.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.860]   But when they opened it up,
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.220]   I mean, it was tacky Mardi Gras necklaces
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.260]   and fake plastic rock rings
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.780]   and Hershey bar gold nuggets.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.820]   And so it was not a big treasure.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.260]   And they enjoyed the chocolate
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.540]   and they wore all the necklaces.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.660]   But what they really loved the most was the journey,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.220]   was the finding of the treasure
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.300]   and the wrestling through the clues together.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.900]   And so we're gonna come back to that.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.340]   I want, you guys, I want,
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.420]   Jennifer has written an amazing article
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.180]   that is gonna be linked in the show notes of this episode
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.100]   about something that sounds complicated,
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.940]   but is actually very simply beautiful.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.460]   It's about the catechesis wheel.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.820]   And this is the first,
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.660]   this is the beginning.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.420]   I wanna read it 'cause I loved this quote, Jennifer.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.500]   You did such a great job of wetting our interest.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.860]   What if we viewed education
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.380]   as a giant treasure hunt through God's universe?
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.500]   What if we looked for all the ways
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.700]   that our academic subjects add
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.100]   to our knowledge of God's attributes?
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.660]   What if we viewed the twin goals of education
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.660]   as falling down in worship and rising up in service?
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.940]   I love that.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.460]   That's very eloquent, my friend, very eloquent.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.980]   How is education at its best
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.740]   supposed to be a treasure hunt?
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.460]   - Yeah, well, I think that we have this lifetime
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.060]   that God has given us to learn about who He is.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.700]   And I always like to think about the three short years
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.540]   that the disciples had with Him
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.100]   and how He was constantly trying to teach them who He was.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.980]   And He used the people around Him
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.820]   and the object lessons
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.940]   that they would recognize from everyday life.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.940]   And we have a little bit longer than three years, thankfully.
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.780]   And we also have the opportunity to look for Him
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.380]   in chemistry, in geometry, in Latin,
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.940]   in biology, in history, in literature.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.260]   And so that to me is what turned my life,
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.300]   I think, upside down.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.780]   And you and I, years and years ago,
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.660]   used to talk about this idea at practicum.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.340]   But the first thing,
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.420]   the first idea that's important in this treasure hunt
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.020]   is that God is at the center of education
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.580]   and not us as the students
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.060]   that we're focused in on Him
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.380]   and learning more about who He is.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.980]   - Yes, yes, that is great.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.980]   Okay, y'all, we see the catechesis wheel at practicum
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.780]   and we see the catechesis wheel in the catalog.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.300]   If you don't know what I'm talking about,
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.740]   you will see a picture of it
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.860]   when you click on the link to Jennifer's blog.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.860]   But if you have access to a catalog, it's on page eight.
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.420]   So if you go to the catalog,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.300]   you will find the picture of the catechesis wheel
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.660]   on page eight.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.180]   So Jennifer, you told us already
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.780]   what you think the key component is,
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.780]   what is worth noticing first.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.500]   Reiterate that for us.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.660]   When we look at that catechesis wheel,
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.140]   what do you want people to see first?
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.900]   - Well, I think our eyes are naturally always drawn
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.100]   to the center of an image.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.500]   And that's good because here at the center,
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.900]   not just of our catechesis wheel,
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.860]   but of the universe itself is God.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.020]   And it's our job for all of our studies
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.740]   to be looking for Him
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.340]   and how He is the author
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.220]   of all the things that we're learning.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.140]   I love that, that God is the author.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.500]   So it's not the textbook writer,
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.180]   it's not the scope and sequence creator.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.540]   God is the author of all of that.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.420]   And I love it that the catechesis wheel diagram
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.060]   makes that really easy for us.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.060]   It's like the bullseye.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.060]   God is the bullseye.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.460]   That's what we are aiming for
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.580]   when we focus our energy on this.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.980]   - So talk to us a little bit about,
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.140]   I mean, 'cause this is very different.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.140]   The education that most of us still received,
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.300]   we're changing that, okay?
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.900]   And when I started,
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.900]   when you started with Classical Conversations 20 years ago,
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.980]   there were way fewer classically educated
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.980]   Christian homeschoolers.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.100]   But now we've got kids
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.500]   who are tutoring their own kids in foundations,
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.660]   and it's beautiful.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.100]   But still, for most of us,
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.660]   this diagram represents an education
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.340]   that's very different from what we had.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.340]   So can you compare modern education
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.540]   to this catechesis view of education?
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.460]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.340]   So the first thing would be that center again, right?
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.020]   So God is not at the center of a modern education.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.540]   The student is.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.540]   And around the student are an array of subjects
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.260]   that they get to choose from.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.660]   But the whole focus usually is preparing the student
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.180]   to get into a good college so that they can get a good job.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.580]   And so everything is focused on the student and not on God.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.820]   And then on top of that,
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.140]   if you are looking at the diagram of the catechesis wheel,
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.460]   not only is God in the center and the subjects are around,
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.940]   but those subjects are connected to one another.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.180]   And in a modern education,
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.580]   most of us went to a school
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.020]   where for 55 minutes, we studied math.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.700]   And then we went to a different teacher,
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.220]   and for 55 minutes, we studied English literature.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.860]   And then we went to another teacher,
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.380]   and for 55 minutes, we studied some branch of science.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.820]   And that process itself made it very hard for us to connect
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.380]   those fields of knowledge to one another.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.060]   - Yeah, it was not natural.
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.060]   I had very few history professors that talked about science
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.100]   and very few literature professors
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.380]   or teachers in high school who talked about
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.540]   what was going on in the world
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.540]   while this author was penning this novel.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:01.540]   Or even if a novel was about a time period,
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.860]   we never really delved into
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.460]   what was that period of in history like
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.260]   and how does this novel give us an accurate
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.460]   or an inaccurate picture of it.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.860]   There was really not a lot of connections made.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.700]   - Yeah, and I remember when I first heard about this thought
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.020]   of all of knowledge being integrated,
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.740]   I felt this weight of pressure.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.940]   Oh gosh, I have to integrate all of this
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.500]   for my children at home and for my students and community.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.020]   I'm a little bit slow apparently.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.540]   It took me a while to realize
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.140]   God had already connected all the things
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.780]   and that we were in a process
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.140]   of uncovering those connections, not creating them.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.700]   And in fact, I think I was telling you the other day,
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.940]   last year I had a student who was kind of excited
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.940]   that he knew I worked on the CC curriculum.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.460]   And so he was always excited about being in community
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.380]   where we were putting into practice the things
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.500]   that my team had worked on.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.620]   And he said, "We had a great day of integration one day."
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.780]   And he goes, "Wow, it's almost like
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.180]   you planned for this to happen."
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.140]   And I said, "Oh, you don't need to give me
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.260]   that kind of credit."
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.060]   It's almost like this happened
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.020]   because God has placed us in a universe
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.500]   where things are connected.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.820]   And we have gotten the delight of discovering that today.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.700]   - That is the coolest.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.860]   That is really cool.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.860]   So I know that years ago and still at practicums,
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:36.540]   we practiced talking about some of the connections.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.100]   Like how, like if you are looking at the catechesis wheel,
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.980]   as you said, all of the subjects are connected
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.260]   to God in the center as He's the author
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:53.020]   of all of the curriculum, which is the world.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.660]   And all of those subjects point back to Him
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.660]   and will tell us something about who God is
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.340]   and what He has been up to through all history.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.300]   But there are also, like you said,
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.500]   arrows that connect each subject.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.780]   So I'm gonna put you on the spot
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.020]   because I know that's really hard to do.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.740]   And because you're really, really practiced at this,
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.740]   make a connection for us between one of those
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:28.740]   in modern education, cloistered subjects and another one.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.380]   - Okay.
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.820]   Yeah, I'll give an example of my...
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.940]   And this example is very near and dear to my heart
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.700]   because it came from my own quietest child at home.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.540]   And so I tried to pay attention,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.260]   especially those last few years at home,
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.940]   I tried to pay attention to the things that she said
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.100]   and offered up because they were fewer
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.100]   and farther between than some of her siblings.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.260]   And so I had her in my challenge three community
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.340]   and I had asked them to bring a word
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.100]   from the gospel of John in Latin that caught their attention
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.300]   or caused them to see a scripture in a different way.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.900]   And she was the first one to respond that day,
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.700]   which was extremely unusual.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.660]   And she said, "Well, I was surprised
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.980]   "to find the word ratio in scripture."
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.380]   And so we talked about how it probably was pronounced
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.260]   ratio in Latin.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.980]   And so we looked it up in our dictionaries
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.220]   and discovered that it's a third declension noun,
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.380]   meaning reason.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.540]   And the Holy Spirit descended on our class that day.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.020]   And we looked at ratios in math.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:44.580]   And then of course we looked at ratios in chemistry.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.980]   - Yes, yes.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.420]   - Hard not to do that.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.860]   And then we looked at the relationships
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.180]   or ratios between notes in our music theory.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.580]   And then we talked about how that word also
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.580]   is the root of reason as in man's ability to reason.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.220]   And so lo and behold, we saw in Shakespeare's "Hamlet"
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.220]   that he describes man as being noble in reason.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.860]   - Oh, yes.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.820]   - And then we talked about how we were comparing
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.300]   the French Revolution and the American Revolution.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.740]   And we were talking about how during the French Revolution,
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.300]   they took down the religious statues in the cathedrals
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.820]   and they put up statues to the goddess of reason.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.420]   And by the way, that did not go well for them
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.540]   to either to disconnect reason and faith
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.540]   or to elevate reason over faith.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.060]   And so it just was a day when the Holy Spirit descended
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.460]   and we got to see that one idea,
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.740]   that one word that I wrote on the board
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.180]   to honor the contribution of my quiet girl.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.500]   And then we got to see it all day long in every subject.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.660]   - That is so cool.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.660]   So you basically had an all day,
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.500]   conversation about this one idea.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.700]   That is perfect because I wanted to ask you,
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.580]   what does catechesis even mean?
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.220]   We talk about that wheel.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.580]   And you know, I remember when we first started sharing
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.460]   about this in practicum years ago,
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.620]   that was a weird word for most people.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.740]   We didn't really know, why are we talking about this?
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.020]   And why are you putting this education stuff
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.380]   you want me to understand in words that I do not relate to?
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:36.580]   But something that your story just reminded me
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.380]   about the meaning of catechesis.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.900]   So share us, what does catechesis mean?
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.460]   - So it's a Greek word
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.060]   and normally we associate it with church instruction.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.220]   So a lot of people are familiar with catechism classes
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.340]   in different faith traditions.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.100]   And you have a teacher who asks a question
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.780]   and the student responds with a memorized response.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.740]   And the whole goal of that is to prepare the student
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.140]   for membership in the church.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:11.020]   So they are memorizing points of doctrine
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.740]   and the instructor is making sure that they do that well.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.700]   And a lot of times they're doing that together.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.260]   So if you think about responsive reading in church,
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.980]   the pastor might read a line
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.260]   and then the congregation reads some lines back together.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:31.260]   So I have lately been thinking of a few ways
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.020]   this applies to what we're doing in classical education.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.780]   One that you and I talk about a lot
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.780]   is the idea of instructing through conversation.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.780]   So, and then there's this communal aspect, right?
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.780]   'Cause you're giving back responses
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.020]   that are universal to the community that is your church.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.100]   And so that's true for us in classical education too.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.100]   We're responding together in community.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.900]   And then the goal is to worship.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.620]   And so that is the end goal of the catechesis will as well.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.900]   And I think that the church,
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.460]   if we talk about traditional catechesis
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.500]   as ushering people into church membership,
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.740]   this idea of catechesis in a classical Christian education
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.740]   is to usher our kids into full Christian living.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.580]   - You know what?
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.420]   I love that.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.780]   Usher our kids into full,
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.900]   I'm writing it down 'cause I loved it that much.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.980]   Usher our kids into full Christian living.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.500]   As parents, we all have different goals
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.700]   when we begin the homeschooling journey.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.100]   And for a lot of us at the very beginning,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.540]   it was something simple like teach my child to read
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.420]   or make sure they can add and subtract
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.900]   and make change at the store
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.900]   or know how to find places on a map.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:11.380]   A lot of us began with very educational goals
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.100]   and then alongside of them were spiritual goals.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.020]   I want to teach my children at home
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.020]   because I want to have their character formed
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.020]   in the faith tradition that our family celebrates
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.140]   and believes.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.900]   And so for a lot of people at the beginning,
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.700]   those goals are separate.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.540]   And as the Lord works on our hearts
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.740]   and illuminates our understanding,
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.460]   we begin to see, like you said at the beginning,
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.060]   how connected everything is.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.220]   And we realize that the education,
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.420]   the academics that we were pursuing
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.860]   are all tied up with the author of our curriculum,
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.780]   the world, God's world.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.660]   And the best way to achieve all of our goals
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.340]   is to unify our efforts,
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.180]   to know God by what He says in His word
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.860]   and by what He's done and is doing in His world.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.700]   So I love that.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.100]   You made lots of good points for catechesis.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.220]   And I wrote them down because I want to ask you about them.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.420]   I think that catechesis, you're right,
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:26.420]   this is a great way to look at the education
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.820]   that we want to give our children.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.180]   And it highlights, this whole idea of catechesis
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.860]   highlights some of the most important things
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.380]   that we've come to believe about education.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.900]   One, it should be conversational.
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.100]   It should be conversational, why?
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.020]   I know that you and I agree on that.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.420]   So I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.220]   Why is it important for the education
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:56.580]   that we pursue with our families to be conversational?
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:01.580]   - Well, I mean, I think that that has a lot to do
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.460]   with communal education.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.340]   So there have been in the last few years,
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.740]   really since COVID there has been a huge proliferation
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.140]   of online education.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:19.140]   But one thing we know is that we are in soul bodies,
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:25.060]   CS Lewis would say, and that the physical world matters.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.380]   And so by our very nature,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.180]   being together every week in community matters.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.860]   Having an adult who is a tutor
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.140]   in classical conversations community,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.780]   being physically present in the room
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.060]   for these conversations matters.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.900]   That is how God designed us to be, right?
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.300]   He did not have the technology for this obviously,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.380]   but Jesus was with those 12 disciples,
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.900]   day in and day out for those three years.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.060]   And that was the teaching that really embodied
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.540]   what we learned in Deuteronomy about,
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.220]   teach them when you sit down and when you rise up
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.820]   and when you're at home and when you walk along the road
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.740]   that we have, because we are in this physical body,
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.980]   the physical things matter
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.140]   and being together in community matters.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.980]   I was listening to Lee the other day and she said,
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.940]   everyone accepts the idea
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:25.500]   that the students imitate their masters.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.660]   What happens when that master is a computer screen?
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.820]   - Oh, wow, that's really, that's deep.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.180]   If you stop and think about it, I like that.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.300]   I think it's really, really important
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.180]   to teach as you live.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.220]   I mean, some of the best lessons
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.460]   that I ever passed on to my children
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.180]   were not in my lesson plan.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.500]   They weren't in my book.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.540]   It wasn't in the syllabus.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.100]   It wasn't in the challenge guide.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.220]   It wasn't in the foundation's curriculum.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.260]   It wasn't necessarily planned.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.860]   They were lessons that we learned together,
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.380]   a lot of times, that we discovered together
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.220]   as we were living life.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.300]   And sometimes they were, sometimes,
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.060]   Jennifer, I can look back and think,
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.540]   yeah, some of the most important lessons
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.180]   that my children learned,
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.100]   the academic part of it
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.980]   was just kind of along for the ride.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.900]   I mean, it was in the context.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.300]   I keep going back to one of the lessons
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   that my younger daughter learned
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:47.860]   through an absolutely mortifying experience for me
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.980]   as a classical educator.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.020]   At the time, I spent a lot of my time
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:57.300]   talking to other people's groups.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.060]   I mean, I talked to, I was a practicum speaker
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.180]   and I was telling parents.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.220]   I was modeling.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.380]   I was mentoring them on how to live out
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.300]   this classical education journey
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.020]   in a beautiful way at home.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.420]   And one of the most mortifying experiences of my life
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.980]   was working on chemistry with my younger daughter.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.700]   Now, I liked chemistry in high school,
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.140]   but let me share with you that the chemistry we did in CC
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.220]   with my children was way more chemistry
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.180]   than I had ever done in high school.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.940]   And it required me to remember math concepts
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.900]   that I had safely put away in cotton wool
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.060]   and thought I would never have to look at again.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.180]   And so I can remember one day sitting side by side
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.540]   'cause I usually picked one subject to do a deep dive
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.380]   with each girl each semester.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.300]   And so chemistry was what I was doing with this child.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.300]   And we sat down and I guess it was a very harried week
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.220]   for me and I had a lot of other balls
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.980]   that I was trying to juggle.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.940]   And she was having trouble with this stoichiometry problem.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.540]   And I frankly had not really read the module.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.900]   And so I got really frustrated and I just looked at her
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.420]   and I said, "I don't understand.
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.860]   You went to class.
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.020]   It was yesterday.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.780]   You went to community day.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.340]   And I know that Ms. Carey introduced this in class.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.740]   Where are your notes?
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.180]   What did she tell you?"
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.860]   I'm certain she said, "I wrote everything down, Mama.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.140]   I wrote everything down."
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.340]   And I said, "Look, if you had written everything down,
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.420]   it would be here.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.260]   Where is it?
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.900]   It is Ms. Carey's job to have told you this
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.140]   and it's your job to have written it down."
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.620]   And I was just going to town
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.380]   and I all of a sudden heard what I was saying.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.580]   I had actually said to her,
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.220]   "It is Ms. Carey's job to teach you
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.580]   and it is your job to write it down."
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.460]   And I thought, "Oh my gosh."
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.220]   And so I had to take a minute and I said,
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.380]   "Okay, I'm really sorry.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.460]   I have told you two untrue things.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.660]   Well, one for sure.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:01.060]   I have told you that it was Ms. Carey's job to teach you
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.900]   and it's not.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.740]   It's Mama's job to teach you.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.500]   And it's your job to learn.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.060]   And it's our job to struggle on through this together."
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.540]   I said, "So here's what the problem is.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.860]   The problem is math.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.820]   I don't remember.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:13.940]   Daddy remembers.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.340]   You don't want Daddy to show you
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.380]   because you get confused.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.420]   So I will go and Daddy will teach me
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.060]   and I will come back and I will teach you.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.860]   And I'm sorry.
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.740]   You have done everything fine
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.620]   except for maybe write down what you could have.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.260]   And now we're gonna be back on track."
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.620]   And so I learned that lesson and I was mortified
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.700]   and I apologized and she forgave me and we went on.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.060]   Years later, probably two, maybe three years later,
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.580]   she's in college and she calls home and she says,
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.180]   "I am having trouble with this photography class."
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.100]   And I said, "That is an elective that you have chosen.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.580]   Why is this a problem?"
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.100]   She said, "Well, I'm in this such and such level."
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:56.940]   And I said, "Why?
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.180]   That is not beginner level."
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.100]   "Well, my advisor said I would be fine."
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.860]   And I said, "Oh my word, you are not fine.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.820]   There's only one day till the drop ad.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.380]   You need to take care of this.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.220]   You need the prerequisite class."
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.540]   And so she said, "Okay, I'll take care of it."
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.700]   So I didn't ask about it for several weeks.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.060]   And then I got on her Moodle or whatever you call her
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.340]   and looked and she was still in that class.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.660]   And I said, "Honey, what is the deal?"
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:28.060]   And she just said, "Mom, I could tell what it was
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.500]   that I didn't know."
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.900]   It was some grammar.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.700]   I didn't understand some of the basic stuff,
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.100]   but I could tell what it was that I didn't know.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.740]   And so I went online and I figured out what it was
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.180]   and I found what I needed to know and I learned that.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.060]   And I just, I caught up.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.460]   She said, "It's my job to learn it and I know how."
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.940]   So I did.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.780]   - Oh, nice.
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.540]   - And I was floored.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.540]   I didn't know what to say to her.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.020]   And I thought, "Oh my gosh."
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.500]   So that is the lesson of a classical education.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.220]   And it happened while we were living life together.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.860]   And I thought I was teaching her chemistry,
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.020]   that what she was learning is to take responsibility
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:12.860]   for her learning.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.100]   And that is a way that it has paid dividends
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.100]   'cause she has children of her own now.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:24.060]   And I see her teaching her two-year-old
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.980]   about his responsibility for things.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.860]   If you make this choice, this will happen.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.260]   It's up to you.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.700]   And I just, I'm so, I'm so happy
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.060]   that we had that real life lesson from learning.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.100]   And it required a mentor who, you know,
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.140]   hadn't finished learning yet, obviously, me.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.900]   But it was a great lesson
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.540]   and it was a lesson learned as we lived.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.260]   - Yeah, I think that's so good.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.260]   And I think you've highlighted in this episode
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.980]   a couple of things that probably our listeners
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.740]   are wondering about.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:07.580]   And one is just, I'm gonna go back to your history,
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.100]   your English teacher that you talked about
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.900]   how they didn't really give lessons in history.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.740]   They didn't have a way.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.820]   And so we've talked a lot in this episode
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.740]   about, you know, being together,
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.500]   both at home and on the community day,
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.540]   having one to be with the kids for all the subjects.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.740]   And so these conversations and these life lessons
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.740]   naturally happen because of the amount of time
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.980]   that either the challenge tutor or the parent is spending.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.060]   And then the other thing that you illustrated
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.820]   is that even though chemistry
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.220]   wasn't the focus of your story,
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.100]   over the years of you working with your girls,
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.140]   you did recover that knowledge for yourself.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:50.140]   And so I like to think about this idea
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.740]   of both being the home educating parent at home
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.700]   or the challenge tutor in community
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.500]   allows us over time to become master teachers
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.380]   in a lot of things and not a master teacher in one thing.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.500]   And that also ties into us being able to find
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.180]   all those treasures and to celebrate.
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.780]   And it can take, you know, it can take however long
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.540]   the Lord needs it, it can take your whole lifetime.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.460]   But so I would encourage our listeners
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.940]   not to try to fight off all the subjects at once,
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.700]   but I think you and I learned over the years
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.020]   to just take, like you said,
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.660]   take one a year and just dive 'cause you have time.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.140]   - You do have time and the joy,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:39.100]   remember the treasure hunt, the joy is in the journey
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.380]   and you cannot imagine the riches
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.260]   you will find along the way.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.580]   The things that you will learn
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.580]   when you're pursuing something else are beautiful.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:58.260]   There's a lot of joy to be found in knowing your children
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.540]   and in having them know you
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.780]   and in having them know one another.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:10.180]   There's a lot of beauty in creating family memories together
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.060]   as you study together, as you redeem your education
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.020]   'cause parents, you're gonna redeem your education
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.620]   alongside your children.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.620]   And that's another beautiful way
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.780]   that the catechesis wheel works.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.460]   We never fully arrive.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.620]   You know the beauty of a circle
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.420]   in this illustration, right?
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.980]   It's that you keep going around.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.140]   There's not an out.
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.820]   You learn and you build a base of knowledge
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.700]   and then you grow in your understanding
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.140]   and then you get really good.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.380]   So good at understanding what you know
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.260]   that you're able to use it.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.660]   And then what that does is it moves you,
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.660]   like Jennifer said at the beginning, to celebrate.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.420]   It moves you to worship
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.460]   and your worship propels you right back
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.060]   into learning more.
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:14.260]   And that's a beautiful, eternal circle of learning.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.540]   - Yeah, and right at the top of that circle
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.900]   it says the words Christian, echo, and celebration.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.100]   So you're right that that learning to echo
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.100]   and celebration of who God is
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.780]   is the culmination of learning something
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.180]   but it's also what whets our appetite
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.220]   to learn the next thing
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.780]   so that we can circle back around
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.020]   and echo and celebration again.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.660]   - Yes, and I love that.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.300]   And that is the beauty of the circle for this model.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.580]   It really is a picture
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.140]   of what God has designed fellowship
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.220]   and community and education
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.220]   to be a continual echo and celebration.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.900]   Jennifer, thank you so much
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.980]   for unpacking the catechesis wheel a little bit
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.940]   with us today.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.540]   I really appreciate your stories and your insights.
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.940]   - Oh, you too, Lisa, it was fun.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.340]   - And listeners, remember,
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.260]   we are gonna link this blog post
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:20.180]   to Jennifer's article on the catechesis wheel for you
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.260]   in the show notes.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.700]   And so you can go there and read the full article.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.140]   And then if you need a visual to look at
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.900]   and to explore more,
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.060]   maybe you'll even talk about it with your family at home,
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.460]   the catalog, page eight,
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.500]   is where you will find the picture
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.580]   of the catechesis wheel
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.580]   and the reminder
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.340]   that what we're all about in the CC journey
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.620]   is to know God and to make Him known.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.300]   Now, if you are listening to this podcast
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   and you're not a member
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.380]   of a Classical Conversations community
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.180]   and you've never been to a practicum
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.660]   and you really don't know a lot
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.260]   about classical homeschooling,
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.380]   if you're just interested in homeschooling
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.180]   or in what makes CC unique,
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.900]   there's a way for you to discover
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.380]   our Christ-centered classical approach to education.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.980]   You can be connected with experienced CC parents
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.940]   and get answers, immediate answers,
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.580]   to your most asked questions.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.260]   You can find an information meeting near you
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.500]   or online, okay?
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.860]   You can have an in-person information meeting
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.100]   or an online information meeting
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.100]   if you will go to classicalconversations.com/events,
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:50.860]   all right, classicalconversations.com/events,
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:53.900]   and that will give you information
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.580]   that you need to chew on to make a great decision
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.060]   about the education you're pursuing
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.740]   with your beloved family.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.900]   Jennifer, thank you again.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.140]   Listeners, I've enjoyed this.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:10.420]   I hope that it has helped you think more deeply
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.460]   about the treasure that education is supposed to be
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.580]   in our families.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.260]   See you next time.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.860]   (gentle music)
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.360]   (music fades)
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
