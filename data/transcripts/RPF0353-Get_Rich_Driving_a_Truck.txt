[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860]   I'm always on the lookout for interesting ways to earn a living, ways that you can do
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.500]   things that other people dream about doing for recreation and actually make money at
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.500]   it.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.800]   One of the things I've considered in the past was being an over-the-road truck driver, especially
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.380]   if you can do it as a couple.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.280]   I've read stories about retiring couples that go on the road together and they see the country
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.740]   and they make a lot of money while they're doing it.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.020]   Well, sadly, I've never had the opportunity to do it.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:36.280]   Today I've got Ben and Deb Martinek who have graciously agreed to come on and share with
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:54.620]   us what it's actually like.
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.360]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.020]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.020]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.080]   This is the show where we work hard to give you the ideas and insight and knowledge and
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.720]   skills that you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while also building a plan for financial
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.920]   freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.400]   Yes, we want to get there as quickly as possible and wouldn't it be great if you could take
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:26.880]   a retirement lifestyle and just do it now?
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.340]   Frankly I think there are tons of these types of opportunities that are out there and truck
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.280]   driving is just one that I've thought would be pretty cool, especially if you do it full
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.280]   time.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.040]   But never having done it, I can't give you what it's actually like.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.040]   So today we're going to talk with Ben and Deb who've actually done it.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.720]   Guys, I'm sorry I flubbed your name there.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.720]   It's Martinek, right?
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   Yeah, it's Martinek.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.720]   Okay, great.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.520]   So tell me the story.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.640]   How did you guys wind up – I shouldn't say living in a truck.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.680]   I don't think you did that completely.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.960]   But how did you wind up working together as a co-driving truck driving team?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.900]   Well, it started – the conversation started before we got married.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.400]   We both have graduate degrees but in areas that aren't very high paying.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.000]   And so we knew that we had this mountain of student loan debt from going to graduate school
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.720]   at a private university and we weren't quite sure what to do about it.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.640]   And so we knew we wanted to spend time together, make a lot of money to pay off that debt.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.240]   And the only option that seemed to come forward – I mentioned it just one day to Ben when
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   we were engaged.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.720]   Well, maybe we should do truck driving.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.960]   I come from a long line of truck drivers myself and not knowing at the time, but Ben has always
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.560]   had a fascination with large machinery or equipment like that.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.480]   So he took me seriously and started looking into it.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.240]   And the more research we did, the more we realized that you could make a lot of money,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.260]   especially as a husband-wife team.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.560]   And so that's what we set our sights on a few months after we got married.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.960]   Honestly, it was kind of a surprise to me that they even had team truck drivers.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.720]   I thought, wow, maybe – I don't know if they'd even let us both drive the truck.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.840]   I mean, what a novel idea.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.800]   At least it was when we first started looking into it.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.960]   But I was really floored to find out that, yeah, it's very common.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.560]   And actually, husband-wife teams in particular are a very highly-priced commodity in the
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.160]   trucking industry for many reasons.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.800]   But yeah, it's probably some of the best-paying work you can get as a truck driver.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.220]   Let me jump right to the money just because I want to get an idea.
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.120]   How much money could a couple make if they were to pursue this type of work?
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.920]   Well, it would depend on your setup.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.160]   I mean, because you have basically either company drivers or you have what are called
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   owner-operators.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.400]   I mean, are you going to be your own trucking company or run your own truck or are you going
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.480]   to just run somebody else's truck?
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.920]   If you're company drivers, I mean, within nine months from the time we graduated from
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.640]   truck driving school to the time we came out with a second company, we were making $100,000
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   between the two of us.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.760]   And probably, I mean, if we had pushed and done more miles, we could have maybe made
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.400]   it as high as $110,000 as company drivers.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.640]   That's with folks who don't have any financial responsibility by and large.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.800]   I mean, everything's covered by the company.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.600]   The only thing you do is drive the truck and move the freight and go from spot to spot.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.920]   As owner-operators, if you take on more financial responsibility, either between the fuel cost,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.680]   which is a big one, or you're obviously maintaining and keeping the truck, you get a little more
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.840]   liberty in the routes you choose and when you decide to run and when you decide not
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.840]   to.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.840]   But that does have more promise.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.920]   And I mean, it's just like anything.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.520]   I don't think you could immediately step into this.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.480]   But once you learn the business, I don't think it's out of the realm to think you can make
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.320]   as much as $125,000 to $150,000 as a team truck operator.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.400]   And that's probably just as a general average.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.440]   I think the more exclusive you get, the more specialized your routes become.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.520]   And the better either contractors or carriers or shippers you work with, yeah, it could
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.320]   get considerably higher than that.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.240]   - So the basic idea of the team driving, as I understand it, never driven a truck, so
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.000]   just kind of give the intro and I want you to explain it more deeply.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.160]   The basic idea of why a team can be so valuable is by putting two drivers in one truck, you
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.240]   can run much closer to 24 hours a day than one driver because of the federally mandated
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.320]   rest times and the amount of time you're allowed to drive, the number of miles that you can
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   do.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.080]   If you've got two people that can drive and you can split out and one can sleep while
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.400]   the other drives, you can put a lot more hours.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.600]   And so it actually can be a very valuable resource for the company.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600]   Is that accurate?
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   - Absolutely.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.880]   Essentially, you can be driving 22 out of 24 hours in a day.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.520]   And our biggest claim to fame as far as our fastest load that we moved was 2,900 miles
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.600]   from Los Angeles to the Washington, D.C. area, I believe, that we did in just 52 hours, the
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   two of us.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.920]   That was really a lot of fun.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   We stopped, I think, a collective amount of two hours and 45 minutes.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.400]   - That was the truck not moving in that 52-hour period.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.480]   - That includes our inspections that you have to do and then stopping for fuel and then
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   restroom breaks.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.680]   So in two and a half days, not even, we only stopped for three hours total.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   - Wow.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.840]   So obviously, if you like being together, this gives you just a tremendous amount of
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.960]   time to be together.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   What else?
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.360]   Describe to me how you would run.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.760]   You said you weren't in the truck full time.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.720]   You would stop and go other places.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.240]   Describe to me what the lifestyle was like.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.280]   - Well, again, it's largely going to depend on whether or not you're a company driver
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.400]   or not because if you're an owner/operator, there's a lot more freedom into how you run.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.560]   - So which were you guys?
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   - We were company drivers the whole time.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.160]   And honestly, if I were to do this as a long-term vision, I would eventually go as an owner/operator
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160]   without question.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.680]   And towards the end of our time there, I was giving a lot of serious consideration to maybe
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.440]   doing just that.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.120]   But as company drivers, I mean, as long as you have the hours, you're expected to run
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.120]   and move freight.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.880]   And then how busy you are just depends on the company and how well they're doing and
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.120]   how many loads they have available to you.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.400]   And I think there's a lot of factors that come into it.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.280]   I mean, you have both loaded and empty miles.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.480]   And so you might come to a location and deliver a load, but there might not be a local spot,
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.000]   a nearby spot that has another load going out and you may have to travel a long distance.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.720]   I mean, we went as far as, one time it's crazy to think about, but we went as far as a thousand
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   miles to pick up a load.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.280]   It was from Denver, Colorado up to the Los Angeles area.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.720]   So depending on the company and their willingness to run you empty to go pick up another load
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.400]   would depend on how regularly busy you would be.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.640]   But yeah, I mean, I'm trying to forget the question.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   I'm forgetting the question.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.440]   Well, it's kind of a day in the life of what trucking would look like for us.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.880]   Ben usually took the shift from about 2 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.740]   And we tried to keep it at not stopping until you've driven about 200 miles.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.520]   So about every three and a half to four hours, we would stop for a 15 minute break, refill
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.240]   coffee, go to the bathroom, stretch the legs a little bit.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.160]   And then once we would switch over, we would take a little bit of a longer break at that
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.280]   time, fueling up, likely getting a bite to eat.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.080]   And then I would drive from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. roughly.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.680]   So we basically each take a 12 hour shift.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.040]   And depending on how hard we had to run, we wouldn't take many breaks.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.200]   But if we had a little bit more flexibility or if we had finished with a load and we had
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.600]   several hours before the next one would be ready to be picked up, we'd find a truck stop,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.920]   take a shower, get a bite to eat, maybe take a walk.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.000]   You know, if it worked out on Sundays, we'd try to find a church somewhere to go.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.520]   Otherwise it was just pretty, I mean, you're at liberty of the schedule of the loads that
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.480]   they give you, but you could find a lot of fun things to do in the meantime, though,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.480]   too.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480]   You know, it depends on the locale that you would stop at.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.520]   I mean, as you got to know the area of the country, because I mean, you really, over
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.240]   time you have to know the country very well.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.760]   And so if you knew you had time on a load, you would have a spot in mind of like, oh,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.560]   we either have friends here or this has a nice truck stop where there would be easy
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.000]   access to other, maybe public transportation.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.320]   And so we're going to do a long layover here and use this as a chance to go and do some
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.360]   visiting and have some fun.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:06.600]   So, you know, it just depends, I suppose, in terms of your freedom, just how busy of
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.520]   a time of the year it is freight wise.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.640]   You know, as you move towards Christmas, freight picks up.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.800]   And so really from Thanksgiving to Christmas, it's really intense as truck drivers, at least
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   over the road.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.920]   We would normally run 6,000 to 6,500 miles a week.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.520]   I mean, almost no time to stop at all.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.400]   I mean, we were always running freight.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.200]   But right after that, January, February, March, it'd be really slow.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.080]   I mean, it was almost like a 50% reduction from in that point in miles.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.540]   And so you'd have a lot more freedom then to do some sightseeing if you wanted to.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.800]   So you're really only paid per mile, whether you're a company driver or an owner operator.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   Is that correct?
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   Correct.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.320]   Well, it's really by you're paid by the load.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.080]   And then they figure out how much to pay you by the load by the miles.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.600]   So but yeah, I mean, there's not like a daily calculation where you drove so many miles
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.280]   today, so you get paid.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.080]   You ran this freight, you finished this load, now you get paid for it.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.800]   So you said graduated, had a lot of student loan debt.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.400]   What happened for you financially during this period of time?
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.420]   We were able to pay off a lot of our student loan debt.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.760]   That was the main objective.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.160]   You know, it took us probably seven months or so until we were finally at a spot financially
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   that we weren't hurting so bad.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.240]   You know, we weren't just making it from month to month.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.520]   And we were able to make some progress on the debt that we had.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.280]   So it was certainly slow going.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.120]   But that in part was due to the fact that we started in the industry as inexperienced
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.960]   drivers and you need to cut your teeth before you get that pay raise.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.840]   When we first started out, jointly, we were probably only making like $38,000 a year between
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840]   the two of us.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.840]   It was really bad.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.880]   But thankfully, after we had enough experience, we were able to get on with a better national
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.920]   company that paid much – the highest rates in the industry actually and that's when
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.560]   we were able to make about $100,000 a year.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.380]   When you were doing this work, did you live in the truck full time?
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.500]   Did you maintain a house still that you would go back to and how did you work out that mix
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.280]   of working versus not working?
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.840]   So I mean long haul over the road drivers I think pretty commonly are out four to five
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.320]   weeks at a time and then you get a day off for every week that you're out.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.120]   So that's called your home time.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.680]   So we did keep an apartment.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.520]   We had – we're from the Midwest but Deb had spent some time previously out in Central
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.240]   Oregon and wanted to go back and I figured, "Well, what the heck?
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.080]   You know, we're going to be over the road truck drivers anyhow."
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.240]   So we just up and moved back to Central Oregon and we kept an apartment there throughout
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.600]   that time which actually for tax purposes you need – I mean if you're going to be
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:39.240]   able to write off the per diem and some of your pay against per diem cost which can be
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.240]   quite substantial.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.440]   I mean when we were over the road, I think close to 30 to 40 percent of our income was
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.920]   able to be a tax deduction due to per diem but you have to have a home domicile for that
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   to qualify.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.600]   So we had to have something of a residence.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.440]   Otherwise the IRS would have considered us just permanently transient employees.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.040]   Explain some of the details of the compensation because – and kind of how much the costs
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.800]   were to maintain the apartment and not because to me, the big opportunity that I see – I
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.400]   know there are some people who want to do this type of lifestyle for their career and
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.880]   if they can do it, great.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.040]   I don't see how – I couldn't do it but I could do it for a few years doing something
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:22.160]   like you've done and I would – I could see ways that I could put it to good use.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.920]   I think it would be interesting to do for a few years and then move on to something
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920]   else.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.120]   But the financial calculations would seem to me to vary hugely depending on an owner
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.440]   operator versus company and then how the pay is structured and how much your other expenses
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   were.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.600]   So explain how the compensation is structured and your overall expenses, how much you're
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.880]   able to put away due to the trucking lifestyle.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.640]   Again, there is a lot of variability there because you could easily spend a lot of money
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.000]   being over the road.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.480]   So I mean we took cost saving measures in hand.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.440]   We would – we had a small little mini fridge cooler that we kept in between our seats,
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.120]   just plugged into what do you call it, one of the power points in the truck and we would
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.320]   stop for groceries once a week at a Walmart and fill up on different types of fruit, sandwich
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.400]   meats, milk, those sort of things.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.640]   So we did what we could where we purposely kept ourselves to maybe just $10 to $15 a
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.600]   day we would spend on other eating costs.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.240]   Because again, I mean if you're eating out breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, I mean
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   one, you really don't need to because physical activity wise, at least as over the road truck
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.200]   drivers is very minimal.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.320]   So you can easily overeat and start gaining weight and that was something we actually
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.160]   did have to spend a concerted effort to keep our weight in check because we both started
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.040]   gaining some weight.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:45.200]   But yeah, I mean if you're thoughtful about it, I mean our data cost for everything was
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.360]   just about $10 a day between the times we would go out to eat and then our coffee.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.480]   We would grind up our own coffee and had a metal French press and then a large thermos
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.800]   that we would just top off the thermos with hot water at a truck stop and then we just
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.320]   made our coffee in-house.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.160]   And that was probably one of our biggest expenses or could have been one of our biggest expenses
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.920]   because it really, the coffee is super helpful.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.200]   And I mean it was probably just $0.15 a cup for us versus about $1.50, $1.75 that it normally
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   was at a truck stop.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.320]   So I'm trying to think of some of the other cost saving measures.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.400]   I mean we would buy, like other people, we had a membership to Costco.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.600]   So we would buy in bulk and try to get a month's supply of food ration wise and we would work
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.000]   our way through that throughout the time that we were over the road.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.360]   And I'm trying to think if there was anything else, if you have anything else that comes
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.640]   to mind, just I think being thoughtful and considerate to our expenses and trying to
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.640]   keep things low.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.960]   Well and then our household expenses too.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.120]   We still had to pay for the rent at the apartment and utilities and our cell phone and all those
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.960]   things but we actually worked out an agreement with the apartment complex because they needed
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.520]   to keep people in their apartments and we used that as leverage to reduce our rate $100 a
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.640]   month for about a year, which was really nice.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.320]   But I'd say those expenses were probably about $7.50 a month and then you add in what we
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.720]   had for our extra meals or fun things.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.160]   We weren't shy about treating ourselves on the road though either because we were living
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.380]   this nomadic lifestyle for lack of a better term.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:21.840]   We wanted to enjoy ourselves and not scrim so much that we were just, everything that
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.080]   we made was going towards the debt.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.600]   We wanted to enjoy ourselves too.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.400]   So we definitely did that.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   Yeah, there were splurges.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.040]   I mean when you had the opportunity, I mean the thing is, you didn't always have an opportunity
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.400]   to go out to a nice place to eat.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.680]   So usually when that arose, it's like, "Oh, let's do this and we need to take advantage
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   of this."
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.120]   I mean, because you have longer layover periods too.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.320]   So I mean just in terms of the hours that you have, it's probably worth mentioning,
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:50.240]   you have, you know, each day you have roughly 14 hours of time clockwise to do up to 11
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   hours worth of driving.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.300]   And so whenever you either hit that 11 hour mark of driving or that 14 hour period of
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:00.680]   on duty time, you have to stop for at least 10 hours before those two clocks will reset
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.680]   and you can start again.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.320]   So and again, with that 10 hour period, I mean that was enough that when the other person
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.600]   came on to start their driving, they would do enough work that by the time they were
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.480]   ready to finish, my clock had reset.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:19.480]   And then you can do up to 70 hours, I think, in an 80 day period of work, at which point,
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.760]   even as team truck drivers, we'd actually would burn through that.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.120]   So you'd come to a point where our total hours for the whole week would be consumed.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.080]   And then in order to reset that clock, you can either start picking the hours up as the
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.360]   days roll off and roll back on.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   I mean, that can be a little complicated, but you learn it pretty quick.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.520]   Or you just do what's called a 34 hour restart where you have to be stopped for a total of
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.680]   34 hours of off duty work before you can start driving again.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:52.440]   So with a team operation, actually, it's only about 24 hours because 10 hours of one person's
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.800]   clock can be spent in the truck while it's moving down the road.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.000]   So you'd have, you know, once a week, roughly a 24 hour period where there wasn't anything
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   going on.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.560]   And so we would be strategic about like, okay, where do we want to spend our restart at in
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.240]   order to either do some sightseeing or, I don't know, have some fun or this just would
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.200]   be a nice truck stop to relax at or.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   Or have a nice meal.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   Honestly, the meal is having a nice meal was like, I mean, that was like the highlight
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   almost from week to week.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   Where do we want to get our nice meal at?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   So.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.800]   Sounds.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.600]   Sitting in a vehicle driving constantly can be very wearing.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.280]   And even if you've got a bed, you can sleep one at a time.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.400]   I could imagine the anticipation of that day off and having a nice meal or being able to
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.560]   do something really fun.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.640]   Explain please, Ben, what you were saying about the per diem cost and how that's taxed
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.400]   versus the other aspects of your pay.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   Sure.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.200]   I mean, I know some of the details of this, but it's been a little while since some of
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   them are kind of fuzzy.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.920]   So I mean, for most people, if you have to, if your work causes you to be away from where
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.600]   you live for an extended period of time, the meals and the lodging expenses of that can
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.920]   be written off up to 50% associated with that as a tax deduction for anyone who's regulated
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:15.900]   by DOT regulations, the Department of Transportation, it's as high as I think it's 80%.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:22.820]   So as long as you can confirm that your work was taking you away from home, which this
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:29.200]   would be for 30, 40 days at a time, each of those days, I'm trying to remember what the
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   cap amount was.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.080]   I mean, I think they allowed it like $150.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.440]   So like 80%, and this is just typical IRS stuff, is like 80% of $150 or something every
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:44.240]   day per driver was a tax write off your income.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:53.220]   So how much is a standard mileage rate when you're a top driver at a good company?
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.340]   Well, I mean, this is five years removed.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.100]   At the time, it was $0.48 a mile is what we were making.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.420]   I think things have adjusted with inflation.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.020]   They're probably closer to mid-50s now.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.220]   So, yeah.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.060]   So let's just use $0.55 per mile.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.820]   And how many miles could you generally do in a day?
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.700]   We would shoot when we were...
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.940]   So you don't necessarily every single day run a load.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.420]   I mean, it all just depends on how loads line up.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.300]   But when we were on a load and running, it's probably at least 1,200, 1,250 miles a day
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   is what we would run.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.300]   For each of you or...
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   Total.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.300]   Total.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   An average of 5,500 miles a week.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.100]   So that $1,200 would come out...
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.460]   1,200 miles would come out to $660 earned in a day between the two of you.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.980]   And then what you're saying is that if you could have, let's say, up to $120, $150 a
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.300]   day, so let's just say half of that would be as a per diem reimbursement, then the idea
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.020]   there is that's not subject to tax.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.700]   Subject to income tax.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:56.180]   And so you've got about $300 to $400 for that day of work that would be classified as ordinary
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.220]   wages as a company driver.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.980]   And as ordinary wages, then that's the money that'd be subject to income tax.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.660]   So even though you might be earning, say, $100,000 in a year, if we just use that with
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.700]   ratios, you're actually going to be reporting income of like $55,000 or $60,000.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.700]   Is that accurate?
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.700]   Yep.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.700]   That's pretty accurate.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.580]   So yeah, the IRS is presuming that you're spending a large amount of money in both food
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.540]   and lodging costs every day, and that's what they're giving you the tax deduction for.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.980]   But in reality, I mean, we were spending like 10 bucks a day out of our own pocket to cover
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:27.980]   the cost.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.340]   I mean, lodging was provided by the truck in the sleeper cab.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.460]   And then, yeah, we weren't spending anywhere near what they were wanting to offer to us
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.460]   as a tax deduction.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:43.740]   Are there a lot of team drivers who do this full-time and don't maintain a place to live?
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.620]   You know, I don't know if that's so much the case.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.460]   I mean, there are plenty of guys that we came across, older couples.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.740]   I mean, there's a large number of married couples, one out there, especially I would
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:58.220]   say most, a good percentage of team truck drivers are married couples.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.860]   But I mean, I suppose it depends from couple to couple, but I mean, I heard of folks who
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.860]   would be away from home for three to four months at a time.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.500]   I mean, they were really, they just lived on the road and then they just came home.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.580]   Home was like a vacation spot for them.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.620]   I maybe get a new fresh thing of clothes or something.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.420]   I mean, I couldn't believe being away.
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.300]   There were a few times where we were gone for as long as 10 weeks from our place.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.900]   And that felt like a really long time.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.140]   I can't imagine being three to four months away from home before coming back.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.500]   I mean, it'd be like going out to sea or something.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.700]   How did you know when it was time to quit?
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.060]   Yeah, well, I'll let Deb chime in on that.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.380]   Well, I was experiencing some poor health issues that weren't related to trucking, but
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.660]   were kind of exacerbated by it.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:46.380]   And so we had weighed our options and realized that if we were going to get off the road,
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.380]   now was the time.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.300]   It would be better sooner rather than later.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.620]   And so we started looking into what our options after life on the road would be.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.820]   And through a lot of providential design, actually, we came across Bismarck, North Dakota
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:05.500]   and decided that that seemed to be a very appropriate fit, which seemed really strange
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.820]   because we were, in all of our time on the road, we had often made lists in our minds,
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.700]   you know, like, "Oh, if we ever move from Oregon, this is where we'd want to live,"
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.740]   or "This is definitely where we wouldn't want to live."
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.460]   And Bismarck, North Dakota had never been on that list.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.220]   Nowhere in North Dakota had been on that list.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.700]   But then it just seemed to, everything fell into place.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.540]   And there was a lot of peace about that decision.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.500]   And so we had decided it was shortly after Thanksgiving one year.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:36.620]   And then by Christmas time, we had put a deposit on an apartment and moved to Bismarck in early
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.460]   February and haven't looked back.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.060]   So it was really good timing for us to get off the road in a lot of ways.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.380]   We didn't see it all at the time, obviously, but it's worked out very, very well since
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.380]   then.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.620]   You stole the next question out of my mouth.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:55.020]   I was going to say, in seeing all these areas of the country, what did you learn and what
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.940]   are your perspectives about different areas?
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:02.500]   And since you started the answer with Bismarck, what is it about Bismarck that you like compared
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.220]   to all the places that you've been?
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.740]   Well, it's hard to get a real feel for the community when you're out on the road.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:14.460]   You can get a feel for just the area driving through.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.660]   One of my favorite places to drive, this is often a question that people ask, "Where did
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.660]   you like to drive the most?"
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.580]   And the answer is always Nebraska, always Nebraska.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.940]   And I ate in Nebraska because there's very few people, even Omaha, a city of over 400,000
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.700]   people, which may seem really small to some of your listeners, but that's kind of a big
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.460]   deal in the Plains States.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:38.820]   Even in rush hour traffic, you never had to drive below 55 miles per hour.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.660]   It was just very smooth driving and the rest of the state was just wide open Plains and
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.460]   very easy to drive through.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.180]   In short, it was easy money.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.460]   For truck drivers, for us, I know other guys thought it to be boring, but for me, I loved
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.460]   it.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.460]   It was just so much money.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.780]   You could easily listen to other stuff while you're going down the road, listen to books
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.860]   on tape and that sort of thing.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.260]   We ate going up through the Plains States whenever we could.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.020]   Other parts of the country, oh my Lord, it's so congested.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.020]   You really earned your money.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.340]   You had to be paying attention and just stay calm and patient and work with traffic.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:17.980]   But once we found and settled in Bismarck, there are the stereotypes that people have
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.060]   about North Dakota, that you get that North Dakota nice and people give you the shirt
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.420]   off the back.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.020]   We weren't quite sure what to expect.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.100]   We just thought people talked weird.
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.420]   But once we got here, it's just one of the most amazing communities that I've ever had
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.420]   the privilege of being part of.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.260]   That's what made us want to stick around.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.340]   We thought maybe that this would just be kind of a temporary thing for us to finish paying
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.020]   off the last of our student loan debt and then we'd end up moving elsewhere.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.140]   It providentially has not worked out that way and we're very thankful for that.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.620]   Aaron Powell You both had college degrees before working
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.620]   in trucking.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.940]   I've designed this scenario in my mind as kind of a radical financial plan of using
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:04.220]   trucking as a base of operations to become educated in an area and to start a business.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.700]   I'll just tell you kind of what I've sketched out in my head as what might work and then
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.180]   you feel free to shoot holes in it.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:18.300]   But it seemed to me that if somebody went into trucking, a single person with few family
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:24.300]   connections that they needed to be in a certain place, they could use trucking as a way to
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:31.300]   become extremely well educated, establish a starting fund to launch their life or to
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:37.540]   launch a business and to – it's just a really good integrated way.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:43.460]   So if a single person were very flexible and they could not worry with the home base or
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.220]   they could just simply rent a cheap room somewhere and sometimes they go back to that room for
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.620]   their week off.
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.720]   Sometimes they just take a week in a hotel in some other location.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.940]   But given those restrictions on the time, the amount of time that you can do on the
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.540]   road, you're going to have some time sitting around where you're not going to be driving
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.540]   and you're not going to be sleeping.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.980]   I always go into the truck stops.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.340]   I love to go to truck stops when I travel and I just see so many drivers just sitting
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.580]   there watching TV.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.700]   And I'm sure that – I'm sure – and I – you walk around – I walk – I always
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.260]   love to walk around the parking lot if I'm walking my dogs or something at night and
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.460]   it seems like every other truck cab has the TV going.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:23.300]   And I just think, "Man, you guys are wasting an opportunity for education."
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.860]   Take some of that time and sit in your truck, get yourself a nice meal and get some books,
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.100]   do some correspondence classes.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:34.180]   With the time that you can spend consuming audio content, you can stream YouTube lectures,
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.620]   you can stream all kinds of things.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.660]   You could become so well-educated in a few years.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.140]   You could save a ton of money.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.700]   And so any young – I guess you need to be 18 to get a CDL or 21.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.700]   Do you know?
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.700]   21.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.700]   OK.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.700]   So a young – it doesn't work for a teenager.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.940]   But somebody who's 21 years old who doesn't have resources could use trucking as a way
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:59.180]   to earn an income, save a lot of money, keep their expenses low, do it for three or four
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.580]   years, become extremely well-educated in a certain area with being able to read during
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:09.100]   their time off, buying audio books on tape in their area or using some of the technology
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.300]   now of text-to-speech reading, the Kindle reading, things like that to consume some
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.940]   of the books that don't have audio books, listening to podcasts, lectures.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.220]   And then you have time in the evenings or whenever time during the day that you're
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.220]   stopped.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.340]   You can take a couple hours every day and use that time to study and just really launch
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.800]   in a really intelligent way.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.620]   Is that possible or am I just delusional?
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.220]   You are 100% accurate.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.800]   Ben often made the comment whenever we were really getting into the thick of things with
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.180]   driving and once we had discovered podcasts and iTunes U and all these different things
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:52.260]   that we could immerse ourselves in education-wise, he would often say, "Man, I don't know
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.340]   why I ever decided to go to college.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.180]   I should have just driven in a truck and got my education this way because I wouldn't
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.740]   have all this student loan debt to pay off."
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.520]   So you are very like-minded with Ben and his thoughts there, Joshua.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.160]   I mean, you just take the amount of student loan debt.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.480]   How much student loan debt total did you guys pay off?
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.200]   Well, student loan debt plus some of our credit card debt or retail debt, we had about $160,000
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.160]   total and we paid off a little over $100,000 while we were on the road.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   Okay.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.440]   So let's just use that $100,000 number.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.000]   And how many years were you working together doing this full-time to pay off that $100,000?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Two and a half years.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.260]   It was, but really the first six months of that, it was just a break even because we
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.060]   were so little paid.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.020]   So I mean, you'd have to look at this in the first six months.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.800]   You're not going to make a lot of money, but it starts to pick up after that point.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.860]   Which is reasonable.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.860]   So let's assume that somebody could do what you did.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.340]   To be able to start and pretend they didn't have the student loan debt, to be able to
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:53.140]   start with $100,000, $100,000 is enough to buy you a huge measure of financial freedom.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.740]   It's enough to fund the startup of a business.
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.320]   It's enough to fund seed capital, to fund various investments.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.580]   $100,000 is down payments on rental houses.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.900]   $100,000 is seed company for all kinds of things.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:12.820]   $100,000 is enough for anybody who wants to have a freedom fund that they can use and
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.700]   leverage that into just about anything else.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:21.420]   So in two and a half years, by cutting the expenses and having the lower expenses associated
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.580]   with the trucking lifestyle and having the income and having the dual use of the time,
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:30.660]   just about any normal person can learn to drive a truck and have a freedom fund in two
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.660]   and a half years.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.660]   Yep.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.100]   No, that really isn't unrealistic at all, actually.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.220]   Because Deb and I both hadn't had our master's degrees fully completed either when we were
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.220]   over the road.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.940]   So I finished my master's thesis while driving and she completed her and prepared for her
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.740]   comprehensive exams while driving.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.380]   So I mean, it does lend itself to even in-depth study.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.380]   I mean, there are limitations.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.940]   I mean, there are some of the challenges we faced, somebody would face.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.900]   Life is so varied and jostled.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.760]   And as much as you try to keep a schedule, there could be so many things that would just
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.180]   mess up your plans.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.900]   And so you have to have a willingness to be flexible and just kind of let things come
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.140]   as they play out.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.780]   Because of that jostling, it would be hard to stay motivated or focused.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.300]   Sometimes all you wanted to do was just rest or just get out of the truck too, honestly.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.060]   I mean, it's an eight by eight foot box is all you're staying in.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.540]   But that said, I mean, I think if you were focused enough, determined enough, and we
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.100]   were pretty, we were able to take advantage of it.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.220]   Because even when you have 10 hours off, the other person's driving and you're in the back
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.700]   sleeping, you don't sleep the whole 10 hours.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.820]   I mean, it was only a handful of times that either one of us conked out and stayed asleep
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.100]   the entire time in the back.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:50.100]   A lot of times, at least for me in particular, the time that I ran, I'd just sleep for three
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.220]   or four hours, then I'd be awake for three or four hours.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.620]   And that's when I would work on other things.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.380]   I mean, I'd go back to sleep for another two to three and then get ready to go for my next
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.380]   shift.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.380]   So.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:06.460]   So since then, you've gone on and you started a financial planning business.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:12.460]   So tell me about kind of this transition and how you actually exited truck driving to do
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.340]   financial planning and how truck driving still plays a role in your current lifestyle.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.340]   Right.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:24.260]   Well, I mean, I had got interested in finance business investing way back in grad school.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:29.460]   A fellow classmate of mine was already running a few businesses.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.620]   And honestly, I'm not even quite sure why he decided to pursue a master's degree in
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.540]   philosophy, but he did.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.780]   And he turned me on to some of this stuff.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.980]   So it was already in my mind before we started driving truck.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:46.220]   But we eventually stumbled upon Dave Ramsey and his radio program and what he had offered.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.980]   I mean, that was one of the other fun things is you could listen forever.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:54.340]   You know, I mean, the podcast weren't quite as prominent as they are like today, but I
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.020]   mean, they were they were around.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.900]   But I mean, Dave Ramsey's radio show, we both listened to it for three hours a day.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.660]   So that really got our interest peaked when it came to finance.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.860]   That really helped, too, with maintaining our focus and commitment and dedication to
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.380]   what we were doing and getting about gazelle intensity.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.380]   Yeah, right.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.420]   You know, every day, you know, we have Dave telling us, you stay focused, stay focused,
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.420]   stay focused.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.420]   And I mean, it was good.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.620]   It was like a coaching for us as we were living day in, day out on the on the road.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.220]   So he actually was the one who introduced the idea of becoming a CFP.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:28.440]   A few people had inquired about how maybe they could make a career helping others financially.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.340]   I had no idea even up to that point.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.860]   I had studied five or six years, a lot of it just for personal reasons as a hobby.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.780]   But yeah, he he suggested you could become a CFP.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.980]   And I had never heard of that before, you know.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.380]   And so I checked into that.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.100]   And that's when I started tossing that around as a potential career move once we finished
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.740]   with truck driving, because we always knew it to be a temporary thing.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.420]   We wanted to do it as well.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.780]   We want to do it for a lot of reasons.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.860]   But one of them, the main reasons was student loan repayment.
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.940]   And the other is you're newly married and we're young and we're like, what the heck?
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.940]   Let's go see the country.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.940]   This will be fun.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.140]   We're going to get paid to do this.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.600]   So but long term wise, I didn't want to continue truck driving forever.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.720]   So it's like, well, how are we going to transition?
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.380]   So yeah, I mean, I had considered quite a few options.
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:18.740]   I had given thought maybe to going back to academia and pursuing a doctorate and maybe
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:23.180]   resuming a career path, teaching philosophy at a college.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.260]   But it just seemed to me, I suppose, to make the most sense to continue on a finance.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.940]   I saw that as just a better, better alternative.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.540]   So it's been something that's been in the works in terms of getting this business off
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.700]   the ground for probably five years or better now.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.900]   And it's yeah, we're slowly, slowly getting together.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:44.660]   We've officially launched last year and we're really catering to the younger generations,
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.080]   folks who are in the XY generation and trying to help them.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.780]   If you could look at kind of a financial trajectory, it's almost like an air flight.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.860]   You know, you have your takeoff and then you get up to kind of a cruising altitude and
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.280]   then you go and land.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.500]   I think a lot of financial planning is geared towards people who are in that coasting mode.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.940]   You know, they've reached their high altitude phase and now they're looking maybe eventually
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.420]   to land the plane.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.460]   Not a lot's being given to the people who are on the front side of things.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.260]   And that's where I want to be putting my focus and effort and assistance to for clients.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:20.420]   So you're building, your firm is called Bonafide Finance and you're building kind of the model
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.100]   we've talked about many times, the XY planning network model of small practice working with
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.980]   younger couples doing fees that are not just based upon assets under management but based
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.580]   either on an hourly or retainer model.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.580]   Is that accurate?
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.580]   Yeah, right.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.180]   And it's, you know, a fee for service too.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.620]   So I have some specific selected services that I would offer either kind of a comprehensive
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.900]   plan or a plan broken up in parts and then you're paying for specific parts.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.300]   So depending on maybe what a client would need or want.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:54.860]   Yeah, you know, giving some, in my opinion, third party objective advice to a person's
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.220]   circumstances and kind of giving them direction and guidance as to where they got to go and
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.620]   what they need to do right now in their finances.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:05.300]   What I have found to be really powerful about that is because there isn't any involvement
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:11.420]   of a product, people really take to heart that when I say you need to, let's say, get
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.220]   long-term disability, they don't bat an eye on it.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   They're like, "Oh, okay.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:19.700]   I had no idea that that was such an important component to our finances.
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.940]   We're going to look into that right away."
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.780]   You know, I mean, now there's still a question of how much they can afford, maybe what exactly
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.660]   is the right plan for them.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.940]   But in terms of communicating the urgency to people, it seems to me a very effective
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:40.220]   way for people to come across and get the message that this is something you need.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.580]   With regard to your, you're in the startup phase still, the business, working on it for
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.260]   a couple of years, you're still driving a truck, right?
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.900]   It's a way to part-time produce extra income.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.900]   Is that right?
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.060]   So I mean, one of the things that did bring us out to Bismarck, it's kind of a long story
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:02.180]   in that regard, but the parent company of one of the child companies that was working
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.780]   out of Central Oregon resides in Bismarck.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:09.180]   And so the idea early on was maybe I would come on over here as a truck driver with a
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.540]   larger company, and then maybe we could find out a way to get relocated back to Central
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.420]   Oregon, just because we liked it there so much.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.460]   And it's a really, really beautiful area.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.740]   I mean, the whole Northwest, people aren't familiar with the Pacific Northwest, they
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.740]   should go and visit.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.980]   It's gorgeous.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.460]   But yeah, that initial plan had fallen through.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.740]   I decided to get on with an insurance company here locally early on and try to make a go
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.980]   of financial planning then.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:36.340]   And that was my first introduction in the business and started to see how things were
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.340]   done.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.540]   And honestly, some of it was kind of a surprise in terms of what was being done was different
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.500]   from what I was expecting.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:48.580]   But when that arrangement didn't fully pan out, I decided to go back to local truck driving.
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.980]   So none of this is over the road, what I currently do.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.700]   I work with the part of the business that's called LTL, that's on a full truckload.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.220]   And I run what's called a dedicated route, in which freight more or less makes its way
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.460]   up to our terminal here in Bismarck.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.700]   And then I'm the one who delivers it for the customers up into the specific region of the
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.980]   state that has been assigned to me.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:15.940]   So I run that route twice a week and make my deliveries.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.180]   I go out and I come back in the same day.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.500]   And honestly, it's really come to be rather enjoyable for me.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.660]   I like running that route, but it's also given me the flexibility to focus on running the
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.660]   business.
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.180]   I still get about 30 hours worth of work in those two days.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.660]   And then I have the other five days of the week to focus and work on the business and
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.220]   meet and work with clients.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:41.100]   Do you have a guess of what your hourly rate is running a route like that?
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.860]   Well, it is paid hourly.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.900]   So I mean, there's some parts of the LTL business that are paid by the mile.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.540]   But the work that I do as a pickup and delivery driver is paid hourly.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.580]   So yeah, right now I'm making $25 an hour.
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.960]   If you wanted to do this from a long term perspective, I mean, there's some other carriers
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.140]   that pay better for sure.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.820]   And I know of them to be as much as $27 to $29 an hour.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.100]   But you know, the exact payout that's just going to be dependent upon local demand for
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.540]   truck drivers and where you're at in the country.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.500]   Here locally with the oil boom that took place, that really pushed the hourly wages up for
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   drivers.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.060]   So I'm really benefiting from the local boom that took place.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.740]   My wage is I think higher than the average driver for the standard of living that we
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.740]   have.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.740]   That's great.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:27.100]   The reason why I point that out, I think a lot of people often would see doing something
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.500]   like you're doing as a negative thing.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.380]   They say, "Well, you're a financial planner but you're a truck driver.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:37.060]   Like these things don't usually go well together."
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.860]   But to me, I see it as a positive because it allows you to do a couple of things.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.020]   I've done the same thing with Radical Personal Finance, working on the side.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.820]   If you have to put all of the pressure on a new business to make you income in the short
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.860]   term, it can be very challenging to get a business from nothing to profitable enough
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:59.260]   to run your lifestyle in a short period of time, especially if you're trying to not sacrifice
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.500]   your integrity or not sacrifice your principles or if you're trying something new.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.980]   So having a side job can be really, really valuable.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:13.180]   Working as a truck driver is almost the perfect type of side job to have where you are in
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.820]   some ways your commodity.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.820]   You're just a driver.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.820]   You show up.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.820]   You do your job.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.180]   Once your job is done and the load is there and the truck is parked back at the depot,
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.180]   you're done.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.940]   There's nothing about the job that follows you home.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.860]   You don't have to deal with any stress of those things.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.460]   You're just working while you're working and when you're not working, you're not working.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:35.580]   Because there's licensing requirements and professional experience requirements, that
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:40.420]   raises your hourly wage substantially and it can be a great way to spend and take a
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.220]   couple of days and make some money to make it worth it.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.580]   That allows you to buy your independence because you wouldn't be able to start without that.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.140]   It would be very difficult to start a financial planning firm from scratch where everything
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.340]   is on you and be able to do it profitably from the beginning without burning through
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.340]   a tremendous amount of savings.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:03.080]   So I point it out as a positive benefit because it allows you to keep your independence.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.500]   It allows you to keep your business model pure.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.300]   You don't have to sacrifice anything that's important to you in order to gain enough money
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.100]   from some other aspect.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.900]   I think that is something that many people should seriously always consider looking for
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:27.060]   is the type of thing that you're doing where you can gain income without being emotionally
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.700]   committed to the future of the side job.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.700]   >> Sean Esterly: Right.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.180]   I can't say it's a perfect setup that I have right now.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.980]   I don't know if I could have dreamt up an even better setup.
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.540]   And some of it comes to the company that I work for.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.140]   It's a local outfit that's headquartered out of Fargo here.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.940]   They're mostly an upper Midwest company.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:51.220]   But what's kind of a typical saying you might hear, they're large enough to make it work
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.940]   but small enough to care.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.780]   They have still kind of a mom and pop family atmosphere to them even though they're probably
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.320]   750 employees large or something.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.100]   And so I know the managers directly.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.460]   We all know each other very well.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.140]   And so they know exactly what I'm up to.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.220]   They know that I'm trying to get this business going.
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.580]   They're happy to see me try to do it.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.320]   They think it's great of me.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.580]   And they're kind of willing to help me succeed.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.700]   They want to work with me.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.100]   But at the same time, I'm also doing a route that a lot of other drivers don't want to
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.100]   run.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.180]   And to be honest, I don't understand why it is.
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.860]   The route that I have, it takes about three hours to get up there.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.580]   And then depending on just the freight we have for the day, when the deliveries are
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:35.580]   at and potential holdups that you might have with each of the deliveries, it'll take anywhere
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.180]   between four to six hours to get unloaded.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.300]   And then it's three hours back and then maybe some dock work.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.420]   So the days tend to be long.
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.820]   I mean, it's usually about 14 hours.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.180]   They've been as long as 16 hours for me.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:52.140]   But I mean, I've got three hours of driving, six hours total coming and going to be able
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:57.180]   to listen to podcasts, to do other things, to think or just take a break and enjoy the
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.180]   prairie, honestly.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.380]   I live in a really beautiful part of the country and it's quiet.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.380]   It's easy driving.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:08.340]   I mean, short of the winters that can be tough, sledding, you know, use that expression.
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.580]   But not every day is that way.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:13.220]   Even during the wintertime, I have a lot of freedom to just kind of do what I need to
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.020]   do and pursue that.
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.020]   And the company I have, again, is supportive.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.340]   They think it's kind of great that I'm doing this too and I'm not going to just be a truck
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.340]   driver.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.340]   That's great.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.340]   I'm with you.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.340]   I like driving.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.700]   If someone would pay me $25 an hour to go out and drive two days a week, I don't know.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.500]   I'd be tempted by that because I enjoy it.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   I like driving.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.700]   It's one of my things.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.140]   I enjoy it.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.140]   I like being out on the road.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:45.380]   One of my happiest places is being behind a wheel with the interstate in front of me.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.180]   Well, and honestly, once you add the gears, I mean, it's a 10-speed transmission.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.260]   So you just get used to it.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.420]   You're shifting and you got air brakes and the whole bit.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.980]   I mean, there's a lot I love about driving.
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:55.980]   I feel like a man.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.980]   I know.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:57.980]   Well, I've got a beard now to go with it.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.980]   I feel like I'm the truck driver.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:07.980]   You put on your flannel shirt and someday soon, you'll probably start chewing tobacco
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.980]   to fit in.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.980]   I'm going to put a stop somewhere.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   I might interfere with the wife.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:11.980]   Indeed.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:12.980]   Indeed.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   Well, awesome.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:18.820]   Ben, Deb, this has been really fun.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.980]   Is there anything else or any words of wisdom, even speaking to truck drivers, anything else
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:27.740]   that you'd love to share with my audience about ways to really use this idea or other
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.420]   ideas to capitalize and improve their own financial lives?
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:36.940]   I would just say that you have to be open and realistic that life demands sacrifice,
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.280]   no matter how you look at it, no matter what your end game is.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.180]   You need to sacrifice sometimes in little ways, sometimes in big ways, but that can
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.540]   really give you a big payoff.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:50.380]   I mean, when we first started off trucking, I certainly never thought we'd be and ended
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:54.220]   up living in North Dakota with the life that we have now, live now, but we never would
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.340]   have gotten here had we not taken the steps we did and drove all those miles we did and
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.580]   had that experience of truck driving.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.140]   So it was a lot of fun, but it was also a sacrifice in a lot of ways.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:10.580]   I mean, we kind of glorify it a little bit in our memory, I think, but you deal with
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.820]   a lot of frustration.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:16.940]   And so there is some hardship that comes with it, but it's worth every bit of sacrifice,
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.380]   not only with over-the-road truck driving, but also with the driving that Ben is doing
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:24.060]   now in the midst of working on his business.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.940]   But it's so worthwhile.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.500]   You see the end game in sight, and you've got to charge through sometimes to get to
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.940]   that point, but it's worth it every single time.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.940]   Right.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.240]   Well, and then, honestly, truck driving is not a bad career.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.260]   In terms of blue-collar work, it's probably some of the best work you can get out there.
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.660]   I mean, right now, I do LTL work, so I actually move the freight.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.780]   So I mean, it's a little more labor-intensive, which I actually kind of enjoy.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:51.500]   I mean, my workout twice a week is my job.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.220]   I don't have to pay any extra for it.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.100]   And I mean, some of my pallets, I move up to 3,000 to 4,000 pounds.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.740]   I mean, that's not common, but they do get that heavy.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:04.700]   And yeah, I mean, you build some bulk to be able to do the job.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:09.260]   But I mean, I don't know, even just over-the-road truck driving, if you're willing to pursue
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.380]   some of the more special lines of hauling, it can pay very well for you.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.820]   I mean, because things you may not think about, but I mean, like a museum art exhibit that
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.480]   has to be moved around from the country has to be hauled by a truck driver.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.460]   And so a lot of times, they're responsible, too, for the loading and unloading the freight.
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:26.460]   You can step into that.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:31.260]   Baseball teams, concerts, I'm trying to think of some of the other more special lines, you
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:36.900]   know, oversize, over-length, those sort of loads, which require a good bit of experience
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   to get into.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:42.020]   But once you get into that, that can be a very good paying line of work, even on a long-term
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.020]   basis.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.500]   I have to be honest, every now and again, I'm tempted.
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:48.620]   I'm like, well, maybe I'm at a point now where I've driven enough, I have a clean up enough
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:53.020]   of a record, it's sometimes tempting, like maybe I should just pursue that, you know,
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.740]   that would be a nice, could be a nice career path.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.380]   The work isn't that intensive for once it is, once you learn it.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:04.900]   And it pays well for the amount of time it took you to become a truck driver.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.780]   I would also certainly, just as kind of a closing thought here, recommend for those
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:14.060]   that are nearing retirement age, we've often talked that once we hit that, or once our
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.300]   daughter or any possible future children are out of the house, that we would like to go
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.620]   back to trucking just because it was such an enjoyable time, and you get paid for it.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.620]   So what's not to love about that?
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.780]   You get to see the country, you get a lot of great experiences, eat some great food
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.020]   and get paid very well.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:34.340]   You reminded me of one other thing, though, that I need to ask you about real quick.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:38.340]   Because in closing up, and just one comment on what you said.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.580]   Trucking is a great career, I'll phrase it in the form of a question.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.980]   Obviously you've seen, trucking would be a great career with the exception of if you
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.980]   have a family, right?
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:52.380]   I mean, I just see some of these men especially who are out on the road, like you said, when
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:57.420]   you're on the road weeks at a time, even if you can just call home and talk to your family
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:02.220]   every night or every day, that's still nothing like being there.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.580]   And so it would seem to me that, yeah, husband and wife couple out together, that could be
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:11.740]   really good, but I would have a very difficult time recommending over the road trucking as
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.620]   a career to anyone with a family.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.620]   Am I accurate in that?
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.620]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.620]   - Yeah, that is definitely accurate.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:18.820]   And it is the thing to keep in mind.
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.620]   I mean, the industry is aware of this.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:25.420]   I mean, right now there's a shortage of drivers, so I mean, they know they need to be doing
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.620]   more to try to make it more appealing to folks to try to step up and do this.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.540]   It's an older generation, older, I don't remember what the average age is for drivers, but I
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.820]   know it's higher than what the industry would like it to be.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:43.540]   But it's because of those challenges of how can we make this work where we need a driver
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:48.020]   who's flexible and can be anywhere and go anywhere at any time, but who's also able
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.700]   to support a family and actually be at home.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:56.100]   Because I met plenty of guys who were trying to do that, and it was just, it was the pits
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.660]   for them because you'd get home for three to four days and you would just want to use
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:05.500]   those time, that time just to rest yourself, to kind of recuperate from the jostled schedule
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.540]   that you have as a truck driver.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.140]   And then there'd be this long hunting to-do list that you'd like to get to, but by the
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.460]   time you finally got somewhat acquainted and to schedule it back home, it was time to go
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.460]   back on the road.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:21.860]   And so, I don't know, it definitely is not the life for someone who's got a young family
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:24.400]   especially, but really a family at all.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:29.060]   It's better suited if you're either single or, well, you're an older couple who is wanting
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.060]   to retire.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.140]   Honestly, if you're looking to retire, I couldn't recommend it enough.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:38.260]   I do think it would be a great, it does have its takeaways and there are plenty of stuff
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.900]   to learn and things to do and not to do.
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.540]   But yeah, I think if you're an older couple and you wanted to use truck driving as a retirement
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.540]   plan, it wouldn't be a bad idea at all.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:51.020]   - So the other question I was going to ask is, there are other methods or ways that you
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:49:00.140]   could get into driving as an income source that doesn't necessarily involve a semi-truck.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:06.780]   So for example, I've spent some time sometimes poking around the expediter forums online
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:10.660]   reading about these guys and they're driving a van and they're doing expedited freight,
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:15.220]   hauling a couple of pallets in a big white van from one destination to another.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:19.100]   Could you just touch briefly on some of the other business models if somebody wanted to
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:23.740]   pursue something like this but they didn't necessarily want to drive an 18-wheeler and
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.380]   talk about the advantages and disadvantages of those models?
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:31.140]   - Right, I mean that's not something I'm as familiar with but towards the end of our time,
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.780]   we were certainly giving serious consideration becoming owner-operators.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.620]   Because again, I haven't gone into the detail of that.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:41.020]   There was one driver I came across, one of the big reasons for why I started considering
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:46.700]   is we happened to talk to a guy from the Northeast and we met up with him in Portland, Oregon
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.260]   at a truck stop watching a baseball or a football game.
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:55.580]   And he hauled veneer panels from the Northeast out to Central Oregon to have them applied
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:59.020]   to plywood so that they could then be shipped back out to Chicago.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.580]   So some of this stuff is nuts too.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.940]   First of all, the routes, you have to get something all the way from the Northeast out
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.800]   to the West Coast, they only go back East.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:11.460]   But he got paid just for that one shipment from the Northeast out to Central Oregon.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:16.080]   It took him about four days as a solo driver and he got paid about eight grand to cover
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.860]   all this cost, more or less per week to do that.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.740]   And then he would have freight already set up to take him back.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.940]   And so he had in his own particular circumstance, I mean, he only had to work about nine months
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.780]   out of the year, he had great flexibility.
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.300]   And he was making about 100 grand, I think.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.140]   I mean, this was netting each year for that nine months worth of work and really opened
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.220]   up the doors for him to do a lot of other activities.
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.060]   So I mean, I was like, wow, owner-operator, this could be kind of sweet.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:45.040]   There's a lot of good pay potentially there and flexibility.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:52.060]   So one of the aspects then of trucking is called custom critical or the expedited side
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.980]   of the business where folks need something that's either highly secure or highly time
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:00.980]   sensitive and needs to go with great urgency.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.260]   And you don't have to necessarily haul an 18-wheeler, although there are custom critical
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:08.740]   18-wheeler divisions, but a lot of them are just straight vans with a very nice sleeper.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:13.580]   They tend to have a much nicer sleeper than you have in your typical semi.
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.360]   And people just go around in a straight truck moving freight.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.960]   It's kind of like an ambulance-like setup.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.400]   Once you get the call for the freight to be moved, you have to stop and drop everything
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.600]   you do and move.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.120]   But yeah, the pay in that sort of circumstances is pretty good.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.240]   So if you didn't want to drive an 18-wheeler and that would be intimidating to you, although
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.160]   I have to say after doing it for as long as I do, I mean, I feel like it's just a big
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.160]   SUV to me anymore.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.120]   I mean, I'm really used to them.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:44.100]   But if you found an 18-wheeler to be too intimidating, there are other smaller versions of over the
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:49.860]   road life that you could pursue in many ways to pay just as well as an 18-wheeler if not
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:50.860]   better.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.860]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:57.140]   And there are other ways to get into the business as a part-time thing or with less financial
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.660]   risk than buying a multi-hundred thousand dollar semi truck.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:05.740]   So I see guys, I talk to the guys that are running a one-ton pickup truck hauling three
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:06.900]   or four cars.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.580]   You can haul cars.
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:10.940]   You can drive the van and do expedited freight.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.640]   There's all kinds of little niches just like any business and you can find something that
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.900]   fits you and your personality and your goals.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.460]   I talk to some of the expediters.
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:26.420]   You just spot them in a white van usually sitting at a truck stop and just talk to them.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.900]   And some of them really love that lifestyle because they have more free time and they
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:36.460]   don't mind just being at the call of the – they don't mind being all of a sudden sent from
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:41.760]   here to there because they have more free time than perhaps you might as a company driver.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.660]   So there are different ways just like with anything.
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.660]   Well, awesome.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.660]   Ben, tell us about – you have your website for your business in case anybody would like
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:54.300]   to connect with you for your financial planning expertise and also do you want to publish
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.540]   the blog that you guys wrote when you were on the road actively?
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.540]   Yeah, sure.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.540]   I mean that would be fun.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.220]   My wife was the main person to write on that.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.060]   I really – we were just looking through some of her posts yesterday.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.100]   She has such a nice style I think in terms of writing.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.700]   It captures a lot of just the moods that we had in terms of driving and different things.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.460]   So it's been a good memoir of sorts.
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:16.820]   So that blog, I'll let Deb chime in on that because she knows it better than I do.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:22.420]   The web address is trucku42, all spelled out, dot blogspot.com.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:32.580]   So T-R-U-C-K-Y-O-U-F-O-R-T-W-O dot blogspot.com and then for all the trucking posts, it's
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:38.060]   just a backslash trucking and that will hold up or pull up all of the posts that we had
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.060]   for trucking.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:44.380]   So it's a really fun memoir to go back through there and read all of the fun times and the
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.100]   exasperating times because there certainly were lots of those too.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.620]   And then the business is bonafidefinance.com.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.580]   So it's bonafide finance but I have a Latin background.
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:58.340]   I had a minor in Latin and Greek and so it's bonafidefinance.com.
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.740]   You're one of those snobs.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.540]   I still keep up on it actually.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:09.380]   It's not as much as it used to be but I can still read Latin.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:10.380]   That's awesome.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.380]   Well, thank you guys both very much for coming on.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:13.620]   I really appreciate it.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.620]   Yeah, thank you, Joshua.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.500]   So my friends, that's it for today's show.
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.740]   Here's my encouragement to you as we go.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:26.080]   If you're interested in trucking, use some of the information that Ben and Deb have shared
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.420]   with us on today's show.
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.820]   I think it's a legitimate opportunity for a short period of time.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.660]   I meant to ask them if truckers are paying attention to the fact that they're going to
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.220]   be completely out of a career in probably, I guess, a decade with self-driving trucks.
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.100]   But who knows?
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.460]   That's something you can research yourself.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:46.580]   But I should at least just mention, I don't think trucking has a long-term career.
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.540]   They already have the technology.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.740]   Go online if you're not familiar with it.
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:52.620]   They already have the technology for self-driving trucks.
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.700]   Once they get the regulatory environment figured out, the industry will be pressed toward efficiency
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.420]   and many truck drivers will be out of work.
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:02.900]   A lot of hurdles to it still but many truck drivers will be out of work.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:07.620]   However, it is still an opportunity in today's world that many people, many of you might
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:08.820]   want to pursue.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:14.140]   Or take something like this and think about your life goals and think about if there's
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:18.940]   another opportunity that's near to you that would fit your goals.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:23.540]   Is there a way to use something like being an over-the-road truck driver wherein you're
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:28.820]   provided with housing, you're provided with food, you have lower expenses and you can
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.900]   work hard, work a lot and make a lot of money in a short period of time due to a lot of
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.460]   hard work.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:38.820]   Whether you're working on an oil rig up in Bismarck, North Dakota, whether you're driving
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.700]   a truck, whether you're fishing during the summer in Alaska doing salmon fishing or whether
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:48.100]   you're crewing on a freighter somewhere or whatever that type of approach is, you can
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:53.180]   take some of these blue-collar jobs that don't require a lot of experience or a lot of education
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:57.540]   that have some basic entry requirements and you can get into some of these things where
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:02.180]   they allow you to save a substantial amount of money in a short period of time.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:06.760]   Because of that ability to save a lot of money in a short period of time, that fund essentially
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.660]   becomes your freedom fund.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:13.060]   Like from Ben and Deb's experience, if they hadn't spent that time paying off their student
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:16.860]   loans, just imagine two and a half years of work and you come out the other end with $100,000
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.580]   in the bank.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.580]   That's really compelling.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:25.220]   And $100,000 in the bank is enough to take the experience and knowledge that you learned
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:29.000]   from other things and apply it to your own financial freedom.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.700]   Take these ideas and run with them.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:32.820]   That's it for my show.
