[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   I think that there's five camps of voters going into this when Biden was a candidate.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.800]   The first is anything but Biden. The second is anything but Trump. The third is pro-Biden.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.520]   The fourth is pro-Trump. And then the fifth is the other. And I think that that entire
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.080]   bucket of anything but Biden just became available. And it was a pretty sizable bucket.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.640]   There's a large number of voters out there that felt pretty strongly that Biden poses such a
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.520]   significant risk for leadership in this country because of the mental issues and the performance
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.000]   issues that we had seen that as much as people didn't love Trump, they were willing to vote for
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.560]   him because he's not Biden. Now that camp has an option, and that option is Harris. So some
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   percentage of that camp, and I would say probably a super majority of that camp, is now switching
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.520]   into the Harris bucket. The pro-Trump bucket doesn't move. The pro-Biden bucket probably
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.680]   doesn't move. It sticks with Harris. And the anything but Trump bucket doesn't move. It sticks
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.760]   with Harris. The fact that there is probably such a sizable number of voters in the anything but
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.480]   Biden camp is what's probably helping Harris at this point and creates a bit of a handicap for Trump.
