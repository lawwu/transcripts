[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   How do I stay physically attracted to my aging spouse?
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.200]   The question comes our way from an anonymous older man who listens to the podcast.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.740]   "Dear Pastor John, most men marry in their youth when our wives are young, vibrant, physically
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.560]   fit and at their most physically beautiful.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.560]   The passing of time inevitably ushers in wrinkles, sagging skin, sunspots, cellulite, etc.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.720]   As aging husbands, how do we remain physically attracted to our spouse?
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.140]   Should we work at this?
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.000]   Is it disingenuous if it's forced?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.480]   Or is this attraction something that should naturally die off over time?
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.000]   I don't think so.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.620]   However, if I can be fully honest, it often feels like I am brainwashing myself.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.160]   How would you counsel me?"
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.360]   I want to say some things from the Bible and then perhaps from my own experience.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.440]   But first, a brief word just by way of preface.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.020]   I think it'll be obvious why it's relevant, but I'm calling it preface anyway.
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.840]   It absolutely must be said, it seems to me, that we live in a sex-crazed culture.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.240]   Views of beauty are exaggerated, distorted, artificial, disconnected from the reality
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.100]   of true inner beauty.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.960]   Anyone who watches television or movies will almost certainly have a distorted view of
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.040]   beauty and sexuality in our age.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.080]   One way to say it is that sex is vastly overrated.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:55.000]   One of the reasons this happens is because, in fact, in our own bodies, the voice of sexual
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.440]   desire is very loud.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.600]   And the culture we live in creates an echo chamber where that loudness is so great, it
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.960]   virtually drowns out other wonderful voices that are much more important, more precious,
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.800]   more lasting, more essential to our humanity and God's glory than the voice of sexual
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.200]   desire.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.480]   Jesus Christ was the fullest, richest, deepest, most complete human being who ever existed,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.700]   and he never had sexual relations with anyone.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.620]   There are other dimensions to our nature which are infinitely more precious and more crucial
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:53.200]   to our humanity than the screaming force of sexual impulses which silence other voices
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.520]   and deceive us into thinking that this impulse must be gratified.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:09.320]   So all that, just by way of preface to say modern men and women almost inevitably have
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:18.880]   absorbed distorted, deceptive, disproportionate views of sexuality, and that affects our marriages
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.840]   and our growing old together.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.760]   So what does the Bible say?
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:32.880]   Let me give you two texts and put them back to back, one about the wife of our youth and
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.400]   one about the wife of our aging.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:47.200]   Proverbs 5, 19, "Rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely dear, a graceful doe.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.440]   Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.400]   Be intoxicated always with her love.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.080]   Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   an adulteress?"
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.960]   Well, that's pretty clear.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.600]   "Sexual desire is a good thing.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   God made it.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:22.920]   It belongs in the covenant of marriage, and in that place of God-sealed commitment, it
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.640]   can be fully enjoyed for His glory."
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:36.400]   Now here's Malachi 2, verses 13 and 14, and he's asking the question and answering, "Why
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.080]   does the Lord no longer regard our offerings?"
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.400]   And here's what he says, "Because the Lord was witness"—this is in the past now—"The
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.880]   Lord was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless,
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.520]   so she is your companion and your wife by covenant."
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.440]   So time passes.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.400]   She changes.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.200]   You change.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:16.120]   And these men said, "I'm going to get another woman, younger, better skin, better breasts,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.600]   better legs, more desire," and they leave.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.960]   And God hates this.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.480]   And the way Malachi underlines the evil of it is to say three things about her.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.920]   One, "She is your companion."
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.880]   Two, "She is your wife by covenant."
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   Three, "God was witness to this covenant."
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:53.720]   And I want to argue that God as witness, marriage as covenant, wife as companion, have
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:03.840]   explosively powerful, beautiful implications for affection and attraction as we grow old
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.360]   together, if those realities sink in to us as they ought.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.080]   And to that end, here's another text.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.120]   Proverbs 20, 29, "The glory of young men is their strength, but the splendor of old
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.920]   men is their gray hair."
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.080]   Now here's the point.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.760]   Youth and age have different splendors, real splendors, but different splendors.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.800]   There's a strength and a beauty at age 25, but there's also a glory and splendor at age
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.960]   75.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:48.000]   The potential for this season of splendor, this aging season of splendor to awaken affection
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.240]   and desire, I'm arguing, is very different, yet very great.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   Here's two more texts.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:04.640]   2 Corinthians 4, 16, "Though our outer nature, our outer self is wasting away, our inner
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.040]   self is being renewed day by day, for this light momentary affliction is preparing for
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.440]   us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison as we look," here's the important part, "as
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:24.280]   we look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen."
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.920]   So we look not to the things that are seen.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.160]   Our focus is not on the wasting away of our outer beauty and strength.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.280]   Our focus is on the unseen.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.800]   The emphasis of the text, of course, is on future glory, but I'm arguing it also applies
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.020]   to inner glory.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.320]   We don't just look at the things that are seen, we look at the things that are unseen,
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.440]   future glory, inner glory.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:08:00.120]   And I'm saying that this focus has a remarkable power to cause even the weakening outer person
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.320]   to be cherished, desired, touched, embraced.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.560]   Here's 1 Peter 3 to the wives, with huge implications for husbands.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:20.120]   "Do not let your adorning be external, the braiding of hair, the putting on of gold jewelry,
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:28.600]   the clothing that you wear, but let your adorning be the hidden, unseen, the hidden person of
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:36.160]   the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.200]   sight is very precious."
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.240]   There is external beauty that is perishable.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.000]   There is internal beauty that is imperishable.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.160]   The world gets Peter's emphasis exactly backward, and we get sucked into it as we watch and
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   watch and watch.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:06.300]   But my point is, if women are to prioritize inner beauty over outer beauty, then we men,
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:15.240]   we husbands, should grow in our capacities to see and cherish and be moved by, deeply
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:21.840]   moved by, physically moved by that inner beauty.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.920]   So here's my conclusion.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:33.520]   As our bodies move from the passing splendor of youth to the different splendor of age,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:41.200]   we should become better at what we should have been good at all along, namely, instead
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   of our outer appearances dominating the awakening of our affections, inner realities should
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.380]   more and more dominate the awakening of our affections.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:04.920]   And I would put no limits on what those affections or desires might be.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:13.640]   If a husband considers the glory of his marriage covenant, if he considers the wonder that
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:20.680]   God is a glad witness to his covenant and its keeping, if he considers that this woman
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:27.840]   is God's gift and is his companion for life, and that she is a fellow heir of the eternal
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:36.200]   grace, and that her aging is a ripening for the glory of the kingdom where she will shine
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:46.240]   like the sun, I bear witness, Tony, I bear witness that such amazing considerations from
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:56.760]   deep within the aging soul can create perceptions of delight and desire for an aging wife that
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.260]   most twenty-somethings cannot imagine.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:15.120]   So out of this aged mouth, face to face with this once glamorous, now glorious companion
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.200]   come these words, "I love you.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:26.880]   You are my treasure, my crown, my life companion.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.800]   I cherish you.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:38.280]   I have no eyes, no heart for any other, old or young, of all the women in the world.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.060]   I chose you.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.400]   I choose you still.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.320]   I want you.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.120]   You are precious to me.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.560]   I want to be with you, near you.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.440]   I want to touch you and hold you.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.100]   You give me pleasure.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:03.920]   God has been very, very good to me that I could call you mine."
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:12.400]   If that comes from the heart, I don't think a woman would want you to say any more about
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.240]   her looks.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.200]   Really God-centered and countercultural.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.960]   And thank you for listening along.

[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.160]   Well is God's God-centeredness precious to you?
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.380]   This is one of those dividing lines when it comes to theological convictions.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.400]   Do we see and love the fact that God is God-centered?
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.800]   That's the topic next time and I cannot think of a more important topic to address in the
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.800]   podcast.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.640]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.140]   God bless.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.140]   [End]
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:00.140]   1. What is God-centered?
