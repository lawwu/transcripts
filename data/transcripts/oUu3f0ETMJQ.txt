[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.520]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.800]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Samir Hattar
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.600]   as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.680]   Dr. Hattar is the chief of the section
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.600]   on light and circadian rhythms
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.560]   at the National Institute of Mental Health
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.500]   in Bethesda, Maryland.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.120]   Dr. Hattar has many important discoveries to his name.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.720]   He was one of a handful of groups
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.440]   that discovered the light-sensing neurons in the eye
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.560]   that set the circadian clock.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.620]   This was a fundamental discovery made in the early 2000s
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.160]   that has led to an enormous number of additional discoveries
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.120]   on how light regulates our sleep, our immune system,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.440]   our mood, mental health, metabolism, feeding,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.360]   and many other important processes.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.160]   If ever there was somebody who understands
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.680]   how all of these processes interact
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.600]   and can inform best practices for our daily behaviors,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.140]   it's Dr. Hattar.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.460]   During our discussion today,
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.780]   Dr. Hattar answers questions that are absolutely essential
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.840]   for us to know about our health and wellbeing.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.300]   For instance, how to align our sleep schedule
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.940]   with our activity schedule, such as exercise,
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.720]   and how to align light activity and exercise
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.660]   with our feeding rhythms.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.060]   He presents a new model of how light activity
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.240]   and feeding rhythms converge to support optimal health,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.220]   and when those are not aligned correctly,
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.960]   how our mental and physical health can suffer.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.240]   It's a discussion that is rich with scientific mechanism,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.280]   made clearly, of course, so everybody can understand,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.720]   as well as specific protocols to deal with shifts
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260]   in day length, shifts in activity,
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.720]   and in order to optimize sleep, metabolism,
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.600]   and wellbeing of various kinds.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.200]   I learned so much from Samer, as I always do.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.520]   He is an absolute wealth of knowledge
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.280]   on all things related to light and circadian rhythms,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.320]   physiology, and neuroscience.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.720]   I don't think you'll find anyone else
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.040]   as knowledgeable about these topics as Samer,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.920]   and so I'm delighted that he joined us here on the podcast
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.460]   to share this information.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.920]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.720]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.400]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.000]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.120]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.960]   Our first sponsor is Roka.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.120]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.440]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.160]   I've spent my career working on the science
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.440]   of the visual system, and I can tell you that one
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.700]   of the things that our visual system has to contend with
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.880]   is adjusting so that when we go from a very bright area
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.160]   to a dim or shadowed area, we can still see things clearly.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.520]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.360]   with the science of the visual system in mind,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.080]   and so they make those transitions seamless.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.360]   You always see things with crystal clarity.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.760]   Another great thing about these glasses
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.880]   is that they're very lightweight,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.160]   so you don't even really remember that they're on your face,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.840]   and they won't slip off if you get sweaty.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.760]   The glasses were designed initially for running
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.080]   and for cycling and for active wear,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.840]   but they work great for that, and they work great,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.120]   and they also happen to look great for work,
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.760]   if you go out to dinner, for social settings,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.960]   so they can really be worn in essentially any circumstances.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.600]   If you'd like to try Roka glasses, you can go to Roka,

[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.820]   That's Roka.com, enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.800]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.300]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.880]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.620]   to help you better understand your body
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.660]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.680]   I've long been a believer in getting blood work done
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.040]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.240]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.720]   can only be detected in a quality blood test.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.800]   The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.700]   is you get numbers back, but you don't know what to do
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.420]   about those numbers specifically.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.860]   Roka solved that problem at a number of levels.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.480]   First of all, they make getting the blood tests very easy.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.600]   They'll come to your house if you like,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.960]   you can go to a local clinic.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.060]   Second of all, once you get your numbers back,
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.320]   there's a very easy to use dashboard
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.360]   where you can identify obviously what the numbers are,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.820]   but also the various things that you can do
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.700]   to bring those numbers into the ranges that you want
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.560]   through either behavioral practices like exercise,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.440]   through nutritional practices or supplementation, et cetera.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.220]   So they made the whole thing very easy start to finish
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.640]   in a way that allows you to best direct your health goals.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.040]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.640]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.780]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.360]   Magic Spoon is a zero sugar grain-free keto friendly cereal.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.160]   I am not ketogenic,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.560]   meaning I don't follow a purely ketogenic diet.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   I tend to fast in the early part of the day.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.560]   I tend to eat kind of low carb-ish
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.040]   through the middle of the day.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.800]   And then in the evening I eat carbohydrates.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.280]   That's what works best for me
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.300]   and allows me to feel alert all day long
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.800]   and to sleep really well at night.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.900]   Magic Spoon is a terrific snack for me
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.560]   because it tastes terrific.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.680]   It's got some sweetness,
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.800]   but it doesn't take me out of that state
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.060]   that I want to be in during the day
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.020]   where I'm sort of keto-ish, I would say.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.600]   I'm not actually in ketosis,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.820]   but I'm following more or less a low carb diet
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.660]   during the day, which keeps me alert.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.900]   So either fasting or low carb,
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.060]   and Magic Spoon is consistent with that.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.760]   And then as I mentioned before in the evening,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.860]   I do eat carbohydrates.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.320]   Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.020]   13 to 14 grams of protein,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.840]   and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.660]   So I think it qualifies as low carb-ish or low carb.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.080]   In addition, it only has 140 calories per serving.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.360]   It's also just delicious.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.320]   They have flavors like cocoa, fruity, peanut butter,
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.600]   frosted, I particularly like the frosted one
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.720]   because it tastes like donuts
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.160]   and I particularly like donuts,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.920]   although I try not to eat them too often, if ever.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.440]   If you want to try Magic Spoon,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.380]   you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.520]   to grab a variety pack.

[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.640]   And now my conversation with Dr. Samer Hatar.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.240]   Samer, thanks for sitting down with me.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.080]   - My pleasure.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.440]   - Yeah, we go way back.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.760]   So you are best known in scientific circles
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.320]   for your work on how light impacts mood,
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.040]   learning, feeding, hunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.400]   So just to kick the ball out onto the field, so to speak,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.600]   how does light impact the way we feel?
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.740]   So when I get up in the morning,
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.760]   I have the opportunity to interact with light
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.220]   in certain ways or to avoid light in certain ways.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.120]   I have the opportunity to interact with sunlight
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.000]   or with artificial light.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.560]   Maybe you could just wade us into what the relationship is
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.640]   between light and these things
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.080]   like mood and hunger, et cetera.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.200]   - Sure.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.080]   So I mean, you do appreciate the effect of light for vision.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.840]   So when you wake up in a beautiful area, beautiful ocean,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.240]   light is essential.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.120]   The sunrise, the sunset, blue sky, beautiful mountains.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.140]   So that's your conscious perception of light.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.720]   But light has a completely different aspect
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.360]   that is independent of conscious vision
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.480]   or image-forming functions.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.120]   And that's how it regulates
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.680]   many important functions in your body.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.940]   I think the best that is well-studied and well-known
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.960]   is your circadian clock.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.660]   And the word circadian comes from the word circa,
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.200]   which is approximate, and dn is day.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.600]   So it's an approximate day.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.520]   Why is it an approximate day?
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.080]   Because if I put you or any other human being
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.920]   who have a normal circadian clock in a constant conditions
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.900]   with no information about feeding time, about sleep time,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.080]   about what time it is outside,
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.880]   you still have a daily rhythm,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.800]   but it's not exactly 24 hours.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.000]   So it will shift out of the solar day
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.840]   because it's not exactly 24 hours
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.340]   and hence the name circadian.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.400]   - So just to ask a quick question about that,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.760]   when you say you have this about 24-hour rhythm,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.820]   how does that rhythm show up in the tissues of our body?
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.520]   - Great, so great question.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.200]   So it shows up at every level that we know we studied.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.480]   It shows up at the level of the cell,
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.320]   it shows up at the level of the tissue,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.120]   and it shows up at your behavior.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.360]   The most obvious for you is your sleep-wake cycle.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.680]   You sleep and you're awake and sleep at the 24-hour rhythms.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.720]   And if you measure the sleep-wake cycle
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.520]   for humans who are maintaining constant conditions,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.040]   you will see that the period length of the sleep rhythm,
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.640]   on average, is more than 24 hours.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.840]   In humans, it's 24.2 hours.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.240]   So you'll be drifting 0.2 hours every day
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.540]   out of the solar day if you don't get the sunlight.
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.520]   So the sunlight adjusts that approximate day
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.040]   to an exact day, so now your behavior is adjusted
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.020]   to the light-dark environment or the solar day.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.640]   - Okay, so if I understand correctly,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.280]   if I were to go into a cave or I were to be
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.880]   in constant light and I didn't close my eyes
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.040]   in constant light, that I would still sleep
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.540]   in one coherent bout and I would still be awake
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.520]   for more or less one coherent bout, maybe a nap.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.520]   But the total duration of my day, so to speak,
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.840]   would be a little bit longer than 24 hours.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   But if I'm in a condition like most people are,
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.040]   where the sun goes up and the sun goes down
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.120]   and I have some understanding of that sunrise and sunset--
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.840]   - You don't have to have the understanding.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.580]   You don't have to have conscious understanding.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.160]   You have the detection.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.680]   So circadian photoentrainment is the word we use
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.260]   in training the circadian clock to the photic environment.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.920]   It's completely subconscious.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.100]   You're not aware of it.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.760]   It's not like vision or image forming
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.840]   where you actually know what you're looking at.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.400]   So it's all hypothalamic.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.560]   It's part of the brain that is not consciously driven.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.720]   So you actually do not know when it happens
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.700]   or when it doesn't happen.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.120]   And that's what we'll get into when I tell you
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.400]   why light affects your mood and why sometimes
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.160]   people don't know how to deal with light
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.240]   to improve their mood, for example.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.320]   - Okay, so this is a subconscious vision.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.360]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.640]   Before you tell us about how light impacts mood,
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.200]   I'm curious, what is the relevance of adjusting
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   this clock from a little bit longer
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.040]   than 24 hours to 24 hours?
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.440]   I mean, it seems like a small difference.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.000]   24 hours and 40 minutes or 24 hours?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.400]   Like, what's the relevance?
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.320]   I mean, why should we care about that short difference?
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.400]   - So let's do the math.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.560]   If you shift out 0.2 hours a day,
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.520]   in five days you're shifting out one hour.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.120]   So you're literally one hour off
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.480]   in your social behavior in five days.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.560]   In 10 days, you're two hours off.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.600]   And if you're an organism that is living in the wild,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.100]   shifting out of the right phase of the cycle,
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.920]   you could either miss food or you could become food.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.000]   So it's really essential for survival.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.600]   I think it's one of the strongest aspect of survival
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.680]   for animals to have the anticipation
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.440]   and the adjustment to the solar cycle.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.840]   - And for humans as well, when you say animals,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.880]   I'm assuming that applies to us.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.200]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.040]   - I see.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.640]   So even though it's just a short bit longer than 24,
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.320]   if that accumulates over days,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.880]   then you could find yourself very much out of phase
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.520]   with the rest of your species, essentially.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.400]   - So let's say it's 0.2 hours.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.800]   So in five days, it's one hour.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.400]   In 25 days, it could be five or six hours.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.260]   You could be in New York and you're feeling
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.160]   as if you traveled from New York to London.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.360]   So you will be having jet lag in New York,
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.760]   even though you didn't do a jet lag travel.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.640]   So it's very important for the adjustment.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.920]   And if we have time, maybe we could talk about
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.960]   why this is important for seasonality,
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.780]   because also it allows animals
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.280]   to anticipate the change in season.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.320]   And the more you're high in the north or the south,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.220]   the more that these weather changes occur very harshly
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.100]   and you have to be ready for them.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.080]   And that happens in us as well.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.880]   - All right, well, we will definitely get into seasonality.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.560]   Okay, so we've got this subconscious vision
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.440]   that aligns us with the turn of the earth.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.640]   How does that work?
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.640]   What is the machinery that allows that to happen?
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.840]   And how does that machinery work?
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.960]   - Yeah, so we knew that in mammals, including us,
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.520]   we are mammals, humans,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.480]   that the eyes are required for this function.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.300]   So if humans are born without eyes
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.360]   or the optic nerves are damaged,
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.800]   humans are not able to adjust to the solar cycle.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.040]   So we know that the eyes are required.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.800]   And since we thought we knew about the eyes a lot
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.640]   before 2000, we thought that-
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.280]   - What did you say, before the year 2000?
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.000]   - Before the year 2000, yes.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.680]   We thought it's these photoreceptors in your retina
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.680]   that allow you to see.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.620]   So in the human retinas,
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.120]   there are two types of photoreceptors.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.360]   They are called rods and cones because of their shapes.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.360]   And these rods and cones simply take the photon energy,
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.040]   which light is made of,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.640]   and they change it in a way to an electrical signal
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.360]   that allow us to build the image of the environment
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.480]   in our cortices.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.520]   - Subconsciously?
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.920]   - Consciously, in this situation, 'cause it's vision, right?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.120]   It's image forming vision.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.520]   It's a visual cortex and associative cortices,
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.560]   which allow you to build conscious perception
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.320]   of the environment.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.860]   However, people have found,
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.280]   including me with the work of David Berson
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.480]   and Ignacio Provencio,
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.520]   that there is a subset of ganglion cells.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.760]   The ganglion cells are the cells that leave the retina,
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.720]   their axon, leave the retina, and project to the brain.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.360]   So these words are stored to only relay
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.760]   rod and cone information from the light environment
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.040]   to the brain.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.480]   We found that a small subset of these ganglion cells
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.720]   are themselves photoreceptors that were completely missed
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.980]   in the retina.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.060]   And these are the photoreceptors
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.120]   that relay light environment subconsciously
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.980]   to the areas in the brain that have and house
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.060]   the circadian clock or the circadian pacemaker,
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.520]   which adjusts all the clocks in our bodies
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.800]   to the central brain clock that allows them to entrain
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.300]   to the 24 hour light dark cycle.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.040]   - Incredible, so in the year, as I recall,
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.520]   'cause I was a graduate student at the time,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.420]   in the year 2000, there was this landmark discovery
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.960]   made by you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson, and others,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.320]   that these cells exist that can communicate
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.680]   day and night information to the brain
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.440]   in this very small subset of cells.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.200]   Since then, I've heard, but maybe you can confirm or refute,
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.880]   that this system that connects the eyes
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.340]   to the rest of the brain
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.300]   is actually the most ancient form of vision,
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.200]   that this is probably the form of vision
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.480]   that some early version of human beings had
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.080]   before they had pattern vision,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.640]   before they could see colors and shapes
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.420]   and motion and all that.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:11.340]   And that the same cells that perform this role
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.820]   are actually similar to insect eyes.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.480]   I think I heard David Berson say once
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.040]   that we actually have a little bit of the fly eye
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.900]   in our eye, what's he talking about?
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.460]   - Yeah, so it's really interesting actually,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.060]   because these same IPRGCs we discovered,
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.520]   they contribute a little bit to image formation
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.360]   and now work from Tiffany Schmidt,
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.160]   specifically have proven that they do contribute
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.240]   to image forming functions.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.160]   But they contribute to very
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.960]   limited aspect of image formation.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.640]   So it fits your hypothesis
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.800]   that these are an ancient photoreceptors.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.640]   The other thing that adds to that hypothesis
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.140]   is that they are expressed in cells
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.040]   that don't have any modification
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.100]   that make them look like photoreceptors.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.340]   So the photoreceptors that I told you about
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.840]   that are important for vision, image formation,
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.380]   they have very specialized structures
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.680]   that allow them to pack these structures
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.080]   with photopigments, these are the photo detecting proteins,
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.160]   so they could detect a high sensitivity of photons
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.680]   that pass through them.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.200]   These new photoreceptors don't have
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.420]   these specialized structures.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.460]   So they just really need a lot of light at the time.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.100]   We thought they need a lot of light to be activated.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.100]   So that's why we think they are ancient
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.420]   and that's why I think they adjust to ancient functions
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.780]   that are as important as regulating your body,
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.260]   circadian clock to the solar environment,
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.180]   to solar day or to the light dark cycle.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.280]   - So you mentioned IPRGCs, intrinsically photosensitive.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.060]   So these are cells that connect the eye of the brain
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.340]   that behave like photoreceptors essentially.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.740]   And then you mentioned melanopsin,
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.580]   which is the actual pigment that converts the light
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.560]   into the electrical signal more or less.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.260]   And my understanding is that melanopsin
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.180]   was identified first in frog melanophores.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.100]   So does that mean that we have like little pieces
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.020]   of frog skin in our eyes?
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.980]   - So honestly, David Berson say you have a fly in your eye
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.500]   because it sounds better.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.020]   The more accurate I think
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.060]   is that you have a frog skin in your eye.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.660]   It's not as catchy, but really melanopsin,
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.260]   really the name melanopsin is from melanocyte opsin.
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.260]   So it's melanopsin
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.700]   because it was found in the frog melanocytes.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.300]   You know the frogs can change their color depending on light
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.740]   and melanopsin drives this response.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.980]   So when Ignacio Provencio first discovered
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.820]   these opsins in frogs,
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.580]   luckily he was smart enough to see
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.740]   if they are expressed in the frog eye.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.380]   They were expressed in the frog eye
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.820]   and it what appears to be retinal ganglion cells,
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.460]   which I told you the one that connect the eye to the brain.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.300]   He had the insight to go and see
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.620]   if they are expressed in the monkey eye.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.420]   And he found that they are also expressed
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.780]   in what appears to be retinal ganglion cells.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.480]   And really that what opened the field wide open.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.920]   Then David Berson did the seminal experiment
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.180]   where he went to the brain where the central oscillator,
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.860]   the oscillator that drives circadian rhythm in the brain
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.820]   called the suprachiasmatic nucleus
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.980]   that has been known for many years to receive retinal input.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.300]   And he labeled the cells that project there.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.260]   And then he found that even if you destroy rods and cones,
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.540]   you could get light responses from these cells.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.340]   So you could imagine he nearly fainted
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.700]   when he saw that these cells can respond independent
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.700]   completely in the absence of rod and cone input.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.800]   - I'll never forget reading those papers in 2000, 2001.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.500]   I was at the meeting in DC when Ignacio,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.540]   we call him Iggy,
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.020]   showed this image of this basically what is frog melanophores
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.220]   in the human eye.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.700]   And everyone was like, "Oh my goodness, this is the thing."
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.620]   And I want to get into how light
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.240]   actually can control circadian rhythms at the moment.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.320]   But I think it's worth mentioning now
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.120]   that people who are pattern vision blind,
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.960]   so people who cannot see and no conscious vision,
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.620]   but have eyes, many of them still have these cells,
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.080]   these melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells,
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.240]   and can essentially match or entrain, as we say,
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.000]   onto the light-dark cycle.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   - In fact, they possibly have no problems
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.400]   in circadian photo entrainment.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.560]   They'll have enormous sleep-wake cycle.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.580]   - But they're totally blind.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.140]   - But they are totally image blind.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.620]   And what's really interesting is that,
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.480]   and this story I heard from Chuck Sizler,
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.820]   so I'll give him credit,
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.200]   that some of these people who are image blind,
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.620]   usually they get dry eyes and they give them a lot of pain.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.360]   And doctors used to think,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.240]   "Oh, since they are image blind
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.400]   and they're getting dry eye,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.060]   why don't you just remove their eyes?
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.640]   They're not using them anymore."
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.960]   And the minute they would remove their eyes,
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.200]   they start having cyclical sleep problems,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.720]   indicating that now they are not entraining
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.580]   to the light-dark cycle and are having cyclical jet lags
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.960]   when their clock shifts through the light-dark cycle.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.920]   - That's really interesting.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.480]   And I hear from a number of blind people,
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.560]   in my various aspects of my job,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.440]   and a lot of them have issues with sleep,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.960]   I think in part because they don't realize
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.540]   that they too need to see light
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.160]   at particular times of day or night
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.840]   in order to match their schedule.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.280]   Well, I think that's a perfect segue for us
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.280]   to talk about how light and viewing light
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.540]   can impact our sleep-wake rhythms.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.120]   And then we will move into some of the other ways
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.320]   in which light can impact other forms of bodily function.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.240]   - Yeah, so I love the way you set it up
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   because one of the most interesting and difficult aspect
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.520]   of trying to educate people about light effect
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.800]   on subconscious vision is that it's subconscious.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.200]   So we're all aware of what we think is intensity
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.580]   because we see the room.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.400]   But if you talk to people who know how to take photographs
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.560]   and stuff like that,
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.140]   they know that the intensity varies greatly.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.100]   But our system, because we have to see the same way
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.140]   in very bright conditions and very dim conditions,
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.080]   we're not very good at estimating intensity consciously.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.440]   So when you try to tell people about intensity,
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.600]   you really struggle because they think they know intensities
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.680]   but they really don't.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.720]   - You mean light intensity.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.760]   - Light intensity.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.880]   So that the cones themselves have an incredible ability
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.480]   to adapt to different light conditions.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.520]   So you can see at all different conditions,
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.880]   otherwise it'd be a disaster.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.000]   You know, if you don't change the setting on your camera
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.040]   and you go from inside the room to the outside,
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.640]   it becomes completely white, you don't see anything.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.000]   So if your cones don't adapt to the environment,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.560]   then you're not gonna be able to see in this room
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.000]   and on the beach, right?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.200]   But the problem is your IPRGCs,
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.400]   the cells that we talked about,
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.600]   they measure intensity pretty well.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.380]   They really know what intensity is.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.240]   They have a very good linear measurement of intensity.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.880]   They don't adapt as well,
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.480]   they don't adapt actually that much, to be honest.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.320]   So that tells you that subconsciously the system is used
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.520]   to measuring light intensity in a natural environment.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.800]   Because when you're in a natural environment,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.120]   you don't have industrialized lighting,
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.520]   then your system is functioning very well.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.120]   But now when we change these environments,
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.640]   we could really mess up ourselves.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.440]   So you have to teach people how to understand intensity.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.960]   And that's something that you have to explain to people.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   And I think I love to do it myself.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.240]   I do it in what is called the lowest amount of light
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.520]   required to allow you to see comfortably.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.460]   So you have to do this as a fun experiment.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.760]   - Okay, so explain to me how this goes.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.600]   And maybe we could break it up in the day
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.880]   into three or four parts.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.720]   So let's say, assuming that most people wake up
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.560]   in the morning, as opposed to night shift workers, et cetera,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.680]   we could talk about later.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.500]   But they wake up in the morning,
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.880]   so let's divide the day into quarters.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.040]   What is the proper way to interact with light
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.640]   in the first part of the day?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.880]   - So I honestly think the easiest thing is waking up.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.340]   Get as much light as you can.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.200]   - Into your eyes.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.460]   - Yeah, it's really nice.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.840]   Your system is primed.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.880]   If you're in trained, it's primed to get light.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.640]   The sun should be out.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.040]   Most animals in the wild,
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.280]   they actually seem to track the sun.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.720]   The sun has a huge influence on life on earth.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.880]   It's actually, life on earth is because of sun.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.040]   So that's easy.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.000]   In the morning, when you wake up, you need light.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.040]   - Okay, so what is the behavioral practice
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.960]   that you recommend?
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.120]   Does it, let's say somebody is in a condition
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.940]   where there's a lot of cloud cover,
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.600]   is it important to get outside?
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.900]   - So I have to tell you, the cloudiest day
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.120]   is gonna be much more brighter than your room.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.320]   You could ask any photographer.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.460]   A cloudy day, unless it's really dark, dark clouds,
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.800]   usually cloudy days have much more bright outside
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.840]   than inside the room,
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.740]   even when you have good lighting inside the room.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.960]   So I think in the outside is usually,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.560]   even when it's cloudy, you're gonna get enough intensity
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.740]   to help you adjust your cycle to the day/night cycle.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.000]   - So how long do you, these are general rules of thumb,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.200]   but how long do you recommend people go outside?
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.920]   - So if you do it daily, you possibly need very,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.680]   if you do it daily, because remember,
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.480]   this thing is gonna happen on a daily matter.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.520]   - So it's like, so the clock is tracking it
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.760]   on a regular basis. - Absolutely.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.600]   It's photon counting, it's tracking,
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.680]   I would say 15 minutes.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.600]   If you don't do it daily, you may wanna increase it.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.720]   And we'll talk about when you travel what you could do.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.960]   But yeah, 15 minutes should be fun.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.840]   You do it more, it doesn't hurt.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.120]   - And through a window, my understanding is
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.440]   that through a window, it dramatically decreases
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.880]   the amount of light energy coming in.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.040]   - It depends of how thick the windows are
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.720]   and how dark they are.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.440]   But it's also nice to go outside and to feel the season.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.040]   - Sunglasses off.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.400]   - I don't use sunglasses.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.700]   - Yeah, but you have your Jordanian photo pigment.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.120]   Whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right?
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.200]   But I personally, you know, if I'm in the shade
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.880]   or if it's not incredibly bright, I try to,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.580]   especially in the morning, but I'm also an early person.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.160]   So we have to differentiate between early--
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.220]   - What time do you wake up?
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.840]   - I wake up at 4.30 in the morning.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.120]   - But the sun isn't out yet? - It's not out yet.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:10.960]   - So what do you do?
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.120]   You turn on artificial lights?
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.160]   - I usually don't turn on artificial light
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.520]   because I know the sun is gonna come up eventually.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.960]   But that's why I don't like the change
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.520]   in the timing that they do.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.720]   - Wait, but what do you do between 4.30 a.m. and 7 a.m.?
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.280]   - I mean, I just got my computer and my phone,
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.720]   so possibly I get enough light.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.980]   But in reality, I mean, as long as you let your body
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.820]   get the morning sunlight, which I think is really,
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.080]   to me, and there is no evidence, but to me,
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.840]   this is, if you look at all animals, plants,
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.360]   this morning sunlight seems to be very important.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.380]   And I, you know, we don't have experiments to show it,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.580]   but I have a gut feeling that it has
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.680]   a huge impact on humans.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.360]   - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab at the Stanford Sleep Lab
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.120]   has shown that these early morning light flashes
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.640]   can adjust the total amount of sleep
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.120]   that one will get, makes it easier to get into sleep.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:02.960]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.960]   - Okay, so--
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.240]   - And Ken Wright also did this beautiful camping experiments
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.080]   that showed that--
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.600]   - Right, maybe you should describe those
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.840]   'cause those are beautiful experiments.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.160]   - They are beautiful experiments.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.900]   He took these, you know, college students
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.640]   that had the late onset of sleep and late waking time,
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.160]   and then he said, let's go camping and just don't use
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.580]   any artificial light and you could go to sleep as late
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.280]   or as early as you want and wake up as late as early.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.000]   And he found a huge shift in their sleep pattern
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.400]   just by exposing them to the light-dark cycle.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.560]   I mean, so--
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.660]   - And it lasted.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.500]   - And it lasted.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.320]   - Even after they came back.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.160]   - Exactly.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:40.980]   - I think it was two days of camping,
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.820]   reset the circadian clock.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.960]   - Seven days, but it lasted, yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.760]   Yeah, it's really incredible.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.400]   - Okay, so get bright light of some sort early in the day,
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.760]   ideally sunlight, even on a cloudy day,
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.720]   it's going to be brighter than indoor light.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.580]   - So that's easy.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.600]   - Okay, so then--
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.060]   - And the other thing that I would like to mention to people,
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.400]   if you think it's very dim outside,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.560]   let's say it's very cloudy, stay longer.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.300]   So remember, intensity is only one component.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.620]   Duration is also important because remember
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.960]   that the circadian system is not like the image system.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.340]   In the image system, you have to change every second
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.980]   because you're looking at different objects.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.040]   You have to change your perception.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.120]   But for the circadian system, it's trying to figure out
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.920]   where am I in the day/night cycle.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.000]   So the more you give them the information,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   the better you are.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.520]   So if it's very bright, you don't need a lot
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.680]   because it's clearly going to make you fire like crazy.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.640]   But if it's not bright, stay longer.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.680]   Stay for one hour, have your coffee outside
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.700]   or something like that.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.180]   It's just going to help.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.040]   - I think you said something extremely important,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.420]   which is that this circadian system is trying to figure out
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.860]   when you are in time, not where you are in space.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.540]   - Sorry, I said where you are in time, I meant when you are.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.700]   - Oh no, no, I wasn't correcting you.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.060]   I just meant that, I think fundamentally,
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.860]   that's the incredible thing about this system,
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.780]   that you have this clock, this 24-hour clock in your brain,
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.560]   but it needs to be synchronized to the outside.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.840]   So could we go a little deeper
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.460]   into this circadian setting behavior
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.340]   and come up with some general rules of thumb?
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.260]   So let's say it's a very bright day, extremely bright.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.540]   No clouds, sun's out.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.820]   You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.020]   - And I'll tell you, if you're sensitive,
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.720]   you don't even have to go in the sun.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.120]   You could be in the shade.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.240]   There's going to be so many photons out there in the shade.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.320]   It's going to be perfect.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.380]   You don't even have to see the sun.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.140]   You don't have to have the sun.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.300]   It's great for vitamin D, that's a different story.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.180]   You could do this for your skin and protect your skin.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.820]   That's not my area of expertise.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.780]   But for that effect on the circadian system,
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.980]   as long as you're outside in the shade and it's sunny day,
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.580]   10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.280]   - Okay, and then let's say it's kind of overcast.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.980]   It's not particularly bright or there's solid cloud cover,
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.300]   but obviously the sun is out, but it's not as bright.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.380]   How long do you think it would take to set the clock?
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.340]   - 10 to 15 should be sufficient.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.780]   Stay for half an hour, stay for 45 minutes.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.540]   If it's very dark cloud, yeah, stay for longer.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.600]   - Okay, and if for some reason one finds themselves
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.600]   very far north and it's very, very dense cloud cover,
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.020]   how long and at what point should somebody consider
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.200]   using an artificial light source to mimic the sunlight?
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.560]   - Yeah, honestly, this is where we don't have
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.940]   a lot of information still, because this is where
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.220]   we're gonna discuss this maybe in more detail,
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.060]   that if you put humans in artificial conditions,
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.580]   the circadian system is very sensitive to light.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.860]   But in reality, in the real environment,
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.620]   light also is affecting other aspects that are independent
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.680]   of the setting of the circadian basemaker.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.000]   And these which we call the direct effect of light
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.960]   on mood, for example.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.060]   So that is very hard to figure out what intensity
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.340]   you need to use, and we haven't done enough experiments
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.940]   'cause the system has been discovered just recently.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.020]   But I would say if you use bright light in the morning,
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.620]   and I mean, it's hard for me to give numbers,
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.140]   it can get complicated.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.120]   But yeah, I mean, if you're, honestly,
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.480]   if you're that far north and you're in the winter
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.620]   and you wanna get, make sure you don't use these light boxes,
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.780]   I would suggest that personally, but that's it.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.740]   - I use, it's actually not designed for circadian setting,
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.940]   but I have a 930 lux light pad that I bought,
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.060]   and I bought it, they're very affordable
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.860]   compared to the Dawn simulating lights,
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.460]   which are quite expensive, frankly.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.960]   And I put it there, and so I just basically,
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.000]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.900]   I use that until the sun comes out.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.180]   And then I make sure once the sun is out, I go outside.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.280]   But I keep that thing on all day.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.100]   And I don't know if that's good or bad.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.100]   Is it good or bad?
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.340]   - I honestly, I don't think being exposed to bright light
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.820]   in the day is going to ever be bad.
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.740]   Because really, if you're outside in the day,
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.100]   unless, you know, the worst is gonna happen
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.660]   if the temperature is very high,
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.340]   your body's gonna say don't dehydrate and go to sleep.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.940]   So you could tell actually sometimes when it's very hot,
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.820]   the more you get exposed to bright light,
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.740]   the sleepier you feel in the afternoon,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.260]   which is counterintuitive.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.020]   So--
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.340]   - And that's to protect us, you think, against dehydration?
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.020]   - I think if you think about the human evolution
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.420]   from near the equator in the,
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.660]   between noon and a certain time in the afternoon,
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.640]   it would have been very hard for you to maintain
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.660]   physiological homeostatic function,
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.740]   being active at this very high temperature time.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.100]   So I think napping was a way,
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.100]   that's why I think it has a major function,
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.140]   which is still, napping was a way to somehow
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.220]   take you away from that dangerous zone.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.860]   And maybe that's why people in the north,
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.140]   they say in the winter we can't wake up in the morning
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.720]   'cause they don't have this long light,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.320]   so they sleep it more at night.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.380]   But in the summer they say we feel like we can't go to sleep,
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.960]   we have to put all these dark curtains.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   So I think venturing that much up north
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.660]   has been, came up with problem because evolution
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.120]   was used to a certain light environment
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.380]   that was completely changed with a human,
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.360]   with other animals I think that lived there longer.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.740]   They have come up with very interesting adaptation
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.180]   of actually measuring even very small changes
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:29.060]   in the light intensities that still occur.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.320]   So even if you're near the poles,
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.940]   even though it's always light,
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.040]   but there is a change in the light intensity
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.200]   across the day and night cycle.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.060]   So your system, if it's linear,
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.860]   and remember I told you that IPRGCs are incredibly linear,
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.500]   can still measure, oh, this is lower light than higher light
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.780]   if the organism has the ability to do that.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.020]   - I see, it's interesting, I've spent so much time
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.580]   learning from you, fortunately, about these cells,
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.060]   and yet I never really appreciated until now
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.180]   how on the one hand they are tracking the amount of light
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.420]   to understand when we are in time
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.820]   relative to the 24 hour cycle,
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.420]   but also that you keep mentioning
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.860]   this linear measurement of intensity,
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.860]   that they really are trying to figure out
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.500]   when we are in time by measuring the intensity of light.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.900]   And of course the sun is the most intense source
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.020]   of light available to us.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.180]   So, okay, so I think we've nailed down
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.900]   that first part of the day.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.600]   Basically it's got 10 to 30 minutes,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.020]   depending on how bright it is,
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.420]   and try and do that as often as possible
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.620]   to give the system a regular--
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.460]   - Daily is the best.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.880]   This system is really about, and you'll see that
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.460]   even for the effect on depression,
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.560]   it's about multiple days.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.540]   So you don't have to worry if you missed it one day,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.540]   stay longer if you want, but if you're in a hurry
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.140]   and you want to do other stuff,
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.980]   that's a great recommendation.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.980]   So you might want to compensate with some extra time
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.740]   if you missed a day or two.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.900]   And this is why I've heard you say before,
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.940]   it's entirely possible to get severely jet lagged
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:33:59.880]   without traveling.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.720]   - Absolutely.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.000]   - Simply by staying in, being on your phone too much,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:03.980]   not getting the sunlight.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.060]   - And you saw this during the pandemic.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.740]   A lot of people mentioned that their sleep-wake cycles
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.980]   suffered a lot, because if you're not going out,
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.380]   and if you're staying at home and you don't have big windows
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.740]   and you're waking late, waking up late,
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.580]   and then you're using very bright light till late at night,
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.220]   your body's gonna shift.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.460]   And now your day is gonna start,
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.620]   instead of like really when the sun comes up,
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.340]   let's say at six o'clock in the morning,
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.860]   it's gonna, your day's gonna start
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.100]   at 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.700]   That's what your body's gonna think
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.820]   is the beginning of the day.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.380]   So then you're not gonna be able to sleep
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.180]   at 10 o'clock at night, because now that's really,
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.380]   for your body, is completely different timing.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.060]   And you could see this happen during the pandemic
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.540]   at a very high scale.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.700]   People get delayed in their sleep-wake cycle a lot.
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.940]   - And there is this idea of chronotypes
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.140]   that we all each intrinsically have a best rhythm
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.980]   of either being a morning person,
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.580]   you called yourself an early person,
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.860]   or a night owl, or more of a kind of standard,
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.980]   to bed around 10, 30, up around seven type thing.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.300]   And I think there are now good data,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.820]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.500]   from the National Institutes of Mental Health
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.020]   and elsewhere showing that the more we deviate
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.260]   from that intrinsic rhythm, the more mental health issues
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.140]   and physical health issues start to crop up.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.940]   - So there is great data on this,
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.140]   and there is a couple of things that complicate this.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.500]   The first is the people who usually are late,
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.980]   they tell you that the society doesn't accommodate.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.940]   - What, by late, what do you mean?
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.540]   People that wake up late and go to sleep late?
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.580]   - Go to sleep late and wake up late.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.020]   They have an overwhelmingly higher level
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.500]   of depression and failures.
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.880]   I mean, clearly, I mean, the reason that people say
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.400]   sleep early, wake up early, you're better,
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.560]   because human notice that people who wake up,
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.300]   go to sleep early and wake up early,
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.280]   they do better in life, they notice that.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.340]   - They just perform better.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.920]   - They perform, but the question is,
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.440]   is that intrinsic to the system, or is that society,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.720]   because society start things usually early,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.040]   or late, that's a hard question to ask.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.940]   - We discriminate against late risers.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.640]   - In a way, we discriminate, right?
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.960]   But the other explanation is Ken Wright's experiment.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   These late riser, if they were truly chronotypically late,
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.720]   why would they shift so easily when you put them in the,
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.940]   if you were really chronotypically late,
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.180]   and there is a phase relation between
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.820]   the light-dark environment and your circadian clock,
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.580]   then doing this camping experiment
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.460]   should not have caused much changes,
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:37.260]   because it's not that light is gonna affect you
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.580]   in a certain way, it's that this is the relationship
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.460]   that your body decided, that I'm a late sleeper,
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:47.060]   late waking, so I'm honestly, I'm still unable
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.300]   to figure out how much of this late waking up
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.600]   is controlled by the light environment,
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.820]   and how much is intrinsic.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.840]   I'm sure there are differences,
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.540]   but are they as big as we see in the environment?
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.800]   Because you have people that go up to sleep at 7 p.m.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.220]   and wake up at 1 a.m., these are clearly advanced phase.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.020]   - So people that go to sleep at 7 p.m.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.060]   and wake up at 1 a.m. and feel good doing that.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.740]   - I'm not so sure they feel good,
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.800]   but a lot of the time you talk to people,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.060]   they say they are high achievers,
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.340]   but they suffer because they go to 7 p.m.,
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.460]   wake up advanced phase sleep syndrome, they call it,
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.380]   they call it a syndrome, but then you have people
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.820]   who would not be able to sleep 'til 5 a.m.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.620]   and not be able to wake up 'til 3 p.m., right?
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.920]   And I'm not so sure that the circadian system
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.140]   is that variable in the human population.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.760]   I mean, clearly there are maybe some genetic factors
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.860]   that make a small percentage of like everything
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.160]   with a bell shape, but I think most of the time,
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.140]   the light environment may play a role.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.500]   And once, as we've talked about,
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.840]   this is a long-term effect of light.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.420]   Once you get into a rhythm, and I don't mean it as a pun,
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.440]   in reality, once you get into a rhythm,
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.820]   it's hard to break out of that rhythm,
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.820]   because if you start sleeping late and waking up late,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.780]   you're not getting the morning sunlight.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.620]   - Right.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.640]   - And so you're just gonna be late.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.940]   And if you're like me, waking up early,
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.300]   you're getting the morning sunlight.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.900]   You're getting what Zeisler said.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.820]   I said his last name wrong.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.020]   The one in Stanford who did the-
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.140]   - Oh, Jamie Zeisler.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.980]   - Zeisler. - Yeah.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.800]   - Yeah.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.400]   - He actually worked for Zeisler, so Zeisler and Zeisler.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.340]   Yeah, there are a lot of Z's, E's, and I's in their names.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.180]   - Yeah.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.020]   - Both phenomenal scientists.
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:32.860]   - Yeah.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.700]   - What it seems to me is the case
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.280]   is that the only way to really know
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.460]   if you're meant to be an early bird, as they call it,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.900]   an early person or a late person, or somewhere in between,
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.220]   is to get morning sunlight
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.260]   and figure out whether or not that makes you feel better.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.000]   - And to understand,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.780]   to be educated about how to measure intensity,
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.180]   how to measure, I put it between quotation,
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.740]   'cause you either get a measuring device,
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.580]   but you cannot depend on your eye to measure intensity.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.500]   - Okay, so how do we do that?
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.140]   'Cause you keep coming back to this,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.020]   so that tells me that's important.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:08.860]   - It's very important.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.500]   - So obviously, so there are apps, like free apps,
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.800]   like LightMeter, where you can walk around
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.340]   and hold the button down and see how many lux,
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.060]   you know, are in the environment.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:18.940]   - These are complicated,
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.240]   because you have to point them to specific regions.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.080]   - So how do people start to develop an intuitive sense
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.260]   of the measurement of intensity?
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.900]   - Yeah, I think at one point I posted on Instagram
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.540]   how I keep my nighttime at home,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.920]   and I found out that my night vision is very strong.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.620]   So I found out that I, especially in the winter,
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.180]   I only need candle lights,
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.620]   so I literally use these tea lights,
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.820]   and I put like 15 or 20 of them.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.700]   - How romantic.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.740]   - And it's so nice, I could see,
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.140]   it clearly doesn't affect my circadian system.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.140]   - You and your cats.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.800]   - And my wife, and it's just great, it's just great, right?
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.980]   But I don't expect people
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.380]   to have the same night vision as me.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.020]   So the simple, I mean, I tell people, do the experiment.
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:07.240]   So if you put three or four lights in your room,
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.600]   switch to, sit for 15 minutes, you have--
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.440]   - Switch two off.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.720]   - Switch two off, let's say you're using five,
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.600]   and see, after 15 minutes,
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.360]   you will not recognize you switched these two off.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.800]   My gut feeling is that most people would need
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.000]   at least 10 times less light than they use at night to see.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.480]   The problem people use it,
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.760]   because most of the time
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.280]   they didn't see the morning sunlight,
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.040]   they are actually hungry for light without their knowledge.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.020]   So they come switch all these lights on,
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.180]   but at the wrong time, because they woke up late.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.820]   - Okay, now I understand.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.280]   So this morning light viewing goes way beyond
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.940]   setting your clock. - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.740]   - It's also a way to determine
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.640]   how little light you need later in the day.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.480]   - Exactly.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.120]   - And we're going to talk about this in a moment,
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.220]   but how little light you get later in the day
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.040]   is a very strong determinant of things
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.080]   like when you will wake up,
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.360]   whether or not you wake up feeling refreshed, et cetera.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.200]   Let's--
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.240]   - And that's why--
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.080]   - Yeah.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.840]   - I'm gonna break it on your show, Andrew,
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.000]   that I'm gonna tell you,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.020]   I think there is something else
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.360]   that people need to think about,
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.540]   which is the tripartite model.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.340]   That this model incorporate three components
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.840]   we should talk about in details
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.760]   that allows us humans and all animals
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.360]   to incorporate the circadian clock
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.040]   and its relation to light, the homeostatic drive,
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.160]   and the direct effect of the environment,
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.160]   which includes stress, light, all kind of stuff.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.320]   They have to be incorporated together.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.540]   If you think, that's what I think right now,
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.920]   if you think of one alone, you will always miss something.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.940]   And when you think of them as a whole,
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.480]   things really become clear.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.000]   It's actually quite amazing.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.520]   - Okay, well, we will definitely want to hear
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.760]   about your tripartite theory
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.640]   and go into detail about this homeostatic mechanisms.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.980]   I wanna make sure that for people who are thinking now,
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.880]   I'm sure, about light and how it impacts them.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.920]   So the morning light viewing behavior,
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.160]   I like to think we've tacked down clearly.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.160]   And thank you for that
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.920]   because there's so much information out there
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.040]   and I've tried to relay that information.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.260]   Of course, you're my primary source
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.700]   for all things circadian, as well as Jamie and others,
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.020]   of course, Matt Walker,
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.960]   but I think you've made that very, very clear.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.440]   Now, let's say I've gotten my morning sunlight, okay?
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.600]   Made my bright artificial light.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.840]   And throughout the day, you said to get a lot of light.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.020]   So I'm working at my desk.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.860]   Maybe I'll go out during the day a few times,
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.500]   but I'm working at my computer, I'm doing things.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.100]   Is there anything about light viewing
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.520]   in the middle of the day that people should keep in mind?
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.640]   Or can they just sort of freestyle it,
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.540]   depending on what they're doing?
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.580]   Most people are not in a dark room throughout the day.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.520]   - My gut feeling, if you got your morning sunlight,
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.700]   you walk from your car slowly or you walk to work,
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.860]   you didn't wear sunglasses
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.380]   when the lights were still dim in the morning,
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.000]   that you could freestyle it.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.700]   That even if you don't get a lot of light,
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.080]   there is a way to just, you know, in the day,
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.340]   you don't have to just worry
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.820]   about getting a lot of bright light.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.820]   But personally, I like to do that.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:09.680]   So I go out at lunch and have my lunch outside as well.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.560]   This reminds the body that here it is even brighter now.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.620]   But the evidence is that you could literally
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.380]   help your circadian clock by giving lights at dawn and dusk.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.860]   But again, if you think of the tripartite model,
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.060]   this may be important versus circadian clock,
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.900]   but is it important for your mood?
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.260]   So that's where I think you need, or the homeostatic drive.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.620]   So that's where you need to think about it.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.780]   So for the clock, for entraining your clock,
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.820]   you literally can entrain it only by the dawn sunlight.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.580]   You actually don't need dawn and dusk.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.820]   You can even forget that.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.840]   - Yeah, and I appreciate that you're distinguishing
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.700]   between circadian effects and other effects of light.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.580]   You're being very precise, which is appreciated.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.660]   Until we hear about this tripartite model,
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.320]   which we will cover, for the sake of the discussion,
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.580]   let's treat the light viewing behavior
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:04.260]   as what are the benefits or drawbacks of viewing light
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.340]   for all biological purposes, not just circadian setting.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.820]   So in the morning, it's clearly going to set the clock.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.820]   And then during the day, if I understand correctly,
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.860]   the idea is to get as much bright light as you can
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.280]   because you're feeding, it sounds like,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.820]   a sort of light hunger.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.140]   - Exactly. - I see.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.220]   - I love this way to put it.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.220]   I think there is a weird light hunger.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:27.660]   Considering that we're not photosynthetic organisms,
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.840]   there is a weird light hunger in animals
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.140]   that they need to measure, they need measure.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.100]   And I think that relates to the season
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.180]   because the whole reproduction cycle of animals
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.660]   is gonna depend on the availability of food
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.600]   in the environment.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.260]   And if you don't know when the season's gonna happen,
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.000]   they don't have calendars,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.700]   it's gonna be very hard to survive.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.060]   So I think that's why we have this light hunger.
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.000]   That's a major hypothesis, it's not been tested.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:54.840]   - Interesting.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.060]   So then afternoon and evening start to approach.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.740]   So I've had this weird experience.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.780]   Maybe you can psychologically
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.220]   or biologically diagnose me now, Samir.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.800]   So where if I go into a movie in the afternoon,
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.500]   like a matinee, and I come out and it's dark,
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.140]   I notice a significant drop in my mood
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.800]   and my ability to go to sleep.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:21.480]   Whereas if I get some view of the light in the evening,
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.900]   doesn't have to be the sunset, although sunsets are nice,
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.780]   but I get some light pulse in the afternoon
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.200]   that I have no trouble whatsoever.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.000]   - And this happens on a single time to watch them?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.840]   - More or less.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.520]   - That's interesting.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.240]   - And then you mentioned the camping experiment
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.400]   where when they went camping,
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.120]   they're seeing the sunrise and the sunset.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   So what should people do in the afternoon/evening time
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.200]   in terms of their light viewing behavior?
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.240]   - I mean, the best thing to do is to let the natural light
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.120]   creep in into darkness, right?
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.680]   That would be the best.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.400]   But clearly that would be inefficient.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.740]   You wanna go home, you wanna read,
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.720]   you wanna talk to your kids,
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.400]   you wanna talk to your family.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.000]   So I think, you know, it's nice to extend the day.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.140]   I don't think that's wrong.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.240]   If you somehow can block that light
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.080]   from affecting your circadian clock.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.400]   - So should people use blue blockers in the evening?
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:19.020]   - I personally do not like any blockers
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.960]   that take a single wavelength of light.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.240]   Because again, if you think of a holistic approach,
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.180]   yes, the blue blocker is gonna prevent you
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.560]   from affecting your circadian clock very much,
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.720]   but then your vision is gonna be distorted
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.220]   because we always see in full spectrum.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.840]   The sun has this beautiful spectrum, right?
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.280]   And then when you start seeing without the blue,
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.740]   things look yellow and it can get really weird, right?
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.800]   I mean, so I personally, I've tried the blue blocker
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.420]   and I couldn't even wear them.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.000]   I thought they were just really horrendous to be honest.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.940]   - Well, along the lines of blue blockers,
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.340]   I think a lot of people mistakenly wear them all day long.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.660]   - Oh my God, that would be very bad.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.260]   - A lot of people do that.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.160]   A lot of people do that.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.060]   They think that the blue light is bad.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.940]   I think that the concept of blue light being bad
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.380]   led to a lot of product development.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.900]   And a lot of people are just assuming
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.580]   that viewing blue light is what was giving them headaches
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.060]   when in fact, it might've just been looking
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.940]   at screens at close distance.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.440]   - So here's the problem, right?
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.060]   I mean, the blue light got the bad reputation
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.100]   because people who gave a pure blue light
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.980]   showed that it caused a huge retinal damage.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.420]   But again, if you're using blue light in its pure form,
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.620]   it has a lot of energy because it's shorter wavelength.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.380]   But we're talking about full spectrum light.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.700]   There are ways now where you could change the spectrum
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.300]   of the light and keep it white between day and night
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.580]   and change the content of the color without you noticing.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.780]   So you don't even have to affect your vision.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.500]   - So how would you go about doing that?
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.780]   - So you just lower the level of the blue light.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.940]   You don't have to eliminate it.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.280]   - So just dim the lights.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.220]   - Dim the blue, but keep, then increase the yellow,
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.860]   but keep all the colors in a certain white.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.840]   So you could have different warmness of white.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.260]   And people know how to do this.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.660]   Physicists know how to do this.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.580]   People who work with light know how to do this.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.260]   - Well, maybe somebody in the wellness slash,
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.100]   I don't like the word,
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.620]   but biohacking or optical community will do this.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.140]   I think it's really important.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.380]   I see so many people wearing blue lockers.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.020]   - I don't know why they love blue.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.180]   - Well, I think they're just uninformed.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.460]   I think, frankly-
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.860]   - And to be honest, it's easy, right?
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.080]   It's easier to explain to somebody,
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.540]   if IPRCCs respond mostly to blue,
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.680]   remove blue, you'll be fine, right?
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.260]   But that's not as simple as that
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.340]   because they also receive road and cone input.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.900]   So you want to actually, and you know,
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.300]   we could go into details that's boring for you listeners,
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.740]   but it also affects the adaptation properties
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.140]   of the whole retina.
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.600]   So you don't want to do something so drastic
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.820]   that you take just one color of the spectrum.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:56.500]   It just seems very counterintuitive to me, to be honest.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.620]   - You've told me before as well,
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:02.380]   that just because these intrinsically photosensitive
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:07.180]   circadian setting ganglion cells respond best to blue light,
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.780]   if the light is bright enough,
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.380]   because they also get input from other components of the eye,
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.940]   it doesn't matter if you block the blues.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.500]   If you're looking at bright light at night,
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.500]   you're going to disrupt your circadian cycle.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.860]   - And that's why I didn't want to go
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.780]   into the boring details, but themselves,
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.320]   the photoreceptors have a wide range of responsiveness.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.360]   So they are most sensitive to blue light,
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.280]   but that doesn't mean they don't respond to green light
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.180]   or to shorter than blue light.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.300]   They respond to very, very wide spectrum
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.000]   with different sensitivities.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.880]   So unless you understand the system,
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.600]   just removing 480, I don't think it's going to do anything.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.480]   - 480 nanometers, yeah.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.480]   So your home is a cave at night, basically.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.760]   - It's a nice cave.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.360]   - It's a nice cave with candles, right?
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.140]   And you and your cats and your lovely wife,
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.260]   who I know who's also a phenomenal scientist
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.100]   in her own right.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:49:59.940]   - Thank you, yeah, she is.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:03.400]   - She is, but you do keep your home
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.120]   quite dim to dark at night.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.120]   In fact, I did go to meetings with some of my friends
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.320]   who work on this, and they really struggled with me.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.600]   They said we could have broken our legs
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.000]   living in the same light environment that you do.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.480]   So I am an extreme, but I measured it for myself,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.960]   and I asked Reggie, my wife, if she's okay with it.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.260]   She also liked the dimness.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.200]   Both of us can see well in dim conditions,
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.320]   and that helps us a lot.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.800]   But I think you have to measure it for yourself.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.520]   You really have to do, it's a very simple experiment.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.040]   Just try to dim the light as much as you can.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.600]   I call it the minimum amount of light
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.280]   you require to see comfortably.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.040]   - And that's how you want your environment,
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.200]   ideally, at night.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.000]   - This is what I think is the game changer.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.440]   If you reach to a level where it's just barely,
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.640]   you're literally on the cusp of seeing uncomfortably
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.840]   versus seeing very comfortably,
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.360]   you are gonna be very much better than,
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.320]   I don't like to make it completely dark.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:08.160]   I think complete darkness induce anxiety in humans,
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.780]   to be honest, so I don't like complete darkness.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.540]   - Kids don't like complete darkness.
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.880]   They like a night light.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.600]   - Even nocturnal animals don't like complete darkness.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.080]   I mean, we have studies in animals that are nocturnal
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.600]   that if you put them in complete darkness
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.480]   for several weeks, they have severe anxiety
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.280]   and depression-like effect.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.100]   So keep the light dim.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.000]   Use red light that is very dim
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.760]   if you wanna keep the room for sleeping.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.260]   Red light that is very dim has very small effect
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:44.960]   on circadian clock, and below 10 lux of red light
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.400]   literally doesn't affect sleep at all.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.320]   So there are ways to do it.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.240]   It's just we need to educate the public,
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:55.580]   and I feel like you literally need a whole lecture
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.720]   to just explain to the people how to deal with light
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.080]   because it's not as simple as people think.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.360]   - Well, that's what we're doing here.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.000]   We're stepping through it piece by piece,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.400]   and the reason we're doing that
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.160]   is because it's not as simple as saying
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.760]   just block blue light or get a lot of light
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.600]   during the day and minimal at night.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.440]   - I mean, just to put it in perspective to tell it,
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.240]   we only have three different cones in our retina
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.040]   that respond to three different colors.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.120]   We call them red cones for simplicity,
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.260]   green cones, and blue cones.
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.100]   Yet we have only three of these,
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:30.640]   but we could see massive palette of colors.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.320]   So that tells you something.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.820]   If the system was just simply about a single color,
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.960]   and it's just removing 480 or just blue is sufficient,
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.480]   then we should only see in red, yellow, and blue.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.160]   We shouldn't see all these different hues of color,
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   but because the system is not that,
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.740]   we see all these different colors.
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.000]   And that's why it's important to remind people
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.560]   that the white light is made of many different colors.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.980]   It's actually like the rainbow.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.040]   That's why you see the rainbow.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.680]   It's made of many colors.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.600]   White light is never truly white.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.800]   It's made of more of different colors.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.400]   - It's like the Pink Floyd album cover.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.000]   - Exactly, exactly, exactly.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.960]   - So dim at night, maybe dim red light ideally,
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.300]   or candlelight, find that minimum required light level.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.320]   - Just make sure when you lower the light,
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.680]   sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes, let your system adapt.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.640]   Because if you had it bright light and you switch it off,
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.800]   surely you're gonna suffer
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.400]   because your system didn't adapt it.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.880]   It was used to very bright light.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.800]   So you want to engage your rods,
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.720]   which take a long time to dark adapt.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.600]   So that's why I tell you, just wait a little bit.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.320]   Don't just switch off the light, don't see, put it on.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.680]   Put it off, sit down, wait for 10 minutes,
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.560]   ideally 15 minutes, and then see how you see.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.880]   And then once you do that, you will notice that actually,
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:55.680]   yeah, I could see quite well, even with much less light.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.400]   - What do you do regarding screens?
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.480]   - Yeah, that's the hardest thing.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.300]   Again, I mean, there are beautiful programs
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.680]   that change the whole intensity and color of the screen.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.040]   These could help dim your screen at night
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.960]   to the lowest part.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.440]   I mean, yes, you won't see it
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.540]   when you wake up in the morning,
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.800]   but then you can increase the intensity.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.200]   So try to decrease.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.700]   I mean, just what we were talking about.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:25.140]   Think of light intensity, duration, color, and time of day.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.740]   You really have to keep these four things together, right?
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:31.200]   - We've roomed together at a couple of meetings
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.840]   from time to time, no longer, because one of us,
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.740]   not to be named, has a severe snoring issue
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.360]   that made the other one pseudo-homicidal.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.780]   You can guess who that was.
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:49.300]   But I've seen you check your phone after dark once or twice,
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:53.140]   and you did it by sort of pointing your phone
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.060]   away from you, right?
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:57.960]   - And actually, I'm sort of half joking,
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.440]   and you dim it quite a bit.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.840]   I'm sort of half joking, but it actually makes sense
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.760]   that if you shine a flashlight in your eye,
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.000]   it's much brighter than if you shine a flashlight on the--
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.440]   - Light only go in direct line.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.120]   So if you just look on the side,
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.840]   most of the light is going to go this way,
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.600]   and you're only seeing this way.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.520]   - Okay, and as silly as that might seem to people listening,
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.040]   I mean, what it means is that getting bright light
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.360]   in your eyes at night is something
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.000]   that you really want to avoid, but there is the reality.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.600]   - And even when I check sometimes,
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.180]   if I have something and I check it so fast
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:29.260]   and switch it off so fast,
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.060]   so I'm also aware of the duration.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.420]   - Not my messages.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.720]   - I'm also aware of the duration, right?
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.220]   So duration, intensity, color, and time of day.
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.160]   Ideally, I should not check iPhones and iPads.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.360]   I don't use iPad at night because it's hard
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.440]   to lower it enough 'cause it's huge.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.480]   But even my iPhone, I try not to use it at night.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.720]   And once it becomes 8.30 or nine, I don't look at it at all.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.560]   - Unless it's World Cup or Euro Cup,
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.920]   in which case Sanders on 24 hours, everybody.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.720]   - That's only every four years.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.760]   [laughing]
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.180]   - He's a big soccer fan.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:06.340]   All right, this has been incredibly, no pun, illuminating.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.420]   Let's talk about the relationship between light
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:13.560]   and some of these other non-circadian
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.880]   or pseudo-circadian effects.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.140]   And we will try and link those.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.640]   But you had a, what I consider,
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.240]   absolutely landmark, beautiful paper,
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.900]   published in "Nature" a few years ago,
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:31.900]   showing that if you disrupt the exposure to light
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.960]   or the timing of the exposure to light,
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.120]   that there are dramatic effects on the stress system
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.000]   and on the learning and memory system.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.040]   Maybe we could talk about each of those
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.400]   separately or together.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.040]   What are the effects on stress and the effects on learning
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:52.440]   when light-viewing behavior and sleep-wake cycles
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.280]   are disrupted?
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.560]   - Yeah, so just to remind you, you know that,
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.480]   but to remind your listeners that I was trained
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:05.200]   as a circadian biologist, so I really was indoctrinated
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.660]   into thinking that light has to affect the clock,
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.160]   which then cause all these different effects.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.760]   So that's what I believe, that's my dogma,
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.700]   that's what would have made me really happy.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:18.900]   And then Tara LeGates and Kara Altimas joined the lab
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.620]   and said, and we started discussing a lot of data,
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.200]   and we said, what if there is a direct effect of light
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.260]   that we're missing independent of the circadian clock?
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:29.980]   So this is not an easy question to ask, to answer,
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.080]   because as we've been talking all along,
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.660]   light affects the circadian clock.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:37.460]   So how could you give light at different times of the day
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.340]   and not mess up the circadian clock?
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.060]   Luckily, we came up with such a way,
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:44.940]   and that's why it was important to do this experiment
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.460]   the way we did them.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.900]   And we proved that this light-dark cycle
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.340]   does not disrupt the clock,
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.460]   there is still a circadian rhythm,
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.900]   and does not cause sleep deprivation.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.900]   And yet, surprisingly, if you give light
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.140]   at the wrong time of the day,
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.760]   even without disrupting the circadian clock,
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:06.140]   or without causing sleep deprivation, as you mentioned,
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:10.800]   you get huge mood changes in the organisms,
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.740]   and you get learning deficit.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.540]   So this really, and at the time,
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:17.860]   people have really hit us hard.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:21.140]   I mean, it was really hard to publish this work,
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.740]   and you could, yeah.
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:26.860]   - Well, it came out in nature, so in the end, you prevailed.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.340]   But I want to make sure that I understand.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:32.080]   So you're saying that, yes, there are effects of light
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.100]   on the circadian rhythm, meaning sleep and wakefulness,
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:37.420]   and their timing.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.840]   However, there are direct effects of light on mood
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.540]   that can be dissociated from the effects
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.860]   on sleep and waking.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.160]   So if I interpret that correctly,
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.960]   that could mean that when we view light
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.000]   and how much light could make us feel happier,
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.820]   or less happy, or even depressed,
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:58.560]   stressed, learning, et cetera.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.480]   - Bingo.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.000]   - Even if we're sleeping and waking up
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:03.880]   at the appropriate time.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:04.720]   - Bingo.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.160]   I mean, eventually, because we're talking about
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.620]   the whole system, eventually when you start having
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:12.900]   the other problems, you also develop sleep problems.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:14.180]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.700]   And in fact, now, research from Diego Fernandez
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.620]   in the lab have found that now we know
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:23.120]   that they actually require different brain regions.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.180]   So we don't only have a theory,
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.940]   we don't only have a light environment
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.240]   that showed they can be dissociated.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.300]   We know that they use completely different brain regions.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.580]   So the SCN that I told you about earlier,
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.700]   the place where the central pacemaker is,
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.420]   the one that receives direct input from the retina
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:43.100]   through the iPRGCs to adjust your circadian clock,
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.020]   is not the area that receives the light input
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.080]   for mood regulation.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.020]   It's a completely different brain region.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:50.180]   - What's the brain region called?
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:51.720]   - So the brain region, we called it
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.060]   the perihabineular nucleus.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.880]   I'm not so sure how good or bad the name,
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.020]   but doesn't matter, it's the PHB.
[00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.580]   And what's really amazing, this region also receives
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.740]   direct input from the iPRGCs,
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.520]   but projects to areas in the brain
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.980]   that are known to regulate mood, including
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.580]   the ventral medial prefrontal cortex,
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.200]   which has been studied for many years
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.000]   to be impacted in a human depression.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.860]   So just by this amazing serendipity
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:24.860]   to find that a region that is so deep in the advanced brain,
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:29.060]   like the prefrontal cortex is your executive brain,
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.040]   one of the most elaborated in humans,
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.500]   to see that they receive input from these
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.220]   ancient photoreceptor was stunning to us
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.380]   and told us how much we didn't understand
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.100]   the importance of light on a human behavior.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.620]   - So how does that finding inform daily protocols
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.940]   for you or for other people?
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:52.460]   I realize you can't leap to always from one paper
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.660]   to daily protocols.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:57.100]   But if light indeed does control prefrontal cortex,
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:01.240]   executive function, learning, stress, and mood,
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:05.180]   and let's say I'm waking up each morning and I'm sleeping,
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:06.680]   what should I do differently?
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.940]   - That's why we came up with the tripartite model.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.160]   Because yes, we could think about just adjusting the clock
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.880]   with lights in and being dark throughout the day.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.400]   But that may not be important
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.920]   for your whole physiological function.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.680]   So now if we include these other effects of light,
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.740]   that's why I prefer to still get a lot of light in the day.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.920]   I don't wanna be in very dim light condition
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.760]   throughout the day.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.580]   - I see.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.680]   - So even though it doesn't affect your clock,
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.140]   as you beautifully said, Andrew,
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.780]   it may affect your mood and learning and memory.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.600]   It may affect your alertness level,
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.540]   which is gonna allow you to learn better.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:41.140]   It may affect your homeostatic drive.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:43.500]   Maybe your homeostatic factor will go higher
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.260]   so you could sleep earlier.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.580]   So it's important to think of light
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.840]   as stimulating all these brain regions,
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.340]   which means it's producing more activity,
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.260]   which in reality,
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.620]   this is how people think of the homeostatic drive,
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.180]   that the more active you are,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.740]   the more the homeostatic drive is built up,
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.520]   the better you sleep.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.580]   So that's why we came up with the tripartite model,
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.560]   because as a circadian biologist,
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.780]   I only thought of light through the circadian clock
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.240]   affecting behavior.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.300]   As a sleep biologist,
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.460]   they only thought of the homeostatic drive
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.780]   affecting sleep, affecting behavior.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.620]   And for people who study light for vision and other things,
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:21.000]   they thought only of the environmental input.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.860]   But now if you put them all together,
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.700]   you get with this tripartite model
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:28.320]   where it's really mind-boggling and it makes so much sense.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.620]   The organism doesn't wanna depend on a single component,
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.700]   but if you could incorporate these three together,
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:38.080]   you could have a beautiful system that is well-adapted.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.340]   So let me tell you the sleep-wake cycle, right?
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:43.580]   So we know there is a homeostatic drive to affect sleep.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.840]   We've had beautiful talks about that.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.460]   - Which is basically the longer you're awake,
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.420]   the more you wanna be asleep.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.300]   - So that's your homeostatic drive.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.900]   We've talked about the circadian influence of sleep
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.680]   and the fact that light-dark cycle
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.260]   affect the circadian system,
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.060]   which eventually affects sleep.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.260]   So these two components are well understood.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:03.180]   Now the third factor is your direct light
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.780]   or environmental input.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.280]   How much stress, how much light you get from there
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.640]   also can highly impact sleep.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.320]   So even if you have a good circadian and homeostatic drive,
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.800]   if you're getting light at the wrong time of the day
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.080]   or if you're being stressed and thinking,
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.820]   then your sleep's gonna suffer.
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.660]   So you have to think of the three together
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.840]   to have a beautiful sleep-wake cycle.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.120]   And that's why we came up with the tripartite motor.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.720]   The same thing happens with feeding.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.760]   I could beautifully put it to people.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.680]   Your hunger, your energy level
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.140]   is measured by the arcuate nucleus.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.300]   Your daily intake of food is, again,
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.120]   dependent on the SCN and light-dark input.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.960]   We found that if food is not available,
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.520]   there is yet a third input that is not dependent on the SCN,
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.800]   not dependent on the arcuate,
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.840]   depending on a completely different brain regions
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.020]   so the animal can actually start looking,
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.560]   or the human can start looking for food when it's scarce,
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.560]   even at time when they are not supposed to be active.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.200]   So that's how the organism think.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.400]   They have to evaluate multiple inputs for them to decide
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.360]   what is the best physiological outcome at that moment,
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.340]   at that season.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.980]   - I see.
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.720]   So I wanna get into arcuate and feeding,
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.400]   but just to make sure we can keep our hands
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.540]   around this tripartite model.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.680]   So if I understand correctly,
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.040]   we've got the circadian influence,
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.480]   then you've also got the drive to sleep.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.080]   Actually, one of the ways
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.520]   that I think that can be best understood is
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.060]   if somebody ever pulls an all-nighter,
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.340]   they get tired around 11 or 12 or so,
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.480]   and then very tired around 3, 4 a.m.,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.320]   but then even if you stay up,
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.960]   sometime right around 7 or 8 a.m.,
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.140]   your normal wake-up time, you start to feel alert again.
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.480]   - Exactly. - And that's because
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.960]   the sleep drive is extremely strong,
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.240]   but there's a circadian rhythm
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.040]   that drives wakefulness in the morning.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.720]   - Okay, so that's two of the components.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.320]   Before we get into the feeding component,
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.000]   I wanna talk about these direct effects of light on mood.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.880]   Okay, Diego Fernandez's data.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.560]   And this perihabenular thing.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.240]   So let's just, for the moment,
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.720]   set aside the tri part of the tripartite model
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.880]   and just focus on what are the direct effects
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.040]   of light on mood?
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.480]   And the way that I interpret what you've said so far is
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.600]   that the protocol that emerges from this,
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.120]   if one is trying to optimize their mood,
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.960]   is, yes, see light, view light, I should say,
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.560]   early in the day in order to set your circadian clock,
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.520]   maybe also in the evening as well.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.660]   And of course, avoid light at night,
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.480]   get it as dim as possible.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.360]   However, you said it's also a good idea
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.880]   to get as much bright light during the day as you safely can
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.560]   in order to improve your mood
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.120]   independently of regulating your sleep-wake cycle.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.360]   - And that's a hypothesis.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.960]   Here's the problem where it's not gonna be as satisfying
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.160]   as the circadian is that, as you know,
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.040]   this brain region has been discovered very recently.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.880]   - Habenula.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.000]   - The perihabenular region.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.280]   - We've known about it a long time,
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.260]   but nobody knew what it did.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.760]   - So we knew about the habenula,
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.720]   but that's why the name is confusing.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.680]   It's actually not the habenula itself.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.720]   It's the perihabenula.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.540]   - No, near the habenula.
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.380]   - It's near the habenula.
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.160]   - Why don't you just call it the Semer-Hattar nucleus?
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.520]   - I should have, I don't know why I've done that.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.480]   - Maybe 'cause if you do that, it's not okay.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.460]   Okay, so for herever after, the perihabenular nucleus,
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.080]   we should probably call it the Hattar-
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.360]   - The Hattar-Fernandez.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.480]   - How about Hattar-Fernandez-Berson?
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.080]   Okay, this is like nerdy science attribution stuff,
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.700]   but I'm just gonna call it the Hattar nucleus.
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.060]   Wikipedia, line it up.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.320]   Okay, so this structure is taking light,
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.320]   and independent of sleep rhythms and circadian rhythms,
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.140]   it's driving changes in mood.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.040]   How does it do that?
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.460]   Is this through the dopamine system,
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.640]   the serotonin system?
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.940]   - We still recently,
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.120]   we haven't identified this region very well.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.160]   We don't know what light does to it.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.680]   We don't know how it interacts.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.640]   So this is an area that is ripe for discoveries,
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.640]   and we're working on this right now.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.760]   But that's why I said it's not satisfying.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.020]   This is like the function of sleep.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.200]   Why do we sleep?
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.040]   We know sleep is very important to us,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.160]   but we still don't have a satisfying function
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.880]   of why do we sleep, right?
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.480]   - I see, but the why questions,
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.640]   I think it's our good friend and colleague
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.320]   at University of Washington, Russ Van Gelder,
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.360]   who always says, when somebody asks why,
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.120]   the best answer is just to say,
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.800]   I wasn't consulted at the design phase, right?
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.080]   None of us really know why.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.700]   - No, but the point is, maybe I shouldn't have said why.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.200]   What is the function of sleep?
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.340]   It's still very hard to know.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:24.700]   Why would, what is the reason organisms
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.240]   have to go offline for so long?
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.880]   You know, people assume it's for repair,
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.440]   assume it's for learning and memory,
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.720]   assume all kind of stuff,
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.240]   but there is really no clear function for sleeping.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.480]   There is no clear function for sleeping.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.360]   I mean, if you talk to people, there are hypotheses.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.320]   I mean, all we know is that if you don't sleep,
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.840]   or your sleep is very fractured, you get messed up.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.440]   - And you could die even, right?
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.700]   I mean, it's really bad if you don't sleep,
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.800]   but we don't know what is the function.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.260]   What is that sleep have gone to organisms
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.760]   that couldn't have done with rest?
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.000]   What if you just could rest without sleeping,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.120]   just sit down and rest?
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.800]   - Well, my lab is trying to figure out
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.000]   whether or not these non-sleep deep rest protocols
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.200]   can compensate for sleep.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.080]   I mean, obviously sleep is better,
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.620]   but many people are not getting the sleep that they need.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.320]   But, okay, so, and if people are sensing
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.480]   that Samir and I are about to start talking over each other
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.480]   and arguing, that's always the goal when we talk, right?
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.500]   Unlike other scientists I interact with,
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.680]   when Samir and I get together,
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.880]   it's considered a successful conversation
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.700]   if we get into a big fight and then go for a big meal
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.240]   where I pick the restaurant.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:38.100]   Okay, so let's talk about food and eating and appetite.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.560]   You had yet another, yes,
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.820]   I greatly admire your success in this way,
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:48.160]   yet another incredible discovery
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.360]   showing that there are direct, excuse me,
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:55.240]   effects of light on appetite and feeding behavior.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.440]   Maybe you could just summarize those results for people.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.600]   - Honestly, that paper is the one that allowed us
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.120]   to come with the tripartite model
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.880]   because we were thinking completely wrong about it.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.920]   We wanted, this experiment,
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.960]   it'd be fun for your audience to hear
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.920]   why we started this experiment.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.080]   Remember that when we discovered the IPRGCs,
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:17.240]   we figured if they are the only relay
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.280]   to entrain the circadian clock,
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.320]   then you could kill them and have an animal
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.960]   opposite to the one that we spoke,
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.440]   or a human opposite to the one that we spoke about earlier,
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:29.420]   where instead of having no pattern vision
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.560]   and have circadian photo entrainment,
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.000]   we could produce an animal that have pattern vision
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.120]   but no circadian photo entrainment.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.600]   - So circadian blind.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.760]   - Circadian blind, but pattern sighted,
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.840]   and we succeeded in that.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.500]   The problem when you have these animals,
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.820]   which I've told you many times already,
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.680]   is that they don't adjust to the day/night cycle.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.440]   So doing experiments on them become very complicated.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.800]   - What is their behavior like if you don't have these cells?
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.200]   Are they awake and then asleep, awake and then asleep?
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.800]   - They just drift like the humans we've talked about.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.220]   - They think they're in Las Vegas.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.960]   - They drift, exactly.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.400]   - They stay up later every night.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.360]   - They come either, depend, they're a clock.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.600]   If their clock is shorter, they come in earlier.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.160]   If their clock is longer, they come in later.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160]   - So they're really messed up.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.960]   - They really don't adjust to the,
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.120]   if they were in the wild,
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.000]   they'll be eliminated in a second, right?
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   There is no way they'll survive.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.900]   So me and Diego started talking and we're like,
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.640]   what if we use non-light entraining agent,
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.880]   and what is the strong non-light entraining agent?
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.000]   Food.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.640]   So we thought that the light defective animals
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.880]   will have more sensitivity to food entrainment,
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.440]   because as you know more than me,
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.880]   this is an area that you've worked really well on.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.040]   For vision, if you're image blind,
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.880]   you're hearing and somatosensory get improved, right?
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.640]   The lack of vision improves your hearing and sensation.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.120]   But we found actually that if you don't have
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.120]   the light system, actually you're feeding,
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.900]   the food ability to entrain the animal
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.840]   goes completely to the ground,
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.760]   completely opposite to what we predicted.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.400]   So light viewing and feeding behavior
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.840]   are interacting in ways that support one another.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.000]   - And that's why we came with the tripartite model.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.280]   We figured it's different than sensation of the environment.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.640]   When you sense with vision, vision and hearing interact,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.180]   but your vision is a real full modality.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:23.180]   You want to see, that's what vision want to do.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.600]   You want to hear, that's what hearing want to do.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.260]   You want to sense, that's what sensing want to do.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:32.340]   But for the circadian system, light, food,
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.780]   all these in training Asian,
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:38.240]   they somehow have to interact to keep a coherent system.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.140]   You don't just assume if you remove light,
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.380]   this one is going to be stronger.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.680]   No, they need to know each other's.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.360]   The light informs when the animal's going to eat.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.160]   - Well, what I like about this so much is that,
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:52.560]   you know, in the other, in the world outside of science
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.200]   in which I don't really exist in,
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.700]   but that I see a lot of this kind of wellness,
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.600]   you know, stuff with this,
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.840]   all this mind body integration stuff,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.060]   it's interesting because people view the body
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.560]   more as a system, right?
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.400]   A system of organs that interact,
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.540]   as opposed to the way that standard science
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.140]   and medical profession is like,
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.740]   you work on the liver or your ear, nose and throat,
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:18.340]   or heart and lung or brain or, you know.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.060]   - That's a great way of thinking.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.060]   - But the biology is integrated.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:22.900]   - Yeah.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.680]   - I mean, and so for somebody who's interested
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.320]   in affecting their eating behavior,
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.620]   something that you are familiar with
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.820]   and that we will talk more about your experiences
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.660]   of in a moment,
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:37.940]   how should they use light
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.660]   in order to adjust their eating behavior?
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.500]   - Right.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.160]   So now that I've told you about all these interaction
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.780]   between the different inputs to the circadian clock,
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.740]   just you think about it as an engineer,
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.300]   what would be the best thing?
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.260]   The best thing is to know
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.080]   when your food times happen in the day,
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.340]   when should you get light
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.620]   and where is your circadian,
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.060]   when is your circadian clock in your system, right?
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.500]   So if you eat at very specific times of the day,
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.140]   that's another signal that is telling your body,
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.620]   your clock, you're in a certain time of the day.
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.320]   So if you're having lunch at the correct time every day
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.620]   and you're getting bright light,
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:18.060]   now you have two systems that are informing your clock,
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.540]   your clock is gonna be better.
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.020]   - So regular meal times.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:24.180]   - Regular meal times that fit your circadian clock.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.380]   So, and in fact, if you do that,
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.380]   when I started doing this
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.100]   and it helped me lose weight,
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.700]   is that I'm exposing myself
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.020]   to the right amount of light dark cycle.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.940]   I'm eating at regular time.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.020]   It is amazing.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.540]   You will be not hungry, let's say,
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:39.620]   let's say you eat at noon.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:42.500]   You will not feel any hunger at 11.45
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.220]   and then all of a sudden the hunger jumps.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.100]   This is clearly not an energy issue
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.380]   because it could not be that drastic.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:52.280]   - Right, no, the desire to eat is mainly driven by these,
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.940]   these cues, these hormone cues
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:14:00.820]   that are very exquisitely timed to sleep-wake cycle,
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.260]   but also to light.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.500]   - Exactly, and you know, in the wild,
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.380]   you could imagine why energy level
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.380]   through the arcuate nucleus.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.080]   - You should explain to people what the arcuate is
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.900]   'cause I don't think we've done that adequately.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.260]   The arcuate nucleus is an area of the hypothalamus
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.660]   that drives hunger and feeding behavior.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.020]   And what we're talking about is the fact that
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:23.080]   it's taking cues from your viewing of light,
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.240]   believe it or not, is impacting your level of hunger.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.880]   And this is a non-trivial way
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.800]   in which your timing of hunger and amount of hunger
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.740]   is regulated by when and how much light you view.
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.720]   So let me ask you a couple of practical--
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.200]   - But can I just, this is really, before you ask me,
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.460]   sorry, Andrew, we said we were gonna fight,
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:46.920]   but to me, it's the interesting thing to think about it.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.260]   In the wild, when you didn't have
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.640]   the availability of food that we have,
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.180]   the arcuate plays a huge important role
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:57.360]   because if you weren't successful in getting food,
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.580]   then the arc is gonna tell you,
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:01.120]   look, you have to take risk and go get food
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.200]   because your energy level is very low.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.400]   And that's great, that's tons of great research about that.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.620]   But I think what's missing is the fact in humans,
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.760]   we're not getting to a situation, most of us,
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.040]   we're not getting to a situation
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.360]   where we have low energy levels.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.300]   Most of the time, actually, we eat not because we want to,
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.400]   because we really have low energy,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.980]   but because we want to eat.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:26.320]   So I think that's why I feel that the timing
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.980]   is very important for us
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:31.480]   because we always have enough energy level for us to eat.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.840]   - Well, I mean, I enjoy eating so much that I'll eat
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.800]   just for the sensation of chewing.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.200]   I mean, I enjoy the taste too,
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.920]   and I enjoy the social aspects when those are a part of it,
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.740]   but I literally enjoy the physical act of chewing,
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:47.500]   which explains a lot.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:52.500]   Okay, so how regular are you,
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:56.240]   or do you recommend people be about meal times?
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.020]   Because what I'm hearing is that light viewing behavior
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:01.960]   is pretty straightforward.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.880]   Get a lot of light in the morning and throughout the day,
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.720]   minimize it in the evening and at night,
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.120]   generally speaking, for sake of mood and circadian rhythm.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:13.560]   But for sake of regulating timing and quality,
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.760]   I should also say, of food intake,
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.380]   because people clearly make better choices about food intake
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.700]   when they are anticipating a meal
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.700]   and they aren't constantly hungry.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:26.100]   And so the ability to regulate hunger for particular phases
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.120]   of the circadian cycle is quite valuable for all people,
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.300]   not just people trying to lose weight, but all people.
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.980]   Are we talking about down to the minute?
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.500]   Like if I- - Absolutely not.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:40.020]   - All right, so 12 noon is my normal lunch, let's say,
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.400]   plus or minus?
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.260]   - Half an hour.
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:45.740]   - Okay, so eat around between 11.30 and 12.30.
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:48.000]   If that's the time, and it depends,
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.640]   if you also do multiple meals.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.020]   Remember, three meals, that's decision
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.480]   that somebody came up with.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.320]   I don't know why.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.520]   - Nowadays, fewer people are doing that, I think.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.360]   - Yeah.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.040]   - Given our friend Sachin Panda's work.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.260]   - Right, I mean, so you could have two meals.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:04.800]   You could have very multiple meals
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.960]   that are distributed across your active time.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.540]   I agree with Sachin Panda's work that try to avoid eating
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.900]   when your system is supposed to be relaxing,
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.540]   when you're supposed to be at non-active time.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.980]   So, you know, limit your eating
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:23.580]   to the active time of your cycle.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.960]   And that seemed to be,
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.180]   and Joe Takahashi is doing some beautiful stuff on this.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:30.100]   That seems to be incredibly important
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:33.300]   for aspect of the circadian.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.140]   - And for health.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:34.960]   - And for health.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:35.800]   - Yeah, I mean, Sachin,
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.520]   we're referring to Sachin Panda's work.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.820]   He wrote a beautiful book called "The Circadian Code."
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:43.420]   Maybe, Samir, with some luck, you'll write a book as well.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.060]   Meaning the world would be lucky to have that book.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.580]   But Sachin's data really strongly points to the fact
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.980]   that liver health, brain health,
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:56.180]   metabolic factors, and endocrine factors
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:59.620]   of various systems and organs all seem to benefit
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.240]   from having a period of each 24-hour day
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.620]   in which we are not eating anything
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.660]   and then eating it very regular sometimes.
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.580]   Let's talk about eating and mealtimes,
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.300]   and let's move a little bit away
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.140]   from the science for the moment,
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.460]   although we will return to it,
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:16.660]   and talk a little bit more about your experience
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.460]   with eating and mealtimes.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.420]   So you're looking in good shape lately.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.260]   - Thank you.
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.760]   - I know you've been putting work into it.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.900]   We talk a lot, and you've been exercising,
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:30.500]   and you've been eating well, meaning quality food.
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:31.540]   You just came back from Jordan,
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.660]   where I'm assuming the food is amazing.
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.420]   - The food is amazing, and honestly,
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.740]   usually I gained a lot of weight in Jordan,
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.980]   but this time I didn't gain any weight,
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:41.820]   which was really nice, so.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:45.140]   - Yeah, when I met you,
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:49.060]   you were probably about 100 pounds heavier
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:49.900]   than you are now.
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:53.820]   - Yeah, 275 pounds, I'm 219 now, it's crazy, yeah.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:54.920]   - You had a lot of vigor then,
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.700]   and you have a lot of vigor now,
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:01.500]   but I know that you undertook a very specific protocol
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.720]   in order to lose the weight.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.280]   Based on your understanding of the circadian system
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.140]   and of light and appetite and mood,
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.520]   maybe you could just tell us a little bit
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.280]   about what that schedule looks like,
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.960]   and we realize that this is not a prescriptive for everybody,
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.440]   but you found what worked for you.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.760]   Maybe just describe those changes.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.560]   - I mean, honestly, I followed my circadian cycle, right,
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.960]   of what we've talked about, right?
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:27.940]   So I dimmed the light at night, I slept at regular hours,
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.020]   I ate my major food in breakfast and lunch
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.640]   when I'm really active and I'm really hungry,
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.720]   and at night, when I avoid dinner
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.340]   because my circadian system really shuts off at three,
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.260]   I'm an early person, like you could give me anything
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.380]   I would eat before three.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.740]   After three, nothing appeals to me anymore.
[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:46.100]   My system is shut off.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.240]   - What time are you going to sleep
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.080]   and what time are you waking up?
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.460]   - Oh, so in my case, I should have put this on.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.340]   I mean, I go to sleep literally at 9 p.m.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.580]   I mean, I literally, five minutes after 9 p.m.,
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.380]   I'm completely out,
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:01.000]   and I wake up between 4.30 and 5 a.m.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.580]   So if I extend it, I go to 6 a.m.,
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:06.600]   but very rarely, depends on how tired I was.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.600]   - And that, as I recall, was an important set of changes
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.840]   for you to be able to regulate your food intake.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.760]   - Absolutely, because then I'm having very big breakfast at,
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.420]   and again, for different people, it's different.
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.840]   I have a big breakfast at 7 a.m. maximum.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.840]   So I have a big breakfast, coffee, and all this stuff.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.020]   Then I have some simple snack around 10.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.800]   Then I have regularly lunch at noon or between noon to one.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.360]   Then I have another snack at three,
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.200]   and the hardest time to regulate the food
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.440]   is between 12 and three.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.520]   This is when I really feel hungry all the time.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.520]   - This is your equivalent of kind of late evening
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.360]   for most people. - Yes.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.640]   - So for me, it would probably be between seven and 10 p.m.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.360]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.000]   And then at night, I'm completely not hungry,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.640]   but usually, as you said, the enjoyment of food,
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.080]   like when my wife cooks some really beautiful Indian food,
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.160]   I eat, but I'm not hungry.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.120]   And I notice if I eat with that, I usually gain weight.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.400]   But if I regulate that at night, I also lose weight.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.040]   So there is a combination of all these things
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:11.280]   that help you adjust the input of food,
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.680]   the input of light, the input of the clock,
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.920]   and the drive to hunger.
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.480]   - Yeah, I appreciate you sharing that.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.480]   And I want to emphasize that some people
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:21.200]   are not hungry early in the day.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.680]   They might be late-shifted people,
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:25.080]   in which case eating later in the day will work well.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.640]   - It will work as long as they don't eat
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:27.480]   early in the morning.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.880]   That's just, you have to work with your schedule,
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.440]   with your active schedule.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.320]   - Yeah, you and I have been talking about this offline
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.160]   for years.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.680]   We're finally having this discussion publicly now.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.240]   What we're talking about really is finding
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.800]   your ideal sleep schedule.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.640]   - Exactly.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.120]   - And finding your ideal eating schedule.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:43.960]   - Exactly.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.400]   - And understanding how those two things interact.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.040]   - And you know, the nice thing, as you said,
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.240]   finding them out is going to help you to understand
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.480]   how they interact because we know from the tripartite model
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.840]   that they are all interconnected.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.040]   And for each person,
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.600]   they're going to be interconnected differently.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.680]   So for each person, you would, you know, for me,
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:07.000]   if I exercise at night, I'm going to mess up my whole system.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.240]   - So when do you exercise?
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.080]   - Morning.
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.440]   Morning works great for me.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.800]   I mean, it's amazing.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.800]   Morning exercise for me works great.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.240]   I tried one time because it was easier for me
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.240]   to exercise at night before I leave
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.360]   when the traffic is there from the night.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.640]   And I think that messed me up because I couldn't sleep well
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.040]   and I couldn't wake up well.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.840]   And that led to more changes in my food.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.840]   I gained weight again, actually, believe it or not,
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.600]   even though I was exercising.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.360]   So I think this really makes me think
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.160]   that you have to think of the tripartite model
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.320]   to see where is the best times
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.200]   and what is the best interrelation
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.880]   between the different components, as you beautifully said,
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.320]   between your meal times, your light exposure,
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.800]   and your sleep that works for you.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.640]   - Well, thank you for that.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.360]   Usually Samir's insulting me today.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.560]   He's complimenting me.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.120]   I'm going to compliment him right back by saying,
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.480]   this is the first time that I've ever really understood
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:04.480]   how yes, light can control sleep.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.200]   Yes, it can control mood.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.040]   Yes, it can impact feeding,
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.720]   but that it's really about doing the self exploration
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.560]   to align those in the way that works best.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.520]   And what I'm hearing, tell me if I'm wrong,
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:19.320]   but what I'm hearing is that once you understand
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.960]   what gives you the best sleep-wake cycle,
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.480]   then you should exercise during the period of time
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.640]   in which you feel most alert.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.680]   And if it works for your schedule,
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.920]   ideally you would also eat during the time
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.800]   in which you feel most alert and then stop eating
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.280]   and stop light viewing behavior as you head towards sleep.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.120]   - Right.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.240]   So the only thing I would say that complicates all of this,
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.080]   and that's what makes me sad, is your light exposure.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:45.920]   - Mine personally?
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.640]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:49.880]   - The people's light exposure, right?
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.400]   This is what complicates it
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.000]   because you're not going to be able to figure all this out
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.720]   if you're shifting yourself out of your comfort zone.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.540]   - By viewing?
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:01.260]   - By viewing light at the wrong time of the day.
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:06.260]   So let's say if you were under an idle natural conditions,
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:09.260]   you're a person who would sleep later than me,
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.980]   let's say will sleep at midnight and wake up at 8 a.m.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.020]   Let's say you don't eat anything till noon
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.860]   and as you said, you eat late in the evening,
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.620]   then this would be perfect for you.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.420]   But now see what happens
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:23.340]   if now you include the light component.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:26.820]   Now if you push your sleep from midnight to 4 a.m.,
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.300]   now you're waking up in the morning
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:31.980]   and you're actually really not the morning,
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:35.040]   you're working up, sorry, at noon instead of 8 o'clock
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.460]   and the time where you're not supposed to be hungry,
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.740]   now you're gonna start eating directly at noon
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:42.260]   or something like that or even delay it.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:43.980]   And now you're shifting your whole cycle
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.680]   and you don't know if this interaction
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.440]   between your sleep feeding and the light dark environment
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.580]   are still gonna be maintained or not.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.500]   And that's the problem that people have.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:56.700]   - So as I'm hearing this, what I'm realizing is most of us,
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:00.420]   probably me included, are messing up at least one,
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:02.460]   two or three of these components.
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:06.500]   But that the probe, the way to figure out
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.020]   what's right for oneself
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.660]   is to start manipulating light exposure.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.880]   - And I'm gonna be honest, I'm biased
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:18.020]   'cause I believe that light is the strongest time giver.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.620]   And a lot of people disagree.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.100]   Some people think feeding is.
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.420]   - I always thought that light was the primary zeit-giver,
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:24.260]   the primary--
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:25.860]   - Yeah, but a lot of people think it's food.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:28.620]   A lot of people even sometimes mention social interactions.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:29.980]   - And they read the literature?
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:31.060]   - I agree with you.
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.440]   I totally agree with you.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.940]   - I mean, my understanding is that light
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.020]   is the most powerful driver of the things we're talking about.
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:38.660]   - That's why I think we need to regulate this first
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.420]   and everything else fits.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.360]   And you know, the nice thing is that your sleep-wake cycle
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.820]   and exercise tell you really bluntly
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.220]   if you're doing it right or not.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:48.120]   - Tell me more about that.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:48.960]   - I'll tell you more.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.140]   When I shifted my exercise, honestly,
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:54.280]   things fell apart like never before.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.060]   - When you moved from exercising
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:56.900]   early in the day to late in the day.
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:57.740]   - In the morning, yeah.
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:59.480]   It completely fell apart for me.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.480]   I didn't enjoy exercise at night.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.260]   My pain tolerance for exercise wasn't as good.
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:06.500]   I'm talking with N equals one and I'm aware of this.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.700]   I've never tested this empirically.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:12.340]   But at least to me, it really messed up everything.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:13.500]   I started having problems
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.540]   'cause my body temperature will go up
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:16.980]   and that will affect my sleep.
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:19.460]   I possibly was running in the gym with a lot of lights,
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.420]   so maybe the light was a component.
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.680]   But for me, exercising in the morning,
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.520]   it's so much better for me.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.200]   But a lot of people can't even think
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:29.760]   of exercising in the morning.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.960]   So it depends on when you feel comfortable
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.160]   in your sleep-wake cycle and your exercise.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.880]   I think that tells you if your system
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.480]   is in synchrony with one another.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   - That's really interesting.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.120]   You know, we're good friends.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.660]   Our friend Pat Dossett, right, that we both know,
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:45.720]   you know, did nine years in the SEAL teams
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.120]   and he's one of these people.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.360]   He says, you know, he's happy to go for a run or swim
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.540]   anytime between 4.30 a.m. and 6 a.m.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.180]   And he'll train in the afternoon too,
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:55.780]   'cause, you know, he's a SEAL team guy
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:57.380]   and they'll do whatever anytime.
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.820]   That's part of the phenotype.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.480]   But he feels best doing that, right?
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.340]   I'm a mid, I like to exercise mid-morning.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:08.180]   And I'm happy to skip eating until 12 or one.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.180]   And I like to go to sleep around 11.30, 12,
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.020]   'cause I'm a normal human being rather than you
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:12.860]   who goes to bed at 9 p.m.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:14.100]   - What about Pat, actually?
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.980]   I've never asked him what time.
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.060]   - So Pat's ideal to sleep time,
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.800]   I've asked him this would be around 8.30 or 9.
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:21.800]   - Oh, I sound like Pat.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.880]   - No, but he has, yes, but he has two young children,
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.600]   two years old and a newborn.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.720]   And so the cycle is disrupted, right?
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.320]   - Yeah, but that's known, right?
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.460]   I mean, the effect of childbearing.
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:35.600]   And I think we could talk about this,
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.080]   that's more complicated, but that's pretty much, yeah.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.520]   - Yeah, I mean, I think we need to come up with a new name
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.840]   for a chronotype because chronotype implies
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.000]   that it's just about sleep and wake.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.820]   Being an early bird or a night owl.
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:51.220]   And what we're also talking about is how exercise
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.980]   and eating match onto those.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.980]   - And the phase of relation between them.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:56.860]   - Right.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.400]   - And the phases between different components, as you said.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.380]   - 'Cause they interact.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.220]   - Because they interact.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.040]   - Right.
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:03.480]   - And they don't have to be in the same phase.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:05.520]   Like let's say my light and food
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.960]   could be very close to each other's,
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.300]   your light and food could be different, right?
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.820]   The phases don't have to be, they can be plastic.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.100]   So you have to find this for yourself.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:17.000]   You may be a person who eats late at night,
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.900]   exercises late at night,
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:21.460]   or you may be a person who exercise early, eat later.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:25.180]   So it doesn't, as long as the phase is good,
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.300]   that's what you have to find out.
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:28.860]   - Okay, and if I understand correctly,
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.300]   when you're talking about phase relationship,
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.080]   it means you want to lump exercise, feeding, and light for--
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:34.920]   - And sleep.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.580]   - And sleep in a way that as a coherent and total system
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.140]   makes you feel really good.
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:43.260]   - Temporally in a great order.
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:44.100]   - Uh-huh.
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:44.920]   - Absolutely.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:45.760]   - Yeah, that's, and I think that--
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.500]   - And I could tell you to me,
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.180]   is literally getting exposed to sun,
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:53.940]   clearly in the morning, clearly at noon I go out,
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:57.380]   I keep my windows in the office completely open,
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:00.500]   eating mostly in the early time of the day and exercising,
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.380]   and literally at the end part of the day,
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:07.580]   I'm literally in a more thoughtful vegetative state.
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:11.180]   Like I really can't, like after five, I tell my students,
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.100]   if you want to tell me anything complicated,
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.340]   you're wasting your time.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:16.340]   My brain just doesn't function.
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:17.900]   So even though I only sleep at night,
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:21.140]   but I'm really starting to shut off, ramp down,
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:24.420]   really, I mean, it's, you know, I could send the email,
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:27.640]   talk about brainless stuff, but my power,
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.300]   my energy to do powerful stuff really dropped tremendously.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.340]   So all my students who know me very well,
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:36.980]   they put the meetings with me early in the morning
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.620]   'cause they know this is when I'm,
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:41.620]   so everything for me, and for me it's very tight,
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.020]   so it could be different, but it's very clustered
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:45.940]   in the morning, it's all tied together,
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:48.860]   and literally the remaining part seems to be just a,
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.260]   you know, vegetative state.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:54.640]   - Yeah, you and my bulldog Costello,
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.380]   who unfortunately passed away recently, had that in, yeah.
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:58.960]   - I did not, that's so sad. - Yeah, Sam and Costello
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.540]   were good friends, yeah, sorry to break it to you here.
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:04.420]   Yeah, he had a good long life and he went easy,
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:06.220]   but he had a circadian clock
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:09.740]   that basically would just sleep around 24 hours a day.
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:12.840]   - Minimal activity interspersed every third day or so.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.760]   You do have this morning vigor.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.600]   - Yes.
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.780]   - I think other people are gonna have
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.860]   more of an afternoon vigor.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.020]   Do you think that this can change across the lifespan?
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:26.460]   It's, the rumor is that teenagers
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:29.400]   naturally want to sleep in later and stay up later.
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:30.820]   Do you think that's social rhythm
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:32.500]   or do you think that that's actually biological?
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.840]   - Yeah, that's a tough question.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.380]   I mean, it could be both.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.460]   One thing that worries me is that it seems
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.960]   that if anything with age,
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.740]   this morning rigor gets stronger.
[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.580]   - You mean you want people to become more of morning?
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.900]   - More of morning. - Why is that worry you?
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:48.960]   I think that's good.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.720]   - Because for me, I'm already a very shifted morning.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:55.060]   I don't wanna be one of these 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. sleepers
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:55.900]   at some point.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.600]   - Yeah, on the other hand, it's also kind of nice
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.420]   because it's quiet and you can get work done.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:02.300]   - Yeah, but honestly, from 4.30 to 7.30
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:05.780]   when my wife wake up, it can be very lonely.
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:08.900]   Yes, you achieve a lot, but it's quiet outside.
[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:12.120]   It's, you know, so I don't wanna be at 1 a.m.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:12.960]   Let's put it this way.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.540]   - You can tell Samara is more social than I am.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.380]   - That's right.
[01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:17.220]   That is true.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.580]   - But we should touch on that actually.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:22.060]   So your wife is, she follows a different schedule.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:22.900]   - Yeah.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:26.300]   - And so the social rhythm is important.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.860]   I think, what should we do?
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.740]   How should we conceptualize
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:31.680]   and how should we adjust ourselves
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.520]   according to the social rhythm?
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.340]   - And I honestly love this hypothesis
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:39.300]   that people came up with and Pat's kids reminded me of.
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.820]   Because kids are really gonna disrupt
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:42.880]   your sleep-wake cycle.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:46.660]   It seems like there is a chrono attraction
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:48.980]   that usually people who attract each others
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:51.860]   have actually different sleep-wake schedule.
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:54.180]   And the idea being is that this allows them
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:57.500]   to take care of their kids throughout the day-night cycle.
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:58.740]   - And have a peaceful marriage.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:01.240]   - And have a peaceful marriage in a way, right?
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.460]   So, I mean, we didn't have kids me and Rachel,
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.540]   so maybe this is, but it seems like evolutionary.
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:09.940]   It makes sense that if you wanna protect your kids,
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:12.060]   you don't want everybody to be mourning rigor
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:13.660]   and then the kids don't have,
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.860]   so you want the distributed across.
[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:16.700]   It makes sense.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.860]   - It's a reasonable argument.
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.180]   I've heard that one of the reasons
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:24.640]   that people think that the clock is not exactly 24 hours,
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.420]   but is 24 hours plus or minus 20 minutes or so,
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:33.380]   is because we believe that we evolved in clans or groups
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:37.060]   or villages, whatever, that we're about 100 to 200 people.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.540]   And in order to have protection
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:41.740]   around the early morning hours
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:43.900]   when we're vulnerable to predation
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:45.460]   and in the late night hours
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:48.140]   that you would want some individuals of our species
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.040]   to be naturally more like night owls
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.260]   and some more like early people.
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:56.260]   So your theory of parenting is similar in that way.
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:59.140]   The social rhythm is a powerful rhythm though.
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.460]   Meaning if I go out and I'm tired,
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:03.980]   let's say I'm tired at like 9.30,
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:04.820]   I don't wanna go out, I'm gonna need it.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.860]   - So can I just say something about that?
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:11.380]   I think the social rhythm is powerful at the obvious levels
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:13.240]   like it affects your sleep,
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.860]   it affects how much you wake up or eat,
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:17.740]   but I'm not so sure it's as powerful
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.740]   as people think on the clock.
[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:21.760]   Now, eventually it will mess up the clock
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.720]   because now if you're doing a lot of social at night,
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.020]   getting enough light, eating at the wrong time of the day,
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:29.780]   eventually you're gonna have an effect.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:33.840]   But I don't think that's the social interactions themselves
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.260]   have been shown to affect your clock very strongly
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.380]   for some reason.
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:38.580]   - That's good to know.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:40.560]   Well, for people hearing this,
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.220]   they're probably getting the impression
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:43.540]   like I'm the night owl
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:46.420]   and then Samara is the one that's in bed at nine
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.860]   and then wakes up at four.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:51.300]   But having attended many meetings with Samara,
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:53.500]   I can tell you that he's the party animal.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.980]   So let's talk about that.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.640]   I mean, let's talk about the fact that you're the partier
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.820]   who's up until two dancing at these various meetings,
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:05.620]   which I've seen, actually a good dancer I'm told.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:10.620]   But what should we do when we do stay up very late
[01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:11.880]   for whatever reason?
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.740]   Could be because we had to take a midnight trip
[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:15.620]   to the hospital, unfortunate reason,
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:18.360]   or it could be because you're in the presence of people
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.620]   that you don't see very often
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:22.940]   and you go out for a really nice night out on the town
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:26.180]   and you get to sleep around 2.30 or three in the morning.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:29.120]   How should one get back on schedule?
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.320]   Do you force yourself to then get up and view light
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:33.440]   at the normal time that you would get up and view light
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.000]   or do you allow yourself to sleep in?
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.320]   What's the optimal protocol?
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:37.780]   - I would allow myself to sleep in
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.980]   and remember this is a long-term effect.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.600]   This is something that you live with for a long period.
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.200]   And remember I told you about the experiments
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.260]   we did with the mood.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:48.920]   These require two weeks of that light schedule
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.520]   to cause mood disturbances.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.740]   So these don't happen just in a single day.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:55.060]   - So this is the way you justify staying out late
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:55.900]   every once in a while.
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:58.060]   - Well, in the meetings you've seen me
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:00.640]   and I've done this for five or six days continuously,
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.440]   but what you didn't see that when I came back to my home,
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.960]   it took me two weeks as if I did a jet lag.
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.280]   So I really do suffer for two weeks
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.160]   after doing a six crazy night of staying up at night,
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.040]   drinking at the wrong time of the day.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.920]   So it's not that I'm completely okay with it.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.560]   When I go back, everything goes back.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.360]   It takes me actually literally two weeks to recover
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.240]   from the circadian rhythm meeting
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.900]   that you've seen me partying at some point.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.420]   - Which is kind of ironic, the circadian rhythm meeting,
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:30.600]   people are totally disrupting the circadian cycle,
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.380]   but scientists are human beings too.
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:38.380]   - So I think if you do it at very little occasions,
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.980]   I think you should not worry too much
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.860]   that this will have lasting impact.
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:45.980]   And the good news is that if you readjust your schedule,
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.200]   you could come back to it.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.320]   The problem is when you maintain these wrong schedule
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.900]   for prolonged team and becomes chronic prolonged periods
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.000]   of time, that's when you have the problems
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.160]   and the accumulation of the problems.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.360]   So when you have sleeping problem,
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.760]   you produce metabolic problem.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.000]   When you have metabolic problems,
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.860]   you produce lack of exercise
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:08.380]   and you could see how things can spiral out very quickly.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.080]   And then it would be hard to come back to it.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.000]   - Well, certainly sleep disruption is both a symptom of
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   and a cause of almost all mental health disorders, right?
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.040]   And certainly the metabolic syndromes
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.080]   that people are talking about nowadays and all of this,
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:28.040]   it all funnels back to light.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:30.040]   This is what's so remarkable.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.200]   And so we have these devices and I use my phone
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.160]   and I use my computer,
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.480]   but do you think that the mere dimming of the screen
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.480]   or not interacting with screens with say 90 minutes
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.760]   or two hours before bedtime,
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:47.560]   according to what we're saying today,
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.560]   this should have a profound effect
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.120]   on all these factors. - And it does.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.520]   And I really believe it does.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.520]   And again, I think as Pat did these inventions
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.360]   where you get a pouch,
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.880]   where you put your phone in a pouch.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:06.120]   - So what Samra's referring to is our friend, Pat,
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:10.280]   this former SEAL team member who's also a very impressive
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.760]   person in the landscape of business and family, et cetera.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.760]   A real superhuman by any regard has this habit
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.000]   of taking his phone
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.620]   and putting it into a sealed pouch in the evening.
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.560]   So it's basically--
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:26.180]   - And in his program, he sends you actually these seal,
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:27.020]   you know, batches.
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:30.280]   And so that I think is a great idea
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.400]   because not only it will take away the light from you,
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.200]   but it also take away the distraction
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.860]   because you wanna repair and recover and sleep does that.
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:42.280]   And if you have your phone dinging all the time
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.000]   or the light flashing from it,
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.640]   you're just not getting enough sleep
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.100]   and you're causing yourself major problems.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.960]   - I never asked you this,
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:56.960]   but I realize now that I should have long ago,
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.200]   but I'll ask you now.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:02.360]   Why and how did you get into all this stuff?
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:05.100]   - Yeah, I mean, honestly, I, first of all,
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.620]   I wanted to become a, you know, I wanted to study genetics
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:11.820]   and I knew I wanted to do PhD in genetics,
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:14.480]   but I only got accepted in one university at the time.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.820]   And I joined the learning and memory lab
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:18.100]   and I liked learning and memory.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:19.800]   At the beginning, I worked in the snails
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.280]   and aplasia californica
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.160]   and started looking at learning and memory.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.680]   But then the same lab was looking at these daily variation.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.400]   I was really struck,
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.000]   like you never think about it outside of science.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000]   It really struck me that organisms can measure day
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.100]   biologically, that was very shocking to me.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:41.120]   And I just really got attracted
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.520]   and I wanted to see why does this happen?
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.360]   What is the effect of different times of day?
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.680]   And I just stuck with it.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:50.100]   It's just, it was mind blowing for me
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:51.960]   who was in medical school
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:54.360]   that I've never heard about it before.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.160]   You know, it's really amazing medicine.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.920]   I think still now,
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.120]   we are very good at looking at stuff spatially,
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.600]   but we're very bad at looking at temporal aspects.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.260]   So we always, you know, like to see images, static images,
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:09.480]   spatial information.
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.280]   - Take an X-ray, measure a temperature,
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.120]   measure a blood pressure.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.840]   - Exactly, but we don't think of temporal.
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.440]   And, you know, you talk to John Huganash right now
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:20.440]   and he's telling you the importance of chrono medicine
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.000]   or chrono pharma, pharma two, whatever the word is.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.640]   And it just, it really just getting the drugs
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.940]   at the right time of the day
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:31.440]   is gonna be essential for our health.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.920]   - Do you think that's gonna come from using better trackers
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:37.280]   like aura rings, whoop straps, these kinds of things?
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.360]   - I love the trackers,
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.840]   but I think there's even more exciting discoveries.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.920]   Now you could take a single blood sample
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.600]   and measure many biological components
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.160]   and figure where you are in the circadian clock,
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.640]   something that was very hard to do before.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.480]   So if you have a marker to know where you are in the clock,
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.780]   you could actually understand more the effect of everything,
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.800]   exercise, feeding, light input.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.000]   - What is the marker?
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.480]   - So there are some papers from, what's her name,
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:07.000]   Phyllis Z and from Achim Kramer,
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.800]   where they measure multiple RNAs that are known
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:11.900]   to tell you what phase of the clock is
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:16.700]   or multiple proteins or biological reactions.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:19.200]   And depending on a combination of factor,
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.520]   not a single factor, you could tell where you are
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.400]   in the circadian clock.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.920]   So they could, instead of just measuring temperature
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.900]   or melatonin, just one measurement,
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.920]   and melatonin specifically is also complicated
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.800]   by the fact that melatonin is affected by light.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.180]   And temperature, your temperature and sleep
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.320]   can be easily dissociatable, right?
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.360]   When you travel across different times on your sleep,
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.320]   at different times in the temperature cycle.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:46.040]   So having multiple components measured
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.820]   will give you a better determination of your circadian phase
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:53.240]   and understanding your circadian phase in humans
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.040]   will tell you what is the effect of giving certain drugs
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.720]   at certain times of the circadian phase.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.320]   So in the future, this is gonna be studied
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.640]   at a much higher level when you can determine the phase
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.020]   in relation to all the other stuff.
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:12.020]   - It's striking to me that in all animals, besides humans,
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:15.280]   if they deviate too much from the appropriate exposure
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.860]   to light and light-dark cycle,
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:21.860]   they essentially don't mate and/or die and/or get killed off.
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:25.060]   But in humans, we are able to override that
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:26.600]   at least to some extent.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.660]   But the ways in which we suffer
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:33.960]   appear to be things like obesity, metabolic syndromes,
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.820]   reproductive syndromes that accompany the other syndromes,
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:38.360]   you know, endocrine syndromes,
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.220]   and mood and depressive disorders.
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:45.600]   Is there any effort at the level of the nationally
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.620]   or laboratories that you're aware of
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.340]   to try and use light in order to improve mood
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.380]   and mental health?
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:54.500]   - I mean, honestly, this is my moon shot.
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:57.180]   This is the thing that I think people,
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:42:01.340]   because I say don't take a pill, take a photon.
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:02.980]   I mean, you take pills, it's important.
[01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.860]   I'm just making it that really we have an opportunity
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:10.420]   right now with the incredible advances of LED lights,
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:15.420]   of changing spectra of light, of regulating intensities.
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:19.000]   And just for simple changes,
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.900]   you could really improve sleep-wake cycle, productivity,
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:25.540]   and still you could actually get more done.
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:27.500]   Because as we've talked about,
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.540]   when you have all these messed up,
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:32.880]   now you have to sleep more, but your sleep is fragmented.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.060]   It's not very good.
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:35.100]   - And you can't focus.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:37.420]   - And you can't focus when you don't have alertness
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:39.300]   when you need the alertness.
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:43.140]   So having all these could allow you to do even more,
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.220]   actually, at the end than less.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:47.940]   And that's the exciting part of it.
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:50.380]   - One of the questions I get asked most often about
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:51.820]   is about ADHD.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:54.120]   You know, I think there's a lot of self-prescribed
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.220]   as well as clinically prescribed ADHD.
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.860]   People are having a tremendously difficult time focusing,
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:00.540]   and not just because they're sleepy.
[01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:02.240]   They just can't seem to anchor their attention.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.140]   And there could be multiple reasons for this,
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:06.800]   but there are now several clinical trials ongoing
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:09.900]   using light to try and anchor people's attention
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:11.980]   and mood and wellbeing for sake of focus.
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:14.500]   And I think that while I love this saying
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.640]   that you mentioned, you know, take a photon, not a pill,
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:21.480]   and with due respect to the need for pharmacology
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:24.580]   for certain people, I think most people
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:27.160]   just haven't really dialed in their relationship to light
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.680]   in a way that allows them to rule out
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.580]   whether or not they need medication.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:32.620]   - Absolutely, that's the best way to put it.
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:33.860]   I can't add to that.
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:39.460]   - Let's talk about jet lag, but not in the context of,
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.640]   okay, if somebody's traveling from Europe to Japan
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.820]   or from the East Coast, because that varies tremendously,
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:46.980]   right, I mean, there's as many different variations
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:49.640]   on travel as there are individuals out there
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.420]   and with goals and jobs, et cetera.
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:55.820]   But rather, let's talk about what are the two or three things
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:59.400]   that people can do to adjust their schedule quickly?
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:01.320]   Yesterday, I called you and said,
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.040]   "Look, I know somebody who's traveling six hours."
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.440]   I won't even mention in which direction
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.120]   'cause I don't want people to anchor to that example.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:13.120]   And you described some very simple tools of viewing light
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.780]   a little bit earlier than normal
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:18.560]   and getting on the local food schedule, et cetera,
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.740]   that would allow them to shift more quickly.
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:22.920]   And the reason I want to have this conversation is yes,
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.800]   for the travelers and for the shift workers,
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:30.160]   but mostly because of the fact that you've proven
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.620]   again and again that people are disrupted
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:36.280]   in their circadian behavior at home.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:39.000]   So what are the, aside from what we've already talked about,
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.320]   how can one adjust quickly to a new schedule?
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.080]   Like let's say fall classes are starting,
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.760]   you start a new job or you have a baby
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.600]   or a puppy or whatever.
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.200]   What is the best way to shift the clock quickly?
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.560]   - So it's very simple as we've talked yesterday.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.400]   So imagine you're in the outside with no environmental,
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.100]   with no industrial light.
[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:02.060]   If your body thinks you're in early evening
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:04.940]   and you see a bright light, what does this tell you?
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.600]   Oh, wait, this is not early evening yet.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:11.160]   It's still early afternoon or late afternoon.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:14.880]   So I have to delay my clock to go back to late afternoon.
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.120]   So if you get light early in the evening,
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.040]   it delays your clock.
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:20.880]   So what does--
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.840]   - Meaning that makes you want to go to sleep later.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.000]   - Yes, it delays your clock.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.760]   So you're in New York, right?
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.760]   People in Italy have an advanced clock
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.000]   because they are six hours ahead of us.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.480]   So if you're in New York and you get light
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:39.420]   early in the evening, you delay even further from Italy.
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:42.060]   So now you're delaying away from Italy.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.560]   Now the same thing happens.
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.680]   Let's say you thought dawn came up
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.680]   and you thought it's already dawn,
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:49.760]   but it was, let's say, three o'clock in the morning
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:50.800]   or four o'clock in the morning,
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.760]   and then you get a bright light and you say,
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.760]   oh, wait a minute, dawn is not up yet,
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.360]   so I should advance my clock.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.360]   Or I'm at night, but I'm getting bright light,
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.600]   so I should run because dawn is already up.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.200]   So then later in the night, later in your night,
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.880]   and actually it just happens that the humans,
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.800]   you get a temperature in a day or later in the night,
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.520]   low temperature in your body.
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:20.020]   After that, light start advancing your clock.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.560]   So if you wanna go to Italy,
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.440]   instead of getting light early in the evening,
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:26.680]   you wanna get light after the temperature low.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:30.020]   So you could advance your clock even before you go to Italy
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:32.920]   and you're catching up to the Italians just by using light.
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.360]   It's as simple as that.
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.680]   So you could do it for every region.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.960]   You could calculate how much they are advanced of you.
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.000]   You could know how much these light shifts happen per day,
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.920]   and you can calculate what you need to do,
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:49.880]   very simple math, to adjust either in direction of delaying,
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.760]   if you're going from New York to California,
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:53.360]   you wanna delay your clock,
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.300]   or advancing if you're going from New York to Italy.
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.560]   - So in order to make that a visual,
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.200]   and because a lot of people are listening to this,
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.800]   not looking at it on video,
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:06.800]   we will put a zero cost downloadable figure of this
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.260]   on the Hubermanlab.com website related to this episode.
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:14.400]   But I think I can summarize it in language as well.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.500]   If I understand correctly, what you're saying is,
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:21.120]   if your typical wake up time is say 7 a.m.,
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.840]   then your low point in temperature probably occurs
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:25.240]   somewhere around 5 a.m.
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:29.320]   And if you view light right around then,
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.360]   it's going to essentially advance your clock.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:33.780]   - Yeah, because then your body thinks,
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:34.620]   oh, it's 7 o'clock,
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:37.020]   so it'll advance your clock by one to two hours.
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:40.780]   - But if I were to view light, say at 3 a.m.,
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:42.700]   then it would probably delay my clock.
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:43.900]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:47.180]   Yeah, so, and then let's say I land in a new schedule.
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:48.340]   I wanna adjust to a new schedule.
[01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:50.020]   Let's say I didn't manage to do anything
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:51.460]   with my light viewing before I went,
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:53.500]   and I didn't anticipate the trip.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:56.220]   Suddenly I'm on a new schedule, okay?
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.760]   I was told that one of the ways to help shift the clock
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:02.060]   and to avoid gastrointestinal issues
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:05.240]   is to eat on the local schedule,
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.220]   to start basically behaving like a local,
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:10.380]   even though your circadian clock
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:11.940]   will take a little bit of time to catch up.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:15.380]   - Absolutely, but you have to remember the light, right?
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:17.960]   So let's, now that we explained it very simply,
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:20.820]   let's take a very simple example, right?
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:23.860]   New York to Italy, that's a simple example.
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:26.780]   New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right?
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:29.620]   So let's say you fly from New York at night.
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:31.860]   You reach Italy at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:34.820]   What is the time in your New York time?
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:36.220]   Although you reach-- - Six hours back.
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:37.300]   - Six hours back. - It's two a.m.
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:38.500]   - It's two a.m.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.240]   So when you land Italy, you wanna avoid light,
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:42.140]   like the plague.
[01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:43.180]   Yeah, you could eat,
[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:44.940]   but you really don't wanna get a light.
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:45.780]   - 'Cause otherwise it's gonna delay you.
[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.300]   - It's gonna delay you, it's gonna send you to California
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:49.660]   instead of sending you to Italy.
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:51.540]   - Right, and so this is such a key point.
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:52.940]   If anyone's confused about this,
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.260]   we will put some diagrams up,
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:57.740]   but what Samir's saying is so crucial.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:00.120]   Just because getting bright light in your eyes
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.420]   early in the day is really beneficial when you're at home.
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:04.940]   When you travel to a new time zone,
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:09.480]   you have to take into account what your body thinks,
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.940]   what, excuse me, you have to take into account
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:13.460]   where your body thinks you are.
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.540]   And so if you're looking at the Italian sunrise,
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.860]   having just flown from New York to Italy,
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:19.420]   and you didn't prepare for that trip
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.600]   by waking up a little bit earlier in anticipation.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:22.440]   - Multiple days, yeah.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.660]   - And you view light at two a, excuse me,
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:27.560]   at six or seven a.m. Italian time,
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.360]   beautiful Italian sunrise,
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.060]   you are going to delay your clock.
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:33.900]   You're going to basically throw yourself back to California,
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.180]   but you are in Italy.
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:37.220]   You're gonna throw your biology back to California,
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:39.980]   and you are gonna be up in the middle of the Italian night,
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:42.380]   and you're gonna be miserable.
[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:44.100]   I'll tell a brief anecdote,
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:46.740]   'cause I called Samir in desperation.
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:49.980]   A few years ago, I traveled to Abu Dhabi, NYU Abu Dhabi,
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:51.980]   to give a seminar, 12 hours out of phase.
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:55.140]   It's a 12-hour flip, and I thought I could just muscle it.
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:56.860]   I thought I'll get up, just view sunlight
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:58.300]   when the sun comes up.
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:02.020]   And I fell apart mentally and physically.
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:04.280]   And Samir came to my rescue.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.120]   I called him.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:06.040]   I said, "I don't know what to do."
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.720]   And he said, "Go to the gym,
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.540]   went at the local dawn,
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:14.940]   work out, eat,
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:18.340]   and then view sunlight starting the next day."
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:19.880]   And that basically got me onto schedule.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.160]   So I used food and exercise to adjust myself
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:24.040]   because my light viewing activity
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.500]   was just completely out of whack.
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:28.100]   - Yeah, I mean, and we talked about other details.
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:31.020]   So you have to calculate it, but you're absolutely right.
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:34.100]   I mean, it's very important
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:36.760]   to avoid getting the wrong light information
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:38.340]   when you're trying to adjust your body,
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:41.800]   because otherwise it shifts you to the other side.
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.200]   Absolutely right.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.420]   - Well, you are one of these people that has such vigor.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:49.060]   It's one of these things where,
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:50.220]   having known you all these years,
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:53.860]   you have a tremendous capacity for work and for soccer
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:56.980]   and for arguing, respectful arguing.
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:50:58.500]   And, you know, sometimes, you know-
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:50:59.860]   - It's getting worse with age.
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:01.800]   - Yeah, well, we could talk about that offline,
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.420]   but I think a lot of your vigor
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:06.840]   and a lot of your ability to work hard and focus
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:10.180]   and really do so many things at an impressive level
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:11.780]   is because you think about these issues
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:14.920]   and you think about when you're going to be optimal
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:17.420]   for focus, when you're going to be optimal for exercise,
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.860]   when, and the when is the key.
[01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:22.460]   It's, and I think a lot of people live in the landscape
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:25.140]   of feeling like there's something broken inside them
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:27.140]   because they can't focus or they can't do it.
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:27.980]   - Subconscious, right?
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:29.980]   Remember, it's all subconscious.
[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:32.140]   These effects, and you're absolutely right.
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:35.180]   Now, honestly, joking aside about age,
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:37.940]   I really agree with you that I think part of the reason
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.980]   I'm continuing to be able to do this,
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:42.120]   that I really think about it
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:45.340]   and I make sure that I keep everything aligned.
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:47.620]   And that actually helps me a lot.
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:49.900]   Like I don't suffer in sleep.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:51.140]   I don't suffer in waking up.
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:53.560]   I never use a timer to wake up.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.140]   I mean, people say, aren't you scared?
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.940]   Like you have to give a lecture at eight or 730.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:58.780]   Honestly, I was like,
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:01.080]   there is no way I'm going to go beyond that.
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:02.500]   It just, even if I try,
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:05.680]   I can't sleep beyond 6 a.m. in my regular times.
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:07.400]   It's just, it's not going to happen.
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:10.720]   By 4.30, my eyes are wide awake and I'm in bed.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:14.540]   It's just, system is so aligned, it works.
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:18.320]   - A lot of times people will say, how come I go to sleep?
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:19.400]   I fall asleep, fine.
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:21.160]   But then I wake up at three or four in the morning
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.720]   and can't fall back asleep.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.200]   Is it possible that those people
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:26.320]   were supposed to go to bed at 8 p.m.?
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.200]   - It's possible.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.760]   I mean, it is possible.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:31.560]   It is also possible that sometimes people will wake up
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.720]   and go back to sleep.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:35.480]   But yeah, I mean, it is possible.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:38.560]   Or it's possible that their clock is completely misaligned,
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.500]   that they are getting maybe a nap time at night
[01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:42.340]   when they are supposed,
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:44.400]   and then they possibly feel so sleepy in the day.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:46.880]   So all these are possible combinations.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.600]   - Well, that's an interesting idea and considered.
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.680]   So what they think is their sleep,
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:53.520]   their body is so out of whack with the light-dark cycle
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:55.160]   that it's actually a nap.
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:57.080]   - Or the weaker part of the sleep.
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.640]   I mean, you see this when you travel to different time zones
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.240]   before you adjust.
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.920]   You go to sleep really well,
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:06.360]   but two hours later, you're fully up.
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:07.320]   Two hours.
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:09.840]   If you were so tired and this is your regular sleep,
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:13.260]   there's no way you're gonna wake up in two hours.
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:16.360]   So then you feel very sleepy later in the day
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.260]   or something like that.
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:20.620]   So it depends on how your whole system is aligned
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:21.580]   to the environment.
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:23.100]   - That's a very interesting idea.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:26.860]   I think that's gonna resonate with a lot of people.
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:30.580]   I wake up every morning around three or four.
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:32.460]   I generally use the bathroom
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:34.700]   and then I fall back asleep very deeply.
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:37.360]   It doesn't seem to disrupt my daytime wakefulness.
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:40.340]   And I think a lot of people obsess over that waking up
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:41.780]   and worry there's something wrong.
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.780]   Provided they can go back to sleep, it's okay.
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:46.540]   - If you can't go use the bathroom, go back to sleep,
[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:48.100]   that should not be a problem.
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:50.300]   Maybe some people, when they go to use the bathroom,
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:51.540]   they use very bright light
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:53.660]   and then they get an alerting signal.
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:57.120]   So if you, maybe that's, it could be as simple as that,
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:57.960]   that affects you.
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:00.380]   Maybe when you wake up, you put tons of light
[01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:02.460]   or you start reading your iPad.
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:04.140]   So there's all these combination
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.660]   that we still don't know about
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:08.020]   that could be affecting their sleep wake rhythms
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:10.380]   and their sleep maintenance.
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:13.460]   - Do you use melatonin or do you take melatonin?
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:14.700]   - I don't need it, to be honest.
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:16.900]   In my case, there is no reason to use it
[01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:20.820]   because I could guarantee you that by maybe eight o'clock,
[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:23.100]   my melatonin has already started to go up.
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:25.600]   And by the time I sleep, my melatonin is very high
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:29.100]   because I don't use a lot of lights after sunset.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:30.660]   - And light inhibits melatonin.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:33.480]   - And life really blocks melatonin level.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:36.460]   - You hear this myth that the pineal gland
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:38.300]   calcifies as we get older.
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:39.660]   Is that, do you know anything about that?
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:40.980]   - I mean, I've heard about that,
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.700]   but I don't know what does, I mean,
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:45.460]   there is not very clear evidence that affects the sleep.
[01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:47.500]   I don't know much about it, to be honest.
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.100]   - The evidence that I've seen is that, yes,
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:51.220]   there's some calcification around the pineal,
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:53.800]   just because of where it sits in the brain.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.740]   It's close to some bony structures,
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:54:59.500]   but I don't think there's any evidence
[01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.620]   that it has negative effects.
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:04.580]   - I mean, if you still have, you could measure melatonin
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:06.060]   and that should tell you if it has any,
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:08.060]   it's such an easy thing to do.
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:11.100]   - I think this is more of a internet wellness thing
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:14.380]   that got outside the cage.
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:15.440]   - I think you're absolutely right.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.060]   - Yeah, it sounds terrible calcification
[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:20.140]   of the thing, right?
[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:21.260]   - The hard thing, right?
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:22.380]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:26.060]   Let's talk about seasonality a little bit.
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:31.240]   I learned, and I don't know if this is still true,
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:37.160]   but that most suicides occur in April, in the spring.
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:38.780]   I think there's a poem that says,
[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.460]   "April is the cruelest month."
[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:42.220]   I think it is the poem begins.
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:47.220]   Are there data that suicides are more frequent
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:48.620]   at particular times of year?
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:50.820]   And if so, is the spring that time of year?
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:53.060]   - Yeah, I mean, a lot of people talk about this.
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:57.040]   And one of the hypothesis is that the winter months
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.600]   that are very bad for mood,
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:02.020]   make people not wanting to do anything.
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:05.540]   And they get into such deep level of depression
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:07.100]   that when the sun comes up,
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.960]   they get actually the energy to act on their depression,
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:12.760]   which sounds really terrible, and it is terrible.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:13.840]   - It's terrible.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.100]   - So that's the idea that the lack of light
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.100]   throughout the winter caused them to go into such depression
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:21.720]   that they don't feel like doing anything.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:25.060]   Then when the light comes in with rigor in the spring,
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:28.220]   it gives them that, after all the depression they suffered,
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:33.220]   gives them that push to take that sad final act, I guess.
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:36.020]   - What other seasonal effects
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:37.460]   have been demonstrated in humans?
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:40.500]   - Yeah, I mean, I think in humans, it's not very clear
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.520]   because we don't think about seasonality.
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:45.480]   But if you start thinking about us,
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:48.760]   I think we go through major seasonal changes, I really do.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:51.760]   I think our eating pattern change across the year,
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:54.600]   I could tell you that me thinking about this,
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.520]   there's a clear changes that happens to me across the year.
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:00.880]   But for animals, this is really essential.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:05.360]   Because for animals, they have to time their mating behavior
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.000]   was when they deliver their progeny
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.760]   in the most abundant amount of food.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:13.980]   And artificial light is causing major disruption
[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:16.640]   because if you change the way these animals
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:19.020]   are receiving the light information,
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:22.120]   they either start mating much earlier or much later,
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:25.860]   and their numbers dwindle and they get into the dangers
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:29.020]   of really completely getting eliminated or extinct.
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:31.480]   - Well, human birth rates are definitely going down.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.940]   I mean, in the US in particular.
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:35.320]   - Some areas, not others.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.440]   - Not others, right.
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:41.380]   But are there other effects of seasonality on humans
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:42.820]   that we are aware of?
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.380]   - Honestly, like you could see it.
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:46.820]   Honestly, you could see it perfectly, I think,
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:48.300]   in Scandinavia.
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:51.300]   I mean, you could talk to people who live in.
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:53.080]   - Sure, they get seasonal depression.
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:54.620]   - What seasonal depression is one,
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.980]   but actually when you start asking them questions,
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:58.580]   they tell you like in the winter,
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:00.580]   they barely could wake up.
[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:03.500]   They barely have the energy before even depression.
[01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:05.940]   Even people who don't get seasonal depression,
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:08.060]   they'll tell you our energy level is lower.
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:11.260]   Our ability to go to work is not the same.
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:14.980]   And in the summer, most people actually sleep very little.
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:19.220]   They tell you we really can, we feel like we're manic.
[01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:21.260]   We have all this energy.
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:23.700]   And not in a negative way, in a funny way, right?
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:27.100]   I mean, but if you wanna sleep, we have to put this curtain.
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.140]   I think in these situations,
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:32.580]   you could really appreciate the seasonality of humans.
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:35.580]   I think we kind of destroyed our seasonality
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:39.740]   because we don't get exposed to that much natural light.
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:41.420]   We have all this artificial light.
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:43.260]   But I think, honestly,
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:45.380]   one of the things that is gonna happen
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:47.320]   if they follow your recommendations
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.640]   about giving light at the same time,
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:51.100]   giving food, giving exercise.
[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:52.660]   - Let's be clear, those are your recommendations.
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:54.220]   - Well, I mean. - No, I'm just,
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:56.060]   I'm just in fair attribution.
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:58.500]   - What I'm saying is that this is gonna cause them
[01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:01.660]   to also experience some changes across the season.
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:04.900]   Because now, they're gonna see the sun differently.
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:07.400]   If you're gonna go out in the morning,
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:09.500]   in the summer, you're gonna get a much brighter,
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.180]   that's why I don't like the change in time.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:14.620]   I know people think, oh, because you're biased, you,
[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:16.060]   'cause I think-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:16.900]   Sorry, the change now,
[01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:18.180]   are you talking about daylight savings?
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:20.500]   - Daylight savings, it's such a bad idea
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:24.160]   because it disrupts that rhythm that you're having.
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:27.040]   'Cause I think your body, if you keep that rhythm,
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.820]   you will see the whole seasonality.
[01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:32.180]   And I look at it from a different aspect than other people.
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:34.180]   It really, and people say I'm biased
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:37.140]   because I'm a morning person, and it may be true.
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:39.900]   But there's situation-- - Secret conspiracy
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:42.240]   about morning people. - Yeah, but there is,
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:44.980]   if you think about it, Andrew, there is a situation
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:47.620]   where you're getting light perfectly well,
[01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:50.640]   and then all of a sudden, they delay it by one hour.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:53.020]   And then, even though it's the summer,
[01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:55.620]   your body now, if you're still not adjusting,
[01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:57.380]   think, oh, wait, what happened?
[01:59:57.380 --> 01:59:58.500]   What kind of happened?
[01:59:58.500 --> 01:59:59.740]   - Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:03.080]   because I always thought, what's the big deal?
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.180]   One hour, right?
[02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:05.780]   One hour shift, spring forward, fall back.
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:07.980]   - It's so hard to adjust to one hour action.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:11.660]   - But this goes back to the beginning of our discussion.
[02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:13.700]   It's not just one hour. - Right.
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:16.120]   - Because it's one hour across that one day,
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:18.500]   but there's this cumulative effect on the clock
[02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:22.900]   and these three elements of your tripartite model,
[02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:25.880]   the homeostatic, sleep, and the direct effects on mood.
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:27.220]   - And when it's so close,
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:31.140]   it's sometimes hard to figure out how to adjust it perfectly
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:34.580]   because we're already sleep deprived in our society.
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:36.700]   And then you shift it by,
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:40.700]   so it just, it all accumulates and it has no benefit.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:42.820]   - Well, you work at a major government organization,
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:44.220]   National Institute of Mental Health.
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:46.080]   Why don't we campaign for-
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:47.580]   - Honestly, I have no idea.
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:48.420]   I mean, it makes no sense.
[02:00:48.420 --> 02:00:50.020]   - No, I'm saying, why don't we go campaign?
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:51.000]   - Yeah, I would love to.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.420]   I mean, it makes no sense to have the summer light
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:57.820]   goes up at 9 p.m., the light goes down
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:59.820]   where I live in Baltimore at 9 p.m.,
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:01.320]   and then all of a sudden,
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:04.860]   when you really want to see the light longer in the day,
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:06.540]   you now shift the other way,
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:08.380]   and now it goes all of a sudden at 6 p.m.
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:10.060]   Why do you do these drastic changes?
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:14.060]   Well, let it blend across the whole season.
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:16.140]   Yes, later, earlier at night,
[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:17.980]   but it's at least consistent.
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:20.120]   It goes in a very consistent manner.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:22.060]   I just don't understand why they do this.
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:23.360]   It makes no sense.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:25.840]   - Well, I think that the reason they do it
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:28.320]   is because they don't understand the biology,
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:30.260]   because one hour seems trivial
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:33.040]   unless you understand the repercussions
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:34.480]   of that one hour shift,
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.760]   because what's also clear now based on what you're saying
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:41.020]   is that that one hour shift is taking you out of alignment
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:42.660]   with the natural light-dark cycle
[02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:44.820]   in exactly the wrong direction.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:48.260]   - It's pushing people to get even later in the summer
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:51.000]   when light is going to push you later anyway.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.160]   It doesn't make sense.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:53.120]   You put it beautifully.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.300]   I just rambled, and this is-
[02:01:55.300 --> 02:01:56.820]   - No, no, you made it clear.
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:59.420]   - I mean, it's like literally it made you,
[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:02.060]   it made people who are having problem
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:05.220]   having an advanced sleep rhythm because they are delayed.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:08.140]   Now you give them this hour to make them even more delayed.
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:10.860]   You push them even later in the day-night cycle.
[02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:13.280]   It just doesn't make sense at all.
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:16.620]   - I think 2022 should be the year
[02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:18.980]   that we abolish bad daylight savings.
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:20.480]   - That would be the day for me, honestly.
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:24.060]   - Well, also if it has a positive effect
[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:28.940]   on what is essentially an epidemic of mental health issues
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:31.860]   and other issues related to improper interactions
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:36.860]   with light, that I think is a well worthwhile cause.
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:38.900]   - Absolutely, absolutely. - And we can explore.
[02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:41.040]   So for once, we're going to fight with some,
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:43.260]   with another group, a common battle
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:44.100]   as opposed to with one another.
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:46.100]   - I mean, the circadian people, honestly,
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:48.340]   to give them credit have been trying for years
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:49.980]   to abolish daylight savings.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:52.400]   - Yeah, the problem is they all go to sleep at 9 p.m.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:54.400]   and wake up at 4 a.m. so we never see them.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:55.720]   - That's right, that's right.
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:59.200]   - No, the circadian community has done an amazing job
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.840]   of figuring out what we need.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:05.520]   And then the challenge of course is making sure
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.360]   that people get what they need
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:09.720]   and making sure that at a societal level,
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:12.120]   we're not vaulting ourselves into the wrong direction.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.440]   - The biggest problem is that the late waking people,
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:18.200]   they think that really,
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.660]   and I'm going to try to put it in a better way now,
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.680]   they think, oh, because you're a morning person,
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:24.100]   you want to see the sun early,
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:27.300]   so you want me to suffer it dropping late.
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:29.020]   But that's not the case,
[02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:32.740]   because what happens is when they shift it back
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.620]   after the daylight saving,
[02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:36.780]   now they're going to make you suffer really badly
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:39.420]   because now it's going to be earlier.
[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:40.340]   - Right, in the fall.
[02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:42.220]   - In the fall when there's not enough light.
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:43.800]   If they keep it the same way,
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.260]   so try to convince them that actually this at the end
[02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:50.100]   causes more trouble when you need the light
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:54.440]   for your late schedule in the fall when they shift it back.
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:56.980]   Then they say keep it daylight saving all the time.
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:59.200]   And that has been proven.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.660]   That is very bad.
[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:02.160]   Like people have done studies
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:05.240]   that literally two areas close to each other
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:08.460]   and areas that were the whole year on daylight saving
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:10.520]   has much more problems,
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:12.580]   even in cancer rates and depression.
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:14.080]   So you don't want to do that.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.840]   So that's what trying to convince people
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:20.240]   that you need to prevent that switch
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:22.800]   and you don't need daylight saving at all.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:25.080]   That's where the problem happens.
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:26.180]   - Interesting.
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:27.860]   I had not thought about that,
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:30.260]   but yes, you late risers that in the fall,
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:32.860]   when they fall back, as they say,
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:35.240]   spring forward, fall back, you dial back the clock,
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:39.520]   it's really compounding the problem that already exists.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:42.360]   - And it's really nice if you keep it consistent.
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.880]   In the spring, when you get the equinox
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:47.920]   and then the days start going up
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:50.000]   and then even in the summer start going down
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.420]   and then the fall, you get the other equinox and go back.
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:54.600]   So it's very symmetrical, right?
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:57.880]   It goes into short day, longer, long, long, long,
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.440]   then short day again.
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.340]   But now you're getting these bumps
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:04.120]   in both sides of the spring and fall.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:05.160]   Why would you do that?
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:07.440]   Something that is beautifully symmetrical,
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:10.000]   beautifully smooth, you're putting bumps into it.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.080]   - Well, and we, not just beautiful because it's there,
[02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:14.880]   but evolved.
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:16.640]   I mean, essentially this is the system we evolved in
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:18.800]   for hundreds of thousands of years.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.320]   - Even apart from the exact equator,
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:23.660]   every part of the earth has seasonality.
[02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:26.740]   - I want to briefly touch on something
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:29.720]   which is individual and genetic variation
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:31.840]   in sensitivity to light.
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:36.840]   So not chronotype, but first of all, a very basic question.
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:42.200]   Do people with light eyes, light colored eyes,
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:43.760]   are they more sensitive to light
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:46.000]   than people with darker pigmented eyes?
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.640]   - I mean, honestly, it makes sense they will be more
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:51.320]   because if you think of my dark pupil,
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.760]   it's blocking more light.
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:56.640]   So if you have light pupil, yes, for vision,
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:58.000]   it may not be very obvious,
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.440]   but for something that is measuring the amount of light,
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:02.380]   you're getting more light than me.
[02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:06.340]   So you'll probably need less light to be effective
[02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:08.600]   as somebody who's darker.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:11.680]   And that maybe could explain why sometimes lighter people
[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:14.040]   say I don't want to go into very bright conditions
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.460]   because it's really bright.
[02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:18.120]   - Yeah, I can't even be at a cafe
[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:20.800]   without one of these reflective tables, like a metal table,
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:22.560]   unless I have very dark sunglasses on.
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:23.400]   - Exactly. - It's so bright,
[02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:24.540]   it's painful for me.
[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:25.800]   Whereas some people like you,
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:28.200]   we've sat outside and had meals and you're like, fine.
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:31.280]   I assumed it was kind of Jordanian toughness versus...
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:33.440]   - It's really the pupil blocks more light.
[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:36.200]   So I think it is possible that it's as simple
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:39.040]   as the pupil blocking more light can have sensitivity.
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.480]   But your question also goes deeper.
[02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:44.520]   Are there more sensitivity differences?
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:45.900]   And my understanding would be,
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:47.880]   I would think that it may be,
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:50.760]   it depends on how effective your cells are
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:54.860]   in responding to light, how healthy your IPRGCs are.
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:58.160]   So I would, but there's not many studies to show that.
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:00.400]   What is really clear that is happening
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:03.480]   is that patients with bipolar,
[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:06.000]   they seem to have different sensitivities to light.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.760]   So it seems that at least people who have
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:12.360]   psychological changes,
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:15.420]   they may have differences to the sensitivity of light.
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:16.920]   So...
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:20.000]   - Where are those differences in a particular direction?
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.400]   - I don't remember the exact...
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.440]   - We'll have to, we can look it up.
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:23.540]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:07:23.540 --> 02:07:24.380]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:27.440]   - And people have heard me say this ad nauseum
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:29.240]   to the point where they actually roll their eyes,
[02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:32.160]   but that these are the only two pieces of brain,
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:33.320]   I'm pointing to my eyes folks,
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:35.020]   that are outside the cranial vault.
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:37.720]   They are two pieces of brain that basically inform
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:40.920]   the brain about whether or not to be alert or asleep.
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:43.080]   But you can imagine that those two little pieces of brain
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:46.520]   that we call eyes would have genetic variations.
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:49.200]   Of course, eye color is genetically modular,
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:50.380]   is that determined?
[02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:53.280]   That there would be genetic variations
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:55.960]   based on whether or not your ancestry evolved
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:59.020]   near the equator or further from the equator, right?
[02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:01.200]   I mean, you see more blue eyes in Scandinavia
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:02.040]   than you do in the equator. - Absolutely.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.400]   I mean, it's the lack of light
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:06.020]   that said you need less inhibition
[02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:07.620]   because there's not enough light, right?
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:10.020]   So that's the idea of the change in color.
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:13.680]   So yeah, I totally agree with you.
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:16.840]   I mean, I think this is an area that will be studied later
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:19.580]   and will be empirically determined.
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:22.160]   The problem we have in this field right now,
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:24.360]   which I think is the biggest problem,
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.700]   is we don't have a way to measure
[02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:29.200]   the IP RGC sensitivities in humans.
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:33.300]   So we still, like it's easy to measure your rod cone function
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:35.040]   if you go to an optometrist,
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.960]   they measure all the details, right?
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.680]   Contrast detection. - You look at the chart,
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:40.420]   you look at the Snellen chart,
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:42.260]   you look at the letters of the DMV, yeah.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:44.560]   - But for the non subconscious,
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.640]   we still don't have a good measuring systems
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:50.600]   to figure out what is Andrew's sensitivity?
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:51.900]   What is Samer's sensitivity?
[02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:53.380]   What is this person's sensitivity?
[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:56.560]   And I think we're starting to work on something like that
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.320]   to hopefully develop these techniques,
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:00.260]   but till we develop them,
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:02.440]   it's gonna be very hard to figure out
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:04.140]   if there is a sensitivity difference,
[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:07.560]   how do they relate on men and women,
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:10.060]   you know, dark and light and all that,
[02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:13.240]   you know, normal versus psychologically effect
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:14.480]   and stuff like that.
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.120]   - Fascinating.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:19.940]   And every time you talk, I learned so much.
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:24.440]   It's like in the best way, the best sense of the term,
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:27.420]   it's a waterfall of knowledge.
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:28.780]   As a final question,
[02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:32.500]   I have a question about sensitivity of a whole other kind.
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:36.500]   And that's the sensitivity to spicy food.
[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:38.960]   Now, the reason I'm asking this question,
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:41.460]   what seemingly out of the blue is that
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:45.300]   I made the mistake once of having Samer cook for me.
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:48.420]   And I said, not too spicy.
[02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:50.640]   And he said, okay, not too spicy.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:52.600]   He actually said, okay, not too spicy.
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:55.700]   And it almost killed me.
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:57.940]   Like it was like two or three days.
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:00.740]   So you know a lot about biology
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:02.860]   outside the visual system, light, et cetera.
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:04.200]   You've been around a while.
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:10.380]   Are there known genetic or inherited of any kind sensitivities
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:14.200]   to spicy food, to things like red peppers and capsaicin?
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.040]   Because what you call mild,
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:20.420]   my friend almost put me into the hospital.
[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:23.000]   - I think this is similar to you swimming in the ocean
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.420]   and I need to get developed.
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:25.460]   - Okay, true, true.
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:27.680]   I like cold water swims and Samer's not a fan,
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:29.180]   but that's going to change.
[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:31.380]   It's adaptable, that's going to change.
[02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:32.680]   - That's my belief.
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:34.720]   Before I met Reiji, I was like you.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:37.480]   And once I started eating a lot of spicy food,
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.560]   I lost touch of how spicy my food is.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:43.240]   So I nearly killed you, Andrew, and I apologize.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:44.080]   - I forgive you.
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:45.460]   So basically what you're saying is that marriage
[02:10:45.460 --> 02:10:46.320]   toughened you up.
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:48.240]   - Toughened me up, exactly.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:49.700]   - Maybe that's the solution.
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:51.380]   - That's what you need, yeah.
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:55.240]   - Samer, this has been an amazing march
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:57.240]   through the importance of light,
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:59.520]   not just for regulating sleep and wakefulness,
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:03.560]   but also for food timing, the interactions with mood,
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:05.580]   the interactions with exercise.
[02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:08.760]   I'm certain that people are going to start thinking
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:11.240]   about how to change their relationship with light
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:14.700]   as a way to anchor everything that they do
[02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:16.240]   and that's important to their health.
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:18.480]   And I just, on behalf of all of them,
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:20.800]   and just directly from me as your friend
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:23.420]   and as a colleague for many years now,
[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.400]   I just want to say thank you
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:26.160]   for the incredible work you're doing
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:27.560]   and for sharing it with us.
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:28.400]   - Thank you so much.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.840]   And I actually now thinking about all of this,
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.600]   and you said I should write a book.
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:35.640]   I should write a book and call it the tripartite model.
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:38.440]   I think that would put all these components together
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:41.400]   would be very interesting to do at some point.
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:42.960]   - You should write a book.
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:44.640]   You should write, they'll probably try and change the title
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:47.160]   to like "Food, Mood and You," you know,
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:50.000]   or something because, but you can put in little print
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.520]   on the tripartite model or whatever.
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:55.220]   But regardless of what it's called,
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:57.020]   you absolutely should write a book.
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:00.440]   And so if you'd like Samir to write a book,
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:01.780]   or if you'd like to learn more about him,
[02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.640]   let's talk a little bit about where people can find you.
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:05.220]   Your laboratory is at the National Institutes
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:06.360]   of Mental Health.
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:07.960]   He is head of the Chronobiology Unit,
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.980]   all these things that I've mentioned earlier,
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:13.480]   but you are active on Twitter and Instagram.
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:14.320]   - Right.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:15.920]   - So what is your Twitter handle?
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:18.480]   - It's @samirhattar.
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:20.760]   - And we will provide a link for that in the show notes.
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:23.640]   - Sorry, yes, the Twitter @samirhattar,
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:26.020]   and I think the same for Instagram, actually.
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:28.580]   - And Samir has been coaxed onto Instagram,
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:30.400]   so he does post from time to time,
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:34.140]   mostly pictures of food that is incredibly spicy,
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:37.840]   but also information about chronobiology.
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:40.020]   He comes on for an Instagram Live every once in a while
[02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:42.560]   with me, and so definitely give him a follow there
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:46.880]   and on Twitter, and I'm sure that he'll be happy
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:51.880]   to answer questions and entertain any and all discussions
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:53.720]   about chronobiology.
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:57.240]   - Absolutely, yeah, and light, yeah.
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:12:58.340]   - Great, thank you, Samir.
[02:12:58.340 --> 02:12:59.880]   - Awesome, thank you, Andrew.
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:02.200]   - Thank you for joining me for my conversation
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:03.720]   with Dr. Samir Hattar.
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:08.020]   I hope you found it as interesting and informative as I did.
