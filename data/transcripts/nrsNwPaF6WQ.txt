[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm reading Psalm 141 from the Legacy Standard Bible, a Psalm of David.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.720]   O Yahweh, I call upon you, hasten to me.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.840]   Give ear to my voice when I call to you.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.560]   May my prayer be established as incense before you, the lifting up of my hands as the evening
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.280]   offering.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.260]   Set a guard, O Yahweh, over my mouth.
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.440]   Keep watch over the door of my lips.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.640]   Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds in wickedness with men who
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.960]   are workers of iniquity.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.720]   And do not let me eat of their delicacies.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.440]   Let the righteous smite me in loving kindness and reprove me; it is oil upon my head.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.640]   Let not my head refuse it, for still my prayer is against their evil deeds.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.240]   Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the cliffs, and they hear my words, for
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.000]   they are pleasant.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.280]   As when one plows and splits open the earth, our bones have been scattered at the mouth
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.060]   of Sheol.
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.680]   From my eyes or toward you, O Yahweh, O Lord, in you I take refuge.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.160]   Do not pour out my soul to death.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.620]   Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, and from the snares of workers
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.680]   of iniquity.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.200]   Let the wicked fall into their own nets, as for myself, meanwhile, I am passing by.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   "
