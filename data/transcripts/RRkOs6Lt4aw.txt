[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Robert in Peachtree City, Georgia asks, "What is the biblical definition of gossip?"
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   This is good for me to think about. I hate gossip, and I wasn't even sure how to define it.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   That's very dangerous, isn't it? So Romans 1, "They're full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   They are gossips, slander." So you see the context of it. Deceit, maliciousness, slander.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   It's really ugly, and it's right in there with things that hurt people.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Same thing in 2 Corinthians 12. "They may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit."
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   So there it is, back to back with slander again. So gossip is something hurtful.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's something that damages community, damages people.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Same thing again in 1 Timothy 5. Besides that, he's talking about some women in the church at that time
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   were going about from house to house, not only idlers, but also gossips and busybodies.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And there you hear the fact that it seems to be the kind of thing that you just fall into
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   when you don't have anything better to do.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   So here are a couple of things that seem to mark what gossiping is.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Number one, a negative spirit that is more bent on hurting than helping.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Gossip is not something that's really redemptive.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   "I just want to help. I want to do good, so I'm going to gossip."
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But it is deceptive. There are people who can deceive themselves into thinking they're doing good
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   by chattering away about somebody and saying, "Well, no, let's pray for that."
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And what they really are is getting pleasure out of the sharing of the negative news.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And the other thing is it's an excessive interest in affairs that belong to others.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's just not our business. Paul calls them busybodies.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   They're intruding themselves where they don't belong.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And I would add a third thing from my own experience. There's a kind of pride.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I just know this from myself. I think John Piper's pride is what makes him savor that I know something
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   somebody else doesn't know. I know it, and I can tell you.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And I feel in the know, which kind of elevates me a little bit.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So I think it's pride at the root of that.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So there's a negative spirit that's not helpful or loving or kind.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   There's an excessive interest in the busybody affairs of others.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And then there's this pride. So here's the way I would define it.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And I get part of this right out of the dictionary of the Greek term for this.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Derogatory information about someone that you have that is shared with others
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and a tone of confidentiality that is not motivated by doing good to them
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   and that you are enjoying in a way that shows your heart is not humble.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And the remedy for that kind of gossip is love.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Love for the person, love for the church and her unity, love for Jesus,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   whose fellowship is sweet enough so you don't need to have all the titillation
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   that comes from these unclean pleasures of spreading negative information.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So it seems gossip is not limited to false statements, right?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It seems like gossip can be spreading true information as well.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It can be true, but it's almost always negative.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's almost always our scuttlebutt.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   But yeah, it may be true.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   The fact that you're telling the truth doesn't mean you're not gossiping.
