[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.320]   Welcome back to the podcast on this Wednesday.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.940]   As many of you know, I don't only produce this podcast,
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.040]   I also write books.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.600]   And back in 2011, I was honored to write my very first book
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.300]   called Lit on the topic of book reading,
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.640]   one of my passions, and answering the questions,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.240]   why do we read books anyways,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.320]   and how can we read them better, things like that.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.200]   And in my research stage for the book,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.720]   I set aside one full day for one purpose,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.640]   to ransack the vast John Piper archive of online content,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.480]   to collect everything that he's ever said
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.120]   on the topic of reading.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.920]   And I found quite a lot actually,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.360]   including one amazing quote from Pastor John back in 1981.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.080]   And I wanna share with you that quote today, quote,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.880]   "What I've learned from about 20 years of serious reading
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.280]   "is this," Piper said,
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.280]   "is that sentences change my life, not books.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.020]   "What changes my life is some new glimpse of truth,
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.220]   "some powerful challenge,
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.000]   "some resolution to a longstanding dilemma.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.660]   "And these usually come concentrated in a sentence or two.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.740]   "I do not remember 99% of what I read,
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.620]   "but if the 1% of each book or article I do remember
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.960]   "is life-changing insight,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.880]   "then I don't begrudge the 99%."
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.060]   I love that quote, it's an amazing find obviously.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.160]   And that went in my 2011 book.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.000]   The quote itself was buried in a now 40-year-old manuscript,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.180]   I mean, really buried.
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.540]   The moment I found it,
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.940]   I remember running an online search
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.120]   and couldn't find any reference to this quote
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.700]   on any websites or blogs or in any published books
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.180]   or in any social media.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.920]   I mean, there was no audio recording of the message either.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520]   It was buried.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.320]   All we had was the written manuscript at DesiringGod.org.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.780]   It was either not recorded
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.060]   or the message recording got lost to time.
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.440]   So we thought until very recently,
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.960]   well, it was recorded and we just found the audio recording
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.220]   from 1981, it's now online for the first time ever
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.300]   at DesiringGod.org.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.880]   And I get the honor today of unveiling that recording
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700]   to you on APJ.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.340]   Here's the setting.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.620]   In 1981, a young Pastor John Piper
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.960]   wanted to instill hope
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.300]   in his Sunday school teachers of his church.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.640]   Those teachers get one hour with kids
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.780]   and then the rest of the week,
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.800]   those kids just watch hour after hour of television.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.380]   So isn't it hopeless to think that one hour
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.200]   of Sunday school can accomplish anything lasting
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.540]   in these young lives so saturated
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.200]   with other media all week long?
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.300]   No.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.140]   And here's why.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.060]   - I've heard often the contrast made
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.060]   between spending an hour in Sunday school once a week
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.320]   and watching television about 20 hours a week.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.100]   And the implication or the point that's usually made
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.180]   is that there's scarcely any hope
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.740]   that in this one hour on Sunday morning,
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.740]   we can counteract the fairly secularist humanist viewpoint
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.220]   that is whether overtly or covertly
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.460]   ministered through the television set.
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.920]   That sort of observation creates what I call
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.700]   quantitative hopelessness.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.460]   It gives the impression that life changing impact
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.260]   and influence is directly proportionate
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.260]   to the quantity of time spent under a particular influence.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.060]   And I think that this way of assessing
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.340]   the value of influences on our young people
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.340]   as well as ourselves as adults is wrong for two reasons.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.520]   I think it's wrong first because it obscures
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.120]   the problem with evil.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.040]   And then secondly, I think it's wrong
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   because it obscures the power of a holy moment.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.480]   And I'll try to explain what I mean
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.280]   by each of those two mistakes.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   First of all, it obscures this quantitative way of thinking.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.140]   Obscures the problem with evil in the world.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.680]   It gives the misleading impression
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.740]   that the approach to take towards harmful influences,
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.740]   say on television, is to balance them with good influence.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.060]   That seems to be the approach.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.420]   And so it assumes that the best or the only way
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.420]   to counteract the hours which we spend
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.680]   being entertained by the world
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.360]   and being taught to love the world
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.800]   is to spend a corresponding quantity of time
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.560]   being entertained or taught by God or God's people
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.760]   so as to balance out the evil influences.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.280]   And the underlying assumption to that assumption
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   seems to be that either it's okay or inevitable
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.800]   that our kids or ourselves will in fact
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.600]   entertain ourselves with secularist TV programs
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.240]   or unedified TV programs.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.080]   I don't think either of those is the case.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.080]   I don't think it's inevitable and I don't think it's okay.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.720]   First of all, I don't think it's okay
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.120]   to entertain ourselves with what we would judge
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.560]   to be unedifying TV programs.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.920]   Paul taught that we ought to do only those things
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.160]   which build up rather than tear down.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.780]   And I have the feeling that many people in the church
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.540]   don't assess right and wrong on that continuum.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.760]   They ask, "Oh, there's nothing wrong here.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.560]   They're not doing anything wrong."
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.080]   When really what they ought to be saying is,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.840]   is it edifying, building me up,
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.600]   making me a better Christian, a better person?
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.680]   Because Paul seemed to think that that's what the goal
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.900]   or the aim of all of life should be,
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.640]   not just finding those things that we can judge
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.920]   to be not very harmful.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.360]   I would say that it's true that most TV programs
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.480]   are not edified.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.760]   The few that I see when I see them don't seem to me
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.560]   to be the kind that would leave me
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.580]   at the end of the program rejoicing more in God,
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.960]   being more inclined to obey Him,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.920]   feeling stronger affection for Christ,
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.480]   more zealous to do good.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.320]   They just don't.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.520]   Now, the second reason why I think it's wrong
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.960]   just to assess Sunday school quantitatively
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.360]   and say, "Well, one hour, what's one hour of Sunday school
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.560]   against 20 hours of TV or school or whatever?"
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.600]   The second reason that's a problem
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   and we ought not to use it is because it either overlooks
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.400]   or obscures the value of a holy moment.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.840]   And what I have in mind here
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.240]   is tremendously encouraging for teachers,
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.240]   but all those involved in any kind of counsel or advice
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.080]   or ministry of any sort,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.760]   I think it includes all of us.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.240]   This holy moment is what I would call
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.800]   the immeasurable moment.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.440]   What the quantitative approach overlooks or obscures
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   is the lasting transforming power of an insight,
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.160]   an insight that can come in a moment
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.320]   and change a life forever.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.120]   That's what I mean by the immeasurable moment.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.120]   The impact of a given moment because of a word spoken
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.560]   can be all out of proportion
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.080]   to the amount of time it takes to do it.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.800]   What I've learned from about 20 years of serious reading,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.520]   I say 20, it hasn't been quite 20,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.200]   that takes me back to 15 years old.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.240]   I didn't start to read until I was about 17.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.080]   I hated to read until I was in a junior high school.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.880]   So I started reading seriously though.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.400]   I got real serious about reading
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.840]   and I've been serious about reading ever since.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.760]   So there's been about 20 years I've been reading.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.000]   And what I have learned is this,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   it is sentences that change your life, not books.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.280]   I don't know if that's been your experience,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.960]   but I think for the most part, that's the case.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   What changes a life is a new glimpse into reality
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   or truth or some powerful challenge that comes to us
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.200]   or some resolution of a long standing dilemma
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.520]   that we've had.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.400]   And most of those, the insight, the challenge
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.000]   or the resolution are usually embodied
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.760]   in a very short little space, a paragraph or a sentence
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   and wham, it hits home.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.200]   And we remember it and it affects us
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.920]   for our whole life long.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.480]   I do not remember 99% of what I read.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.080]   That may just be me because I have a lousy memory.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.720]   I think it's pretty typical.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.320]   I don't remember 99% of what I read.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   But if the 1% is life changing insight into reality,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.440]   I won't begrudge the 99%.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.280]   I'll suffer that and accept it as my own frailty.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.240]   Usually for me, life changing insight,
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.480]   and I have been changed by reading,
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.400]   comes in a moment, in a paragraph, in a sentence,
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.240]   not in a book.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.320]   I don't remember books whole.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   Now here's some examples of immeasurable moments
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.240]   in my life from reading.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.440]   You know who I'm going to start with first?
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.560]   Jonathan Edwards wrote 70, or is it 73 resolutions
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.000]   when he was in college, lifetime resolutions.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.280]   And I have never forgotten number six,
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   resolved to live with all my might while I do live.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.560]   I've never forgotten.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.880]   That sentence has meant more to me
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.840]   than thousands of other sentences that I've ever read.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.480]   Live with all your might while you live.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   Don't just drift through life, limp through life, live.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.680]   Number two, in his religious affection,
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.720]   he said, "True religion is in great measure,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:12.840]   consists in great measure in holy affections."
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.000]   I had never read a book, it's about 400 pages or so,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.160]   and I don't remember most of what's in it,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   but I'd never read a book that showed that true religion
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.680]   consists very much in holy affections.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.680]   Now that's just his 18th century word for emotions.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.000]   I had been brought up to think, fact, faith, feeling,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.760]   fact, faith, feeling, fact, faith, feeling.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   Keep it in that order.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.880]   And the feeling drops off the end,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.440]   it's just a caboose, you won't miss anything anyway.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.280]   That isn't true.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.560]   The New Testament shot through with demands
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.680]   that are so radical that they do demand joy,
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.920]   peace, hope, gratitude.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   I hesitate to mention love because you'd all come up
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.040]   and say, "Love's not a feeling, love's not a feeling."
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   But if you read 1 Corinthians 13 and how it's defined,
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.720]   you can get away from the fact that love
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.200]   is not only a feeling, but is at least partly a feeling.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.440]   For example, love is not jealous.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.280]   Jealousy is a feeling.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.160]   And if you love, you don't have that feeling.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.040]   So that was another staggering sentence,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.960]   an immeasurable moment to hear Jonathan Edwards
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.160]   say and defend true religion in great part
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.880]   consists in holy affections.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.360]   St. Paul, now of course the Bible
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.960]   is just full of such sentences,
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.720]   but I'll just mention one because it might tip you off
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.960]   and help you understand me and a lot of my preaching.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.040]   I wonder what sentence you think I would pick out
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.840]   of St. Paul as the immeasurable moment
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   that stands out above all others from 1968 to the present.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.720]   It's Philippians 2.12 and 13.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.840]   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.960]   for it is God who is at work in you
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.120]   to will and to do His good pleasure.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.280]   That sentence hit me my freshman year in seminary
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.320]   like a load of bricks because all of Paul's theology
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.360]   is in it just about.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.600]   That intermingling of the sovereign work of God
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.280]   in our lives with our effort.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.480]   You work for He is working to will and to do.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.200]   Next person, C.S. Lewis.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   This sentence, the first page of his weight of glory.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.840]   If we consider the unblessing promises of reward
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.800]   and the staggering nature of the rewards
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.080]   promised in the gospels, it would seem that our Lord
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.440]   finds our desires not too strong but too weak.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.200]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.440]   and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.040]   like an ignorant child who wants to go on
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.360]   making mud pies in the slum because he cannot imagine
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.120]   what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.520]   We are far too easily pleased.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.080]   That sentence along with several others converted me
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.360]   into being what I've called a Christian hedonist.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.240]   Namely, that what Jesus wants from us is not the cessation
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.400]   of the desire to be happy but the heightening
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.600]   of the desire to be happy until it's so intense
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.040]   we won't be satisfied with anything but God
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.680]   as the fulfillment of our joy.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.480]   Then finally on reading St. Augustine,
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.000]   two sentences from the confessions.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.440]   I first read the confessions of Augustine
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.560]   as a sophomore in college, I think.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.240]   It was in Western world literature.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.640]   I can't remember when I took that course
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.440]   but my first or second year in college
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   and two sentences have shaped me very greatly.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.720]   One, I have no hope at all but in the great mercy,
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   in thy great mercy, grant what thou commandest
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.680]   and command what thou will.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.400]   Grant what thou commandest and command what thou will.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.840]   It's really the same as Philippians 2, 12 and 13
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.760]   but stated very, very powerfully.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.120]   The impact it had was to show me
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.040]   that the book I was reading at the time,
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.640]   Joseph Fletcher's Situation Ethics was wrong
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.000]   because Fletcher argued love cannot involve feelings
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.040]   because it's commanded.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.080]   You can't command emotions, therefore love must be in action
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.800]   and therefore it doesn't involve any feelings.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.680]   That's not right.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.400]   There's a theological mistake in Fletcher's argument,
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.120]   namely the assumption that God can't command
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   what we can't give without his help.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.240]   But he can command what we can't give without his help
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.840]   because he can give the help.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.200]   And Augustine says, grant what thou commandest
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.240]   and command what thou will.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.960]   The context in the confessions was sexual continency.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.360]   Augustine was a raunchy man.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.200]   He was very polluted sexually before he became a Christian.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.320]   And after he became a Christian,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.560]   his problem with sexual temptation did not end.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.600]   And he was talking about sexual continency,
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.720]   containing himself and not being illicit
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.040]   in his sexual relations.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.240]   And he said, I cannot do it.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   Grant what thou commandest, then command what thou will.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.800]   And then the other sentence that he said,
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.840]   I didn't see this one until, I can't remember when it was,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.480]   but I have always struggled with the problem
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.480]   of how to love a sunset, a wife, a child,
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   chocolate ice cream, popcorn, et cetera,
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.160]   and not have that compete with my allegiance to God.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.640]   I don't know if you've ever struggled with that.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.800]   How can you stand before a beautiful painting or a sunset
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.400]   and say, that is beautiful, I love it,
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.920]   and not have God look down and say,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.960]   hey, you're supposed to love me, not that.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.840]   And here's what Augustine said.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   For he loves thee too little
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.080]   who loves anything together with thee,
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.360]   which he loves not for thy sake.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.800]   That was an immeasurable moment when I read that sentence.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.080]   He loves thee too little
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.520]   who loves anything together with thee
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.960]   that he loves not for thy sake.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.520]   That bears a lot of pondering, doesn't it?
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.520]   We can love people, things, sunsets, food,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.600]   for Jesus' sake.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.880]   That's the end of my list.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.760]   It could go on and on and on.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.760]   The point is, life-changing moments come in sentences
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.880]   and paragraphs, not in long, long remembrances of old books.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.480]   Lights go on, our hearts are strangely warm,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.400]   and experience comes of an immeasurable moment,
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.880]   and we are changed decisively.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.600]   - Amazing, I love the testimony of life-changing sentences.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.160]   The immeasurable moment, the immeasurable moment.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.640]   I just shared most of the whole recording,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.600]   but if you wanna hear the whole thing,
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.960]   you can find it now online for the first time
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.880]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.200]   Piper delivered it to his Sunday school teachers
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.040]   on July 13th, 1981, in a message titled
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.560]   Quantitative Hopelessness and the Immeasurable Moment.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.160]   And a big shout out to John Osborne and Nathan Olson,
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.880]   two DG staff members who find
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.160]   and get these lost recordings online for us.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.240]   Well done to you, John and Nathan.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.440]   Thank you for your work.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.000]   Friday, we return to address another mature theme,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.920]   particularly the topic of sexual sin.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.480]   It's a heavy episode.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.680]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.600]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.880]   Then we'll see you Friday.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:20.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
