[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.200]   - Would you like to get the back office scoop
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.100]   from an experienced veteran of the life insurance industry
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.100]   to understand how companies actually
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.840]   approach the underwriting of individual policies?
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.640]   Today I'm going to share with you an interview
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.220]   with a friend of mine, a man named Todd Simpson, who
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.360]   is a 30-plus year veteran of the life insurance industry
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.920]   and specializes in high risk, or what we call special risk,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.200]   underwriting for life insurance.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.100]   I think you'll enjoy this behind the scenes view
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.340]   of the industry.
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:18.380]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.480]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.360]   This is episode 204 of the show.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.220]   I'm going to be with a friend of mine, Todd Simpson.
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.460]   Todd is one of the partners in a company called the Stam Agency.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.560]   He is an insurance broker.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.460]   Doesn't work directly with individual clients,
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.060]   but rather works as a broker working with life insurance
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.100]   agents.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.680]   Took some microphones into his office,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.140]   pinned him down, and asked him all the hard questions
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.780]   that I think you would want to ask him
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.380]   if you had the opportunity.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.740]   I've mentioned Todd a couple of times on the show,
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.720]   not by name, but in referencing a friend of mine who
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.520]   was a high risk or a special risk broker.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.940]   And this was somebody that I worked
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.180]   with when I was an active life insurance agent to help
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.140]   me place a lot of my cases.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.480]   Todd's a great guy, has a long history in the life insurance
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.920]   business, and I think you'll enjoy some of the behind
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.240]   the scenes access.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.640]   Doing my best to change the tenor
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.200]   and the tone of financial media.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.720]   So oftentimes, the people that are referenced
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.240]   on financial media, the people that want to be out there,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.360]   and the people that are out there with a message,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.680]   with something to sell.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.980]   And I'm trying to go to the people that aren't out there
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.480]   asking for things and try to talk about how things really
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.280]   happen, to try to expose the reality of things to you.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.520]   And that was what happened.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.880]   I called up Todd, and I said, hey, Todd,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.520]   I want to come and talk to you and bring you on the show.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   He wasn't necessarily looking for it.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.420]   He didn't really want to do it, but he agreed to do it.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.160]   And that was how he wound up on the show.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   But I think you'll find this insightful.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.460]   I'm trying to ask him the toughest questions that I can
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.940]   to try to create more of communication.
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.880]   Especially if you ever owned life insurance
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.520]   or ever want to own life insurance,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.760]   you'll find this to be useful.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.840]   And if you know anybody who's ever
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.560]   been declined for life insurance or who's
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.800]   been rated for life insurance, or if you find yourself
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.840]   in that situation, this is a useful resource for you.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.960]   Todd is an expert.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.200]   He's a CLU and a CHFC.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.740]   That means he's a chartered life underwriter and a chartered
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.600]   financial consultant.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.760]   He's been in the business for many, many years.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.520]   And he is an expert when it comes especially
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.240]   to the topic of insurance underwriting.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.440]   He is-- in the old days, they would call insurance agents
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.960]   field underwriters.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.200]   Now unfortunately, I think some of that professionalism
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.040]   has been lost in the life insurance business.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.220]   But in many ways, a life insurance agent
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.680]   is, in fact, an underwriter that's in the field.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.000]   They're the first line of actually figuring out
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.300]   what's an appropriate solution for this specific client,
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.120]   for this specific need.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.680]   Todd is kind of the next level.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.720]   He's a broker.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.200]   So his responsibility is to figure out
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.880]   where do I place this case.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.720]   And he's been, in my years as a financial--
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.280]   as an insurance agent, he was a very useful resource to me.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.240]   Knowing what company to place a case with
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.680]   and knowing how to structure a case
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.720]   can make a major, major difference.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.400]   And I think you'll hear that in this interview with Todd.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.680]   There is a level of professional expertise
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.880]   that goes a long way in the life insurance business.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.640]   That's it for me.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.140]   Here we go.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.680]   So Todd, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.660]   I appreciate your being with me today.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.820]   I appreciate you having me.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.500]   Thank you.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.140]   I bragged about you on the show before.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.620]   I've talked about my special risk broker
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.820]   who was able to help me place all these high risk cases.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.260]   And now we get you here live and in person
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.620]   to school us on what to do with some special risk life
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.320]   insurance cases.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.760]   But I'd like to start with just hearing
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.980]   a little bit about your background in the life
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.860]   insurance business.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.340]   How did you wind up in the life insurance business?
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.860]   Well, I really had no direction in what I wanted
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.140]   to be doing back in 1983.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.580]   And I was at a social event and introduced
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.380]   to the then owner of the agency that I'm still currently with.
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.380]   And he and I had some nice conversation.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.820]   And he asked me what I thought I was going to be doing.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.180]   How old were you at the time?
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.140]   I was 19.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.620]   And he and I had some nice conversation.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620]   And then over the next few months,
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.300]   we continued to have some conversations.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.260]   And he offered me a job.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.020]   He said, why don't you come into the office
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.620]   and see what you think, try it out.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.940]   And he gave me a basic breakdown of what they did,
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.060]   which I had no understanding of whatsoever.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.300]   And the rest is history.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.300]   So no experience, just fresh off the street.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.140]   And you built your business cold calling on people
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.020]   or working with agents?
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.140]   Or what was the initial--
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.220]   what did your business look like in the beginning?
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.300]   I wish it was that pretty.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.820]   It actually ended up being coming into the office
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.380]   and learning a little bit about the business,
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.380]   very basic things.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.580]   They threw books at me to read, anything
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.300]   they could get their hands on.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.460]   And his offer to me was, you basically
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.540]   have to work through every job in the office
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.220]   before we can really teach you anything substantial.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.300]   So I had that moment where I was like, oh, man,
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.780]   am I getting duped?
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.940]   Or is this really going to be something for a career?
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.580]   And that was his guidance to me, was if you want a career,
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.500]   you've got to learn everything that we do.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.140]   So I literally started answering phones for the agency
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.500]   to start with and worked my way through every job.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.620]   And back in those days, we had 20 employees.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.420]   So there were a lot of jobs to work through,
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.760]   a lot of different things we were
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.940]   able to do that have changed.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.740]   And the interesting thing is, some of the things
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.900]   we were doing back then, you wouldn't think of doing now.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.420]   Like what?
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.980]   We financed premiums.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.100]   OK.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.300]   Which was totally legal at the time, everyone.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.300]   A little different now.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.180]   Totally legal.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.180]   But we would actually, because the companies didn't
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.780]   annualize commissions, we would pay the annual premiums
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.740]   on the policies.
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.980]   And the clients would sign a promissory note with us.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.100]   And we would actually go about collecting premiums.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.000]   So would 1983 still have been the days of rate books
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.180]   and going through the tables and manually calculating things
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.080]   prior to illustrations and all of that?
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.160]   Exactly.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.580]   You say rate card to someone now,
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.460]   and they're like, what are you talking about?
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.780]   And that was really our only basis of quoting.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.220]   Probably about six months after I started
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.900]   with the agency in 1984--
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.500]   1984 was my actual start date with the agency.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.660]   And we got our first IBM PC with the floppy disks.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.340]   And I think I was the first one in the office
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.180]   to actually run an illustration on the new IBM personal
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.820]   computer.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.420]   So it was an interesting time.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.220]   But it was right at the time that Universal Life actually
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.420]   came on the scene.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.380]   At the time, we were quoting term and whole life.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.820]   And those were the only two products that were even
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.380]   available at that time.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.700]   The managing director who recruited me into the business
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.220]   would tell me stories of sitting there and filling in custom
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.580]   kind of graphs with colored pencils and illustrations
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.980]   and kind of printing them up.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.580]   And you had your standard 100,000 of 90 life
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.780]   and 100,000 of ordinary life and 100,000 of term.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.380]   And that was what you had to work with.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.660]   Exactly.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.860]   So here's the question.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.940]   Fast forward to today, and you produce all the time
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.060]   customized illustrations with details.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.940]   Do you think the business has--
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.300]   are clients better served by the way it is now,
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.100]   or were they better served back then?
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.820]   That's an interesting question.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.540]   Because I think we did a lot of things really well back then.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.580]   And I think there was a little more client-agent-broker
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.260]   interaction.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.780]   Because people weren't looking for everything today.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.280]   They knew it was going to take time.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.500]   So you had more conversations with your clients.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.060]   You had probably a little more personal contact.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.820]   Now, everybody's looking for everything quick.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.700]   And sometimes it makes me wonder,
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.820]   not being out in the field, how much interaction
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.220]   the agents are actually having with their clients.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.380]   Is it a quick sale where the client's like, hey, listen,
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.460]   I'm giving you half an hour.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.300]   You better get in here and give me everything
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.380]   and explain it and get it to me right now?
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.460]   Or is there a buildup to that?
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.260]   Is there a lot of interaction?
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.940]   So I think it's different the way people do it now.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.900]   But I think the ease of getting information
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.820]   is better now, obviously.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.460]   Without the internet, back then you
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.700]   had to call God knows how many people at home office
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.380]   to get an answer.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.540]   Or I remember during my studies for CLU,
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.180]   you had to find a mentor.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.020]   And you were hoping that they knew the answer to the question
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.540]   because you couldn't just Google it.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.980]   And you'd be like, all right, I need
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.180]   to know what this term means or that term means.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.300]   And so it's interesting now.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.060]   So my audience generally in today's world,
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.140]   many people have very strong feelings on life insurance.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.460]   What you should do, what you shouldn't do,
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.860]   what's the right type of policies.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.980]   People have a lot of strong feelings,
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.900]   especially in the personal finance space, which
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.500]   is where I spend my time.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.740]   Is that different in 2015 than it was in 1985?
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.820]   Or were people very opinionated, just the general public
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.820]   back then as well?
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.220]   The interesting thing to me back then
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.300]   was I can remember whole life was sold because term
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.220]   was almost just as expensive.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:34.780]   Really?
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.020]   Yeah, there were no level-- you had basically
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.660]   YRT, which is a one-year term.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.580]   The earlier renewable term, YRT.
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.900]   And 10-year term might have been the two options you had.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.780]   And the YRT would literally become just as expensive
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.100]   as a whole life in about three years.
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.820]   So it was easier to sell whole life from the get-go
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.780]   and just tell folks, hey, this is what you need.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.380]   You should have this cash value build up.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.220]   And as the different level terms came up,
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.060]   that changed a little bit and skewed it a little bit.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.940]   And then universal life, of course, when that came,
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.940]   people were illustrating 13%, 14%, 15% returns
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.060]   when it first came out.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.260]   And that changed the scope because you
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.940]   could get a term-like premium with a return on your money,
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.380]   which really kind of blew up.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.300]   And it was a good thing for a little while.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.900]   Obviously, the rates didn't hold up.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.260]   And you won't see any of those policies around anymore,
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.140]   I'm sure.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.020]   Was the term-- so describe the term "life debacle"
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.300]   as far as the idea of vanishing premiums,
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.660]   the way they were illustrated.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.660]   Describe what happened from your perspective
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.180]   as a broker and agent.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.500]   As far as term insurance goes?
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.980]   No, universal life insurance.
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.060]   Oh, the universal life.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.340]   It was just crazy to think that you
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.820]   could get that kind of return.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.020]   But no one saw it at the time.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.420]   Insurance companies had come from a place of safety.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.180]   Again, they were showing term.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.720]   You had these premiums right in front of you that were term.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.060]   And then you had these premiums for whole life.
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.180]   And they were pretty much guaranteed.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.020]   They said, as long as you pay these premiums.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.440]   And then universal life came in and said, hey, guess what?
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.860]   You can become flexible with your premium.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.420]   We can save you money by interest rate.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.380]   And that was something that people had never seen before.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.180]   And you could get a term-like premium
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.340]   and actually have a return on it.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.580]   People jumped all over it, especially at 13% or 14%.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.100]   You were looking at some seriously decreasing premiums.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.300]   And with that, term insurance then got cheaper.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.780]   And then the different level periods of term came in.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.100]   Why did term insurance get cheaper?
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.520]   To be able to compete effectively?
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.380]   Or what was the market press on it?
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.380]   Well, at the time, universal life, when it came out,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.660]   could actually have been cheaper than 10, 15, or 20-year term
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.740]   with a return on it.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.460]   So all of a sudden, the company started thinking,
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.460]   well, we're obviously not going to sell any term
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.060]   if we're doing this.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.660]   And that's when the term started--
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.060]   the term wars, in a sense, that they talk about now
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.060]   that are going on, and they are currently going on,
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.860]   started really way back then when universal life hit.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.860]   Because the premiums, they had to find a way
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.380]   to make those products more affordable.
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.220]   So that would have been late '80s, early '90s?
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.300]   Yes.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.700]   Since then, in your guess, how much have rates decreased
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.020]   on term insurance, for example?
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.820]   It would be hard for me to say, but I
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.300]   would say they're probably 75% cheaper than they
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.700]   were back in the day.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.900]   And do you think that's primarily the market forces,
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.820]   the competition?
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.320]   How much of that is associated with the changes in mortality
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.820]   tables?
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.180]   What do you think?
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.020]   I think it's got some to do with mortality tables,
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.340]   but mostly just pricing.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.940]   Companies came down to, we've got to do this in order
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.340]   to sell any of this.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.180]   It's interesting to me, because back in the '80s,
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.580]   if you got a million dollar death benefit,
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.460]   that was a big deal.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.220]   You were a big shot.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.020]   Yeah, you were.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.220]   That was a great case.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.460]   Companies would actually fly down and bring you the policy.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.540]   And that's on a term case.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.020]   That could be a 10-year term case.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.340]   So a million dollar policy on a 50-year-old,
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.800]   and they're like, oh my gosh, we're
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.620]   going to come down and we're going to actually fly down
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.700]   and bring you the policy.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.820]   We'll go with you to go deliver that policy.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.260]   Now you get a million dollar policy on a 50-year-old
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.820]   and it barely keeps the lights on.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.700]   It's just not that profitable anymore.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.820]   So how did you wind up in your current specialty
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.780]   of special risk broker?
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.260]   The agency was created because the founder
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:51.980]   saw a need that wasn't being looked at by people's companies.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:57.580]   And I can't even really remember the names of the companies.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.460]   Consumers Life comes to mind, Transport Life.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.700]   Fidelity Bankers Life was another company.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.660]   These were companies that were A-rated companies with best.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.820]   And this was back before S&P got into heavily rating companies.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.500]   And he got a group of these companies together and said,
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.180]   hey, I want to start an agency where the agents can come
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.500]   when their company won't do a case.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.980]   And let's help them do it.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.100]   And how can we do that?
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.580]   And these companies basically established
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.500]   more creative guidelines for underwriting
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.180]   and started looking more at the people
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.900]   as individuals versus a group.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.500]   Because we all know how insurance pricing works.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.780]   It's basically set on groups of people.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.260]   And you're in this group, and that's
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.300]   how you pay your premium.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.580]   So that's how they were underwriting it.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.300]   Because all that pricing was basically set up on--
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.780]   and again, at that time, they didn't
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.180]   have preferred and preferred best.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.620]   It was more like standard was the best rate.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.340]   And so everything was based on standard.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.580]   And they just couldn't get over--
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.100]   we can't look outside this box of pricing.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.220]   And we got these other companies to basically look
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.420]   outside the box of pricing and look at people's
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:09.260]   individuals.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.100]   And that's kind of how it got started.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.380]   So you had the idea of working and serving
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.940]   the agents who were captive or semi-captive
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.060]   to their companies, but who, when they had a case
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.260]   that their company wouldn't take based on underwriting
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.380]   guidelines, to go ahead and be the broker for them
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.620]   to help them place that case.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.900]   Exactly.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.100]   Interesting.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.460]   What are the most common medical conditions
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.580]   that wind up on your desk?
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.580]   We see a ton of diabetes, obviously coronary artery
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.540]   disease is another one, cancers.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.260]   Those would be the three primaries.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.340]   There's obviously anything that could technically
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.580]   be wrong with someone could come across my desk.
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.380]   But on a daily basis, I'm dealing with those probably
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.700]   80% of the time.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.460]   So let's start with diabetes.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.860]   Someone's listening.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.500]   They say, I've got diabetes.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.980]   I need some life insurance.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.540]   They haven't gone through the state.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.260]   They don't have a broker, an agent that's
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.580]   working with them yet.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.980]   What does somebody with diabetes need
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.940]   to know to be able to A, even place the case,
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.860]   and B, improve their rates if they go out and are
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.420]   trying to get a policy?
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.380]   Well, it really comes down to how that individual's diabetes
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.420]   is controlled.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:34.780]   There's obviously still uninsurable type scenarios,
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.940]   but there is as good as standard scenarios
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.180]   when it comes to diabetes.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:45.140]   You basically need to know date of onset, how it's controlled,
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.540]   is there family history, are they doing the right things,
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.700]   are they going to their doctor on a regular basis,
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.500]   are there readings within a parameter,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.820]   different things like that.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.060]   So somebody's been declined in the past, and they say,
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.140]   I want to get life insurance.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.780]   The steps that they need to be taking is, number one,
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.620]   consistently visiting with their doctor,
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.180]   doing what their doctor says, and getting their A1C levels
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.820]   to an acceptable range.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.660]   And what would be the range, in your guess,
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.140]   for someone with diabetes who's doing their A1C readings?
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.660]   Anything up to A is writable.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.220]   It's going to be rated.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.180]   The companies would rather see less than seven.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.780]   And less than seven is actually pretty good control
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.580]   for a diabetic.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.900]   But up to eight is writable.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.620]   Sometimes over eight is writable.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.420]   Again, it just kind of depends on the different things
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.900]   that you're looking at.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.540]   But the primary thing that the companies
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.260]   are looking for these days is someone
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.620]   who actually listens to their doctor
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.100]   and goes to the doctor on a regular basis
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.340]   and is checking the things that they need to.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.220]   The number one issue that hurts us
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.660]   is people who think they know more than their doctor.
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.620]   And that happens a lot now because of the internet.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.020]   We talked before about how things were back then
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.300]   versus now.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.380]   And let's face it, information is a dime a dozen
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.460]   on the internet.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.860]   You could Google diabetes and read for days.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.580]   And some people do that.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.340]   And then they think they know more than their doctor,
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.460]   and it's really not the case.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.460]   - Heart disease.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.460]   What are the types of heart disease
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.300]   that can just skate in without any ratings?
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.900]   What are the types that are mildly rated?
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.540]   Where do you get into severe and decline?
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.260]   - The interesting thing about heart disease
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.220]   is there's so many different things attached to it.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.020]   And obviously, believe it or not,
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.060]   the easiest one to underwrite is a heart attack.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:42.900]   - Why?
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.780]   - Because you know it happened.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.620]   - Right, okay.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.580]   - It's a very findable issue,
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.460]   and it's a very treatable issue.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.660]   Either by catheterization, bypass surgery, stenting,
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.440]   whatever the source may be that's needed to handle that.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.560]   But it's actually kind of a cut and dry illness.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.940]   And with the advances in medicine,
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.180]   the doctors can see in your arteries,
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.820]   they can see how your valves are working,
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.540]   they can see all that kind of stuff going on.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.080]   So it is very treatable.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.100]   And again, if you follow what your doctors say
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.420]   and you follow a diet, you do some exercise,
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.820]   and you're not a couch potato,
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.880]   then that definitely works out.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.780]   The harder things to write are carotid artery issues.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.220]   And that's actually where most plaque begins,
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:38.140]   because then you're kind of going from CAD to stroke,
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.120]   possibilities, those things become hard to underwrite.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.300]   Tachycardias and arrhythmias,
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.900]   which are just basically different abnormal heartbeats,
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.100]   those are very difficult,
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.100]   because those are electrical responses
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.620]   that have to then do with your brain
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.320]   and the cycle of your body.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.300]   So those become a little harder to underwrite.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.580]   Valve disease is also coronary artery disease,
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.260]   and it just depends on how your valves are functioning.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.420]   If you've had a valve replacement, that's actually good,
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.900]   depending on the valve replacement when it was done,
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.820]   because most valve replacements have to be redone.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.700]   So if you have a 10-year shelf life,
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.340]   come and get your insurance two years
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.820]   after you have the valve done,
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.100]   and keep it in force, because closer to 10 years,
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.420]   we may be looking at, well, you know what,
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.220]   he could be having issues with that valve now,
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.580]   and there might be, you know,
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.060]   it doesn't mean that it has to be replaced after 10 years,
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.020]   but there's more of a likelihood it's having an issue again.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.780]   - I know rules of thumb are dangerous,
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.740]   but if someone's had a condition,
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.700]   should they wait a certain amount of time?
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.620]   Should they wait a year
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.780]   and then go start investigating insurance?
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.700]   Or should they investigate right away?
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.860]   Should they wait two years?
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.460]   What advice would you give in general?
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.540]   - I'm glad you asked me that,
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.060]   because we get a lot of calls from guys who do wait,
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.220]   and my advice is to call me right away.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.100]   And the reason for that is,
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.700]   depending on severity of the issue,
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.820]   let's say a heart attack, for instance,
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.100]   if you had a heart attack,
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.100]   and it was just because you had one artery
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.460]   that was a little bit clogged,
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.580]   and they were able to go in and sten it,
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.660]   we could look at you after three months,
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.220]   possibly very favorably.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.420]   So waiting on that could actually be a negative,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.420]   because if you're disease is kind of growing,
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.460]   and you waited two or three years,
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.620]   you could end up with three or four arteries
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.500]   that are started now occluding.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.500]   So you get to a point where there's,
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.740]   obviously the opportune time to get covered
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.380]   is before you have any issues.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.420]   At a young age, you get your coverage,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.300]   you can keep it in force,
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.500]   but if you're not able to do that,
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.380]   or you didn't know what you needed,
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.620]   then waiting can sometimes be a hindrance.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.900]   Now, it may be that you call me and say,
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.860]   "Hey, listen, my buddy had triple bypass yesterday,
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.540]   and I'm gonna tell you,
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.220]   we'll come back in six months to a year."
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.700]   But at least we have that conversation.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.300]   - Explain how the insurance companies handle information,
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.460]   and answer if it's a good idea
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.700]   to go ahead and make some formal inquiries
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.940]   or formal application early,
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.660]   'cause then you're on the record,
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.740]   and you're on the record,
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.620]   well, explain, just to split them apart,
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.980]   number one, explain how the insurance companies
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.780]   share information among themselves.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.140]   - Well, the number one way is through MIB,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.620]   which is the Medical Information Bureau.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.620]   And back in the early days, that used to be sporadic,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.100]   because it was up to individuals
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.020]   to physically write out a report and mail it to MIB.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.460]   Now, we're talking prior to fax machines, email, et cetera.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.060]   Now, it's all electronic,
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.900]   so the underwriter does it as they're underwriting the case.
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.780]   So the chances of a missed MIB hit are scarce.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.940]   Your information is gonna be uploaded to MIB.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.060]   - So when you make an application to an insurance company,
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.140]   they're going to upload your information
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.460]   to the Medical Information Bureau,
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.660]   and it's fully accessible then
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.260]   to any other insurance company who subscribes to the MIB,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.180]   which is all of them, right?
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.660]   - Exactly.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.840]   And they basically just code for details.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.100]   They don't give a lot of detail.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.060]   What they're gonna do is they're gonna code MIB
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.340]   that an application's been submitted,
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.420]   and then if they find you have diabetes,
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.280]   they'll code you for diabetes.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.500]   They don't tell what they've done with it.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.380]   So another company can't really get the information
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.260]   that, oh, company A offered me a rating.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.100]   They're not gonna get that information.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.620]   They're just gonna get that they were looked at
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.900]   for a certain impairment.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:58.300]   And what we do find on MIB
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.240]   is the companies do code everything.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.540]   I probably have more cases that get declined
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.600]   because the client wasn't upfront with us
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.260]   about an issue they had that is coded on MIB.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.220]   And that can be anywhere from alcoholism
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.700]   to a bad driving record to past drug use
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.620]   to a medical impairment.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.700]   Those are the kind of things
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.260]   that we get stung with quite a bit.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.040]   - So the client thinks, 'cause most people,
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.180]   it's written on every insurance application.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.460]   I hereby authorize Insurance Company X
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.700]   to disclose my information
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.200]   to the Medical Information Bureau.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.040]   No one reads it.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.260]   No one has a clue that they're signing it.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.460]   So many people, I think, have this idea
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.020]   that they're going to,
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.100]   well, I'm just not gonna tell 'em
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.860]   and they're not gonna see it.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.180]   And the answer to that is
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.660]   if you've made any application ever
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.020]   which codes certain information,
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.620]   yeah, I had a DUI, boom, that's in there.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.540]   And if you don't disclose it,
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.780]   you're doing yourself a major,
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.300]   you're causing a major problem.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.860]   - Exactly.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.380]   You could be a prime candidate for insurance
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.580]   and get declined for a misstatement
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.740]   or a misrepresentation
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.900]   or just flat out not saying something on application.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.860]   - So then you get into, okay, what do I do?
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.420]   'Cause if I know that system
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.740]   and I'm looking at myself and I'm saying,
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.260]   "All right, I probably should get some insurance,
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.940]   "but I've got this issue."
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.780]   (laughs)
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.900]   I don't wanna, I know that I can't misrepresent something
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.860]   to use legal language.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.140]   I can't lie.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.380]   So I'm just gonna choose not to deal with my issue.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.180]   Is that the right course of action?
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.740]   Or how do you work through that?
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.340]   - The easiest way for us to help with that,
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.300]   that I see and that I tell our agents is
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.660]   we can talk to,
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.940]   well, we can't talk to the client personally,
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.340]   just there's legal issues about that.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.060]   But I can have a conversation with an agent
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.900]   without a client's name,
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.940]   with their age instead of date of birth
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.740]   and with the primary things going on with that individual.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.860]   And I can use, number one, my knowledge,
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.800]   and number two, going to company underwriters anonymously.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.420]   That is the one nice thing about what we do
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.520]   is we can at least get a preliminary look.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.420]   And with that, obviously, it's not gonna be any guarantee
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.540]   that you're going to get insured,
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.100]   but you can go back to the client with,
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.200]   "Hey, we went to the companies
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.620]   "and if what you're telling me
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.680]   "is really all the information,
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.140]   "we're looking at this premium.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.180]   "And if you feel you can afford that premium,
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.020]   "then there's no reason we shouldn't go ahead and apply."
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.780]   'Cause again, unless something comes out of left field,
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:48.060]   you've got a good chance of getting this.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.620]   And that's one of the services we offer our guys.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.900]   We don't need all of the information up front.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.660]   We don't need any distinguishing information
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.700]   for that client specifically
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.060]   to kind of give them an idea of what we can do.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.140]   - Back to cancer.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.900]   Most of the time you hear the cancer diagnosis,
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.860]   "I'm doomed, I'm never getting life insurance again."
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.900]   Is that true? (laughs)
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.500]   - No, it's not.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.980]   I would say on average,
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.360]   cancer is the toughest thing to underwrite.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.660]   It's because there's so many different things
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.740]   that can happen with it.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.640]   But it really, again, comes down to the individual,
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.820]   comes down to what kind of cancer,
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.660]   where the cancer is located,
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.140]   what kind of treatment,
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.220]   whether there was metastasis of the cancer,
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.760]   all of those different things.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.340]   Minor skin cancers are no big deal.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.540]   You can underwrite right away.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:51.540]   More invasive skin cancers are postpones, flat extras.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:58.100]   And then you get into the different kinds of cancers,
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.600]   organ cancers and whatever else, brain cancers,
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.560]   those kinds of things.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.520]   And it just, again, depends on what has been happening.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.440]   Obviously early detection,
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.720]   which everyone wants anyway for longevity,
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.720]   is a key to underwriting also.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.040]   If you get to it early and you get the treatments,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.160]   and obviously there's no cure, as they say,
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.320]   but there is being in remission.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.200]   And remission is good enough for the companies.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.260]   And that's what they're looking for.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.860]   - So what you're saying is listen to Joshua
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.620]   and get your life insurance now while you don't need it.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.880]   (laughing)
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.340]   - The interesting thing too is what I think we should say
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.180]   in addition to that is obviously the younger you are,
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.340]   figure out your need and at least get some coverage.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.660]   I mean, obviously when you're younger,
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.060]   you can't afford as much coverage
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.140]   as you'll hopefully be able to afford later on in life,
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.380]   but get something in place.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.540]   Worst case that I've seen is people
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.360]   who just don't get any insurance,
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.760]   they're 55 and they get diagnosed with cancer
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.880]   and it's the type that we're just never gonna be able
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.720]   to underwrite it.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.920]   - Right.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.840]   - You get a situation like that
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.120]   and it actually makes me sad to think--
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:11.960]   - I hate it.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.300]   - That's something that I just can't help somebody with.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.200]   And you'd like to and there's just nothing you can do
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.040]   for that person.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.600]   So obviously buying young and healthy
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.360]   is the name of the game.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.880]   The issue in addition to that would be
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.960]   finding the right product because I can't tell you
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   how many times someone comes to me and says,
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   you know, I really only have a 10 year need
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.680]   for this coverage.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.440]   And then 10 years down the road,
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.540]   those are the people who are calling me and saying,
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:48.800]   well, you know, I really messed that up.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.300]   I need coverage for at least another 10 years.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.240]   So you're looking at higher rates because of age difference,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.960]   you're 10 years older.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.520]   And obviously as you get older,
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.280]   you have more possibility of getting some health things.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.960]   I mean, whether it's even cholesterol
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.040]   and high blood pressure and something of that matter,
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.520]   those things come into effect
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.860]   and they might not come into effect
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.840]   where you're actually a rated impaired risk case,
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.300]   but you're gonna go from best preferred now up to standard.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.680]   And you're 10 years older
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.840]   and you're looking to do this coverage again.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.520]   So really overthink how long you think you might need it.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.120]   - What's your trick for doing that?
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.200]   Is it just to go with a longer term?
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.480]   Do you try, if you were, you know,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.760]   if we were sitting down over drinks
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.320]   and you're giving me advice, young father,
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.960]   do you point me toward 30 year term,
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.720]   20 year term with renewability?
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.520]   Like how do you approach it personally?
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.680]   - I usually look at, you know, exactly.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.520]   Young father, your need is gonna be at least 30 years.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.280]   And again, that's without you and I
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.960]   having much of a conversation about it,
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.000]   but I can tell you flat out,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.020]   you're gonna need coverage for 30 years.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.000]   You think you're gonna wanna just have coverage
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.080]   to get your kids up through college,
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.480]   but then you think, oh, well, you know,
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.520]   by that time I'm gonna have one heck of a mortgage
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.440]   hanging over me and yeah,
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.880]   I might wanna like keep that coverage then for my wife
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.540]   who might get stuck with this mortgage
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.840]   or you know, whatever else might be going on.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.760]   And you know, then by that time,
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.440]   you know, maybe have grandkids,
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.960]   you know, those needs always continue.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.760]   You know, it's not something that really goes away.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.960]   A lot of people think it does,
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.880]   but the only thing that really goes away,
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.840]   I think in our business is the business side of insurance.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.560]   You know, I mean, obviously if you have
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.200]   a five year agreement with someone
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.380]   and at the end of that agreement,
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.800]   there's gonna be a buyout and you wanna ensure that buyout
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.040]   then that's an obvious, hey, five year need.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.840]   I see that.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.040]   But you know, when it's personal and it's family
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.240]   and you're trying to do the right thing by your loved ones,
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.840]   I'm not sure that need ever really totally goes away.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   - I had the experience and when I got in,
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.000]   excuse me, when I got into the insurance business,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.120]   I was a buy term, invest the difference
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.160]   until you're self-insured.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.680]   That was my philosophy.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.440]   So you're gonna be self-insured,
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.900]   you're not gonna want insurance.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.240]   So I remember kind of beating my head against the wall.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.080]   Here I was, 23 years old, talking to 50 year old people
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.160]   and basically telling them,
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.360]   well, you're not gonna want your insurance.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.860]   I'm like, are you kidding me?
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.040]   And what I've learned is that it seems that
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.360]   once you've had life insurance for a while,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.480]   not everybody, there are exceptions,
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.940]   but it seems my experience has been number one,
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.560]   most people don't self-insure
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.880]   because generally they increase their lifestyle
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.320]   and they wanna enjoy it.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.280]   You know, you've got your Harley and they update the,
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.000]   they move to the golf club and they go ahead
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.240]   and buy the fancy boat.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.960]   And yes, they're not being necessarily irresponsible,
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.320]   but they go ahead and upgrade
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.080]   and they got a little bit of a bigger mortgage
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.120]   and they're living a little higher lifestyle
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.760]   and they technically could be okay without the insurance,
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.000]   but technically okay doesn't feel as good as really okay.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.800]   Then the other thing is I think we just get used to it.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.960]   Like right now, I often,
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.320]   if I find myself in some dangerous situation
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.840]   or some close call, I just think,
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.740]   thankful that I have life insurance.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.920]   And that happens enough and you start to think,
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.560]   well, that's really nice to have that feeling.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.360]   And you start to appreciate it a lot more
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.880]   than I could conceive of when I was just kind of
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.240]   doing it based on theory alone.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.160]   - Right.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.280]   Well, and that is what happens a lot of times.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.240]   And for me on a personal level,
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.800]   my father passed away with very little insurance.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.440]   And unfortunately, because I was his son,
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.840]   he would never talk to me about his insurance need
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.500]   because in his eyes,
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.920]   he would always know more than I did about it.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.560]   And so I never pushed it.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.680]   And back when my parents were growing up,
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.200]   $100,000 was a lot of money.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.360]   So he had $100,000 worth of insurance,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.080]   but he died 20 years ago
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.680]   and all the kids were out of the house.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.760]   So he figured, you know what, I don't need to,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.560]   my wife doesn't need a bunch of coverage.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.020]   The kids are gone, they're on their own.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.120]   They're taking care of themselves.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.420]   Well, my mother had never worked.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:22.000]   And all of a sudden she was saddled with a mortgage
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.480]   and outstanding bills and just taxes,
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.320]   different things that you forget about on a daily basis
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.880]   that you write checks for.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.840]   And he had left her $100,000 policy
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.520]   with a $40,000 loan against it.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.840]   So she ended up with about 60,000 of net,
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.160]   out of the policy.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.960]   And to me that stings and that hits home,
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.840]   very close to home.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.120]   My mom had to go to work.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.320]   - Yeah, and she'd been out of the job force
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.600]   for 20 years, 30 years.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.440]   - Yeah, forever.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.400]   And it's those kinds of things that,
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.640]   like you referred to,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:58.000]   is there are people who believe in insurance
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.480]   and there's people who have insurance
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   because someone talked them into it.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.960]   So there's always gonna be that separation.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.080]   But you're right, people who believe in insurance
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.560]   understand what it's really used for
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.200]   and what good it can do for people.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.960]   Those are the people who you're gonna be able
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.440]   to have the good conversation with
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.360]   and they're gonna listen
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.540]   and you're gonna direct them in the right thing.
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.920]   And you are right about the buy term and invest the rest.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.600]   You would have been a great A.L. Williams rep back in the day.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.200]   - I'm gonna get him on the show one of these days.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.920]   I really, he lives here in Palm Beach.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.520]   I'm gonna get him on the show.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.400]   - But that's a great concept.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.760]   There's nothing wrong with that concept.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.080]   But like you referred to,
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.640]   it's how many people actually do it.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.920]   And honestly, I would have to guess
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.680]   maybe 1% would actually do that.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.560]   Because if you're young, you don't have the money,
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.160]   so you'll say, okay, I'm gonna buy this inexpensive term
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.440]   and I'm gonna, my idea is in five years
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.600]   I'll be able to start that investment side.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.160]   And then you maybe forget about it
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.720]   or things don't go exactly.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.560]   I mean, let's face it,
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.760]   things don't always go exactly as we planned them.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.960]   So you come up short on that investment side
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.800]   and then, like you said, as you get older,
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.720]   you're like, hey, I've got this insurance in place
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.200]   so my loved ones are taken care of
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   and I've got this money right now.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.720]   I wanna bigger house, country club, boat,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.640]   motorcycle, whatever it might be.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.880]   And you just never get to that investment side of it.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.720]   - Yeah.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.520]   The challenge, it's funny,
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.920]   on the by term and best the difference.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.240]   One of the things I've been learning
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.400]   as I've grown older and matured,
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.000]   and I learned this a lot with clients,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.080]   but I realized that when I was younger
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.880]   I was very intrigued by concepts
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.560]   and I wanted to be right.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.360]   And so I would always pick the right idea
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.640]   and often I wouldn't actually follow through.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.800]   So it's like, well, I know this is the right thing to do
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.320]   so because I know this is the right thing to do,
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.160]   I've done it.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.920]   Well, no, not necessarily.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.320]   You have to actually follow through and do it.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.000]   And I'm not the only one.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.320]   A lot of people do that,
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.440]   is we know the right thing to do
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.660]   but we haven't actually done it.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.080]   So we know, oh, I'm gonna get rich
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.200]   'cause I invest in stocks.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   Well, wait a second, have I actually sat down
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.400]   and reviewed my portfolio?
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.920]   Have I actually sat down and figured out
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.000]   how much I'm setting aside?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Have I actually done some calculations
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.840]   of how much this is gonna be worth?
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.240]   Or am I just fooling myself by making myself feel good
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.600]   because I know the right thing to do?
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.280]   So it's an interesting debate.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.960]   I wanna go back to underwriting.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   Talk to me about drugs and life insurance.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.880]   - Well, I'm currently not taking any.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.540]   (both laughing)
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.180]   You know, the drug situation is interesting.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.820]   Up until about five years ago,
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:51.580]   it had gotten actually quite easy to underwrite alcoholism,
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.780]   drug addictions, things like that.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.520]   Now it's twice as hard.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.360]   - Why?
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.540]   - I think there are more people more prone
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.540]   to wanting to try things.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.720]   And you've got a basis of young kids now
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.360]   who have more access to things.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.960]   And there's so many different drugs out there
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.520]   and people are like, well, I'm gonna try this
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.800]   and see what happens.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.400]   And the unfortunate thing
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.080]   that we've learned through underwriting,
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.400]   and some of the good things that come out of underwriting,
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.400]   by the way, that do help is we find out trends.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.480]   Trends circulate through the insurance business
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.200]   just as much as they do anywhere else.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.940]   And we're actually pretty good at predicting
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.180]   what's gonna happen with different things.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.460]   And unfortunately, 80% of people
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.100]   who go through a 30-day rehab relapse within three years.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.260]   - Wow.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.700]   - So, you know, the rehabs are great.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:51.260]   I'm not poo-pooing on a rehab.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.200]   If you need it, use it.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.360]   Good thing, but it usually takes people three times
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.500]   to finally, and that's if you're the kind of person
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.500]   who really has it in you to wanna quit,
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:07.240]   then it's like two to three times it takes
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.700]   for that to happen.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.260]   And the companies know this.
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.300]   You know, we've seen it.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.880]   So when you get somebody who just came out of rehab,
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.080]   they're in their early to mid-30s,
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.380]   they're probably gonna relapse.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.660]   So it then comes down to what were they doing before
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.940]   because they're probably gonna step it up a notch
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.620]   when they do it again.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.940]   - What about, is there a difference
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.500]   between marijuana and other drugs
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.020]   from the perspective of life insurance underwriting?
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.180]   - So the interesting thing about marijuana
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.060]   is the legalization of it anywhere
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.200]   has not changed the underwriting process.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.100]   However, if you're a casual user,
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.200]   the insurance companies almost ignore it.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.780]   You know, they've really taken on the idea
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.540]   that it's not a terrible thing to do once in a while.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.380]   - Right.
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.580]   - And they're looking at it as alcohol.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.380]   They think the same thing with alcohol.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.380]   If you're having a couple beers on the weekends,
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.500]   you have a glass of wine every night,
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.900]   that's not the worst thing ever.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.620]   We're fine with that.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:08.100]   It's the people who go to extremes
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.020]   that they're looking for.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.520]   So the worst thing you get on casual marijuana use
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.040]   in insurance underwriting currently
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.940]   is you might get a smoker rate.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.700]   You know, they're gonna get you for the smoking part.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.380]   So, but again, here's where we come down
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.220]   to admitted or not admitted.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.380]   People are afraid to admit it
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.340]   because it's technically illegal.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.460]   - Can't count the number of times.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.140]   Well, I'll take the medical exam in two weeks.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:32.980]   - Right.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.940]   - Here we go.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.040]   - Exactly.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.100]   So, you know, but you have to convince somebody to admit it
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.660]   because it is an illegal activity.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.740]   So people are afraid to put that down in writing.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.180]   - Right, understandably so.
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.120]   - Yeah, but what they have to understand
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.020]   is the insurance company is not looking to call a DEA
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.960]   and say, hey, listen, I've got, you know,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.140]   this stack of people, you know, over here.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.340]   - Send them over, they've tested positive for THC.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.420]   - So, you know, they're not doing that,
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.860]   but admitting it is the first thing
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.740]   because if you don't admit it and we find out about it,
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.740]   whether through testing or MIB, whatever the source may be,
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.460]   you're gonna get declined for not admitting it.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.000]   But so the casual marijuana use
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.820]   is treated somewhat like casual alcohol use.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.260]   Obviously, cocaine use is a no-no.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.820]   You know, that's gonna get you an auto decline
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.300]   and that's gonna be at least for two years
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.780]   from the last time you used.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:33.020]   Alcoholism, ironically, a lot of people who get DUIs,
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.060]   companies will give you one DUI usually,
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.900]   but they still won't underwrite you for two years,
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.500]   but they'll give you one without totally
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.080]   holding it over your head.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.320]   What they don't like to see is people who go to rehab
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.780]   to get out of their DUI
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.740]   because then you're admitting you're an alcoholic
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.220]   and you're postponed for even longer for going to rehab.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.260]   - Interesting.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.700]   - So it's a catch-22.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.060]   It might get you leniency on your DUI,
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.940]   but it's gonna get you tougher underwriting
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:02.980]   if you went through rehab.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.240]   - I had a buddy of mine, had a DUI,
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.780]   and he had talked about, he didn't really need insurance,
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.140]   but he, maybe I, you know, whatever.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.580]   You know, I might buy some insurance.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.280]   It's cheap, didn't really need it.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.500]   Had a DUI.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.620]   Thank goodness.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.580]   Well, you know, I didn't really need it.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.400]   Just let it go.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.500]   There was no point in it.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.340]   I think it was the two years passed
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:28.820]   and he got insurance and I got another DUI.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.300]   And I was so thankful that he had just gone ahead
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.860]   and, you know, single guy, and he's like,
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.700]   ah, whatever, it's 25 bucks a month.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:37.620]   It makes me feel good.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.060]   I got a million dollars of insurance.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.980]   It helps Joshua, sells a policy.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.220]   I didn't push him on it.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.360]   He just said, hey, if you wanna do it,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.760]   I think it's a good plan.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.700]   But thankfully he got it locked in for the second one.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.020]   - That's a good story because after the second one,
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.140]   it would have been very difficult.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:52.980]   - Yep.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.820]   - Yeah, it's a tough situation then.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.000]   But yeah, I mean, again,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.780]   it comes down to each person's situation.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.740]   - Lifestyle choices regarding sports, flying.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.100]   Do you have companies that you go to?
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.820]   Just explain how does flying and private pilot,
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.140]   that kind of stuff, work from an underwriting perspective.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.540]   - Totally opposite of what people think it does.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:19.640]   The more you fly, the better we are with it.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.680]   And people don't understand that.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.120]   But it's the occasional weekend warrior flyer
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.520]   that we don't want.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.860]   'Cause those are the guys who don't have as much training.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.480]   They don't have as many hours behind the stick.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.040]   And they're apt to take more chances
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.180]   than a normal pilot would.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.880]   Or someone who's doing it on a more regular basis.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.160]   So what the companies usually look for
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.600]   is instrument flight rating.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.420]   They love it.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:47.260]   You don't have to have it,
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.660]   but if you have it, that's just a,
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.340]   that kind of glosses over anything else
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.120]   they may be looking at.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.760]   300 hours of experience with at least
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.120]   75 to 100 hours a year flying
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.800]   is usually not even a rateable instance.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.640]   As long as you're only flying in the US.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.840]   You're not making low level trips to the Bahamas
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.800]   or Mexico or something like that,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.600]   then you're okay.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.240]   But it's the people who don't fly much
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.560]   who just got their pilot's license for giggles
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.080]   and they fly once or twice a year.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.440]   Those are the people who are gonna have a hard time
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.600]   getting coverage or you're gonna pay a flat extra for it.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.440]   - Racing.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.640]   - Depends on the racing.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.920]   If it's sanctioned racing, it's usually not a big issue.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.080]   - Sanctioned, you mean like--
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.200]   - Like NASCAR, Indy, those kinds of people.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.440]   But I will tell you that those kinds of people
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.480]   don't buy insurance.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.560]   - What do you mean?
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.160]   - Because they're risk takers and--
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.000]   - They just don't care.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:46.840]   - They're looking for the thrill
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.560]   and they really don't do it.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   We get very few professional drivers at all.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.760]   And we hear about it through the industry.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.200]   So we'll know if people are doing it or not.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.360]   And not many of them ever apply for insurance.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.600]   - So it is interesting.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.760]   But it's usually, again, it's the weekend warrior
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.160]   drag racers who wanna go up to West Palm Beach,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.600]   go to Moroso and drive their really fast car
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.680]   down the quarter mile and kill themselves in it.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.400]   Those are the guys who have a hard time getting coverage.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.080]   The actual NASCAR guys probably wouldn't be
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.120]   that big of a deal overall.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.880]   But there are times, what you have to remember
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.160]   is you look at the higher point NASCAR guys.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.500]   There's also just thousands and thousands of guys
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:36.600]   who are racing dirt track, Enduro bikes,
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   different things like that.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.800]   And those are usually flat extra.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.160]   - I never placed a racing case.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.240]   I just never came across a driver
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.520]   who was racing, so it's interesting.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.640]   - Again, most people who are thrill takers
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.000]   do not buy insurance, buy life insurance.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.520]   We get very few skydivers.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.200]   Skydiving is one that is, if you're doing it a lot,
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.440]   it is a rateable situation.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.720]   But we don't get many.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.400]   Down here in Florida, we get mostly scuba divers.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.160]   And unless you're going past 100 feet,
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.720]   they don't consider that risky at all.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.760]   And again, it's not a rateable situation.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.000]   Any others?
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.840]   I'm trying to think back to the insurance applications.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.320]   In the last two years, I can't even remember
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.960]   the special anymore, but any other
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.680]   avocation kind of stuff?
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.520]   - I don't think so.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.340]   I think we've covered it.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.920]   You do get the crazy people who do those
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.600]   ultra light flying.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.200]   I don't know whoever discovered that putting
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.560]   a parachute onto a big fan would be
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.800]   something I don't want to do.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.360]   I'm like, I think I'll stay away from that activity.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.840]   That's really about it for avocation.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.900]   You don't find much more.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.800]   Back in the day, we actually insured a couple
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.400]   of professional wrestlers.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.220]   - Really?
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.920]   - Hulk Hogan and Sergeant Slaughter
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.000]   were two of our clients that we had coverage on
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.440]   at one point.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.840]   - Nice.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.560]   - And again, that really wasn't impaired risk,
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.400]   impaired risk.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.800]   It was just more like, hey, these guys could
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.320]   have a little trauma here and there
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.040]   and we'll take care of them.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.680]   But that's really about it.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.280]   - So I want to go back to, as we start to wrap up here,
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.640]   I want to go back to the topic of policy design.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:28.280]   Over the years, so you have an interesting position
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.040]   of kind of this bird's eye view, working with
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.200]   a bunch of agents and passing things through.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.160]   What would you say, as far as number of policies,
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.400]   if you were going to guess, what percentage
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.280]   of your cases are term, universal life, whole life?
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:48.400]   - Currently, 50% term, 30 to 35% universal life
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.880]   and about 15% whole life.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   - Any gut feeling on how that's different
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.660]   than 15 years ago?
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:01.960]   - Well, 15 years ago, it would have been
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.480]   a little heavier stack on whole life,
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.240]   less on term, so it'd probably be, I would say,
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   maybe 40% term and then 60% mixture of whole life
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.160]   and UL.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:19.040]   - How do you see, so I'll tell you my concern
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.040]   with universal life, feel free to disagree.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.240]   I'm not looking for a yes answer, I'm just curious.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.140]   Here's my concern with universal life.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.560]   My observation working with clients has been
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.440]   that almost everybody who sits through
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.280]   a life insurance presentation loves some sort
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.780]   of cash value policy.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:43.560]   However, they don't love whole life premiums.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:47.380]   They love term premiums, but they love cash values
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.860]   and so you slide in a nice universal life policy
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.960]   and say, well, this gets cash values
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.300]   and it has lower premiums.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.760]   And my concern here is about the potential conflict
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.680]   of interest on the side of the agent
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.480]   because if I know, yeah, 1,000 bucks a year for term,
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.080]   10,000 bucks a year for whole life,
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.820]   but you can't afford 10, but you can afford
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.240]   a little more than 1,000, I have an incentive
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:15.160]   to talk you into something that's gonna be three to four.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.600]   And there's a substantial increase in my commission there
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.000]   for doing so and now I've introduced
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.180]   the most complicated insurance product that exists
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:29.120]   to somebody who doesn't get insurance in general,
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.000]   let alone the specifics of how to properly manage
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.320]   a universal life insurance contract.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.760]   So I get really concerned about that in the industry
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   and I get really concerned just about the clients
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.720]   not understanding it.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:47.520]   Do you think I'm right as far as that there's a potential
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.420]   and the reality of agents abusing it a little bit
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.560]   or do you think that, well, people just,
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.960]   what's your thought on that?
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.600]   - I agree with what you're saying.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.440]   I think you're on the right track.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   And the problem with universal life right now
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.980]   is that about 10 years ago, and it might be
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.200]   a little more than that, the company's got the great idea
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.920]   to guarantee universal life.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:19.080]   And what it started out as was what they called
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.680]   secondary guarantee, universal life.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.000]   So you got a return on your premium,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.640]   you got some cash value, but you also had
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.400]   a guaranteed element in there.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.720]   Well, as time went on, they realized that the people
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.200]   who were buying the guarantee ULs
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.120]   didn't care about the cash value.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.740]   All that they were looking for was what I call now
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.760]   lifetime term insurance, which is what the guarantee UL
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.580]   is of this day.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:47.740]   So for the longest time, we had to transition everybody
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.680]   to, okay, universal life is no longer used for cash value.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.240]   It's really just used for this higher term premium
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.920]   guarantee scenario.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.680]   And a few companies still had current assumption products
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.200]   that would return, but they had maybe a five year
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.040]   guarantee in them.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.980]   And you can't sell anybody anything that's only got
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.520]   a five year guarantee in it, I'm sorry.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:10.780]   It just isn't ever gonna work out for anyone.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.500]   So,
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.960]   they then decided about seven years ago,
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.400]   I think I saw the first indexed universal life contract.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.720]   So basically what you're gonna see now
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.920]   is if anybody's showing anyone any kind of a policy,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.040]   a universal life policy with cash in it,
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.200]   it's probably gonna be an index.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:36.880]   And while these products don't actually participate
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.560]   directly in the index, the S&P 500 index
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.440]   is what they're using to show the returns
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.200]   that the client could possibly get.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:49.680]   The situation comes down to where
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:55.080]   it's just very tough to show any kind of return
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.600]   in any kind of universal life contract anymore.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.840]   The whole life I think is great
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:05.560]   because there's usually a dividend attached to it.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:09.220]   And when you can participate in the company doing better,
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.200]   and you're getting some kind of a kickback,
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.940]   that's the cash you have to go.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.240]   But there's definitely people pushing the UL
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.040]   into the wrong places.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.320]   Index UL for instance is good for sales
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.160]   up to probably age 45 to 50.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.640]   And what's scary to me going to more direct
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.160]   to what you were talking about is that
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.560]   when I get a guy who calls me and says,
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:31.880]   "Hey, I've got a 65 year old, I wanna look at index UL."
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.680]   And I'm like--
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.880]   - How do you make the numbers work?
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.840]   They just don't work.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.680]   - They don't.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.680]   But they wanna look at that.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.920]   They're like, "This is what I wanna show my client."
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:45.400]   And as much as I, you know, I don't wanna tell a guy
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.540]   what to go out and sell his client
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.720]   because I don't know his client personally.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.320]   But I do know the concepts
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.400]   and what these products were developed for.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.180]   And that's not what they were developed for.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.200]   So what scares me is that they're just being used
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.760]   the wrong way.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.280]   And, you know, you made a comment,
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.120]   and I hope you don't mind if I call you on it.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.420]   But you're like, you said, you know,
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.200]   if I've got somebody who's looking at 10,000
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.700]   a whole life premium and obviously can't afford it,
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.480]   they can afford $1,000 a premium,
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:16.840]   I can probably push them to the three or four.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.320]   That might be the issue right there.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.280]   And that's exactly what happens though.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.360]   Because I think it's what happens.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.760]   And my point was that when,
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.960]   if you are an effective agent,
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.520]   if you are effective at sales,
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.720]   you can create a desire for the results.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.960]   That's what I mean is that you can create the desire
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.480]   for the $10,000 policy.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.920]   And that, but you need $10,000
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.000]   to properly fund that policy.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.080]   And what I mean by that is somebody is saying,
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.600]   well, I can buy 1,000 of term,
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.480]   but I can scratch around and come up with a couple thousand.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.680]   And I hate that conflict of interest that's there.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.680]   Where you say, well, okay, this policy,
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.460]   it's not gonna last forever,
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.680]   but it's gonna last you for 34 years.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.160]   Well, meanwhile, 34 years later, the agent is gone.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.640]   Clients are 22 years later, the client's sitting there,
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   and they got a new agent.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.760]   And I've been in this situation,
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:10.920]   I'm sure you have many times,
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.160]   and you're sitting here reviewing an in-force illustration
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.360]   saying, well, your policy got about 12 more years.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.440]   No, it's supposed to last forever.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.000]   Well, your recommended premiums were $9,822,
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.240]   and you've been paying $3,000 a year.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.440]   Oh, and you're that part of the curve
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.080]   where the rates start going up.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:34.080]   And it's, I just, that's my issue, like,
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.960]   with UL.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.800]   It's not that it's not incredibly useful.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.880]   I mean, you can, if somebody's sophisticated
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.440]   and understands it, there's nothing wrong with the concept.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.000]   But who, you know, you need a sophisticated client,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.080]   and frankly, we don't have many of them.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.180]   - Right, and what you wanna look at, too,
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:56.800]   is that that's the fallacy with a flexible premium contract.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.400]   When you go into it showing that you really need $5,000
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.420]   to fund this policy, but if you have a bad year,
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.200]   you can put 2,500 in, what's your client
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.080]   gonna walk away with?
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.360]   They're gonna remember, hey, you know what?
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.960]   I can pay 2,500, I'm still gonna have this policy.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.160]   But like you said, 20 years from now,
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.320]   you come back and all of a sudden,
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.280]   they find out there's no cash.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.920]   You know, they put all this money in,
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.160]   even if it was only 2,500, that's still a lot of money
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.960]   a year to put into a policy.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.800]   They put that money in and they're getting nothing,
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.400]   and they might even lose their coverage
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.640]   in five to 12 years.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.200]   You know, that's the fallacy
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.140]   with a flexible premium product.
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:36.140]   But it's also, I think, as agents, we need to remember.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:39.320]   'Cause even though I don't sell, you know,
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.680]   I'm not out there selling personally,
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.560]   I am a licensed agent, and I do care
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.880]   about the people we're helping.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.720]   - Absolutely.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.280]   - And that's what you've gotta think of first,
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:51.200]   because if you've got someone who's dangling by a thread
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.720]   and saying, I can pay $1,000, well, you know what?
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.460]   For the next three years, find them something
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:01.160]   that they can pay $1,000 into so that it stays on the books,
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.440]   and it stays in their life.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.240]   Because again, if you sell them the $4,000 option
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.080]   and they've gotta come up with the other three somewhere,
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.800]   how long are they gonna wanna do that?
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.840]   Or when Jimmy needs braces, where's that $3,000 gonna go?
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.880]   It's gonna go to braces.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.540]   It's not gonna go into a life insurance policy.
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.880]   So don't strap people as if their insurance
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.880]   is just another bill to pay.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.280]   Their insurance has gotta be part of their planning process,
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.600]   and I think that's where some people lose sight.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.800]   Or some people don't care.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.400]   I hate to say it that way, but there's just some--
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.240]   - There are.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.060]   - There are people who don't care.
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:32.920]   - I don't know what the percentage is,
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.000]   but there's scumbags in every business.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.140]   It's interesting.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.600]   I learned the hard way myself.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.780]   When I started selling insurance,
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:46.920]   I'm a very excited person, and so I worked on,
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.360]   okay, how can I be a great salesperson?
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.000]   And one of the things I learned was with good intention,
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   I wasn't being necessarily intentionally evil.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.780]   I wasn't trying to do something.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.440]   But I was so excited about painting the picture
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.640]   for the person that I learned
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.140]   that I was sometimes too persuasive.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:09.800]   And then I would have a client who six months later,
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.140]   they felt really good.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.420]   They didn't have buyer's remorse the next day
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.280]   or the next week or the next month,
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.960]   but the problem was I had overcommitted them
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.800]   to whatever it was that they were doing,
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.000]   the amount of money to their IRA
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.120]   or the amount of money in their life insurance policy.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:25.860]   And then all of a sudden, I had a series of clients,
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.080]   and okay, Joshua, I gotta cash out the IRA.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.320]   No, I gotta cancel the policy.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.160]   No.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.000]   - Right.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.200]   - And I just, I hated that.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   Because I felt responsible because they were behind.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.040]   Whether it was if it was insurance,
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:45.520]   they was too soon, and we hadn't even caught up with costs,
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:48.080]   policy inception costs, commissions, and all that stuff yet.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.160]   Or if it was IRAs, we're taking tax money out,
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.720]   and they're behind the curve.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:57.080]   And I learned to be myself less persuasive
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:00.160]   because I needed to avoid getting the client excited
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.400]   and saying, yeah, I'll write big checks to my future.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.720]   Where's the investment?
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.600]   And I had to actually change my mindset
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.400]   and be a little bit more relaxed and say,
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.840]   okay, I know you're excited now.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.080]   Let's start with less or put some money into a side fund,
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.660]   and let's come back in six months,
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.000]   and six months, and six months.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.640]   Which was the exact opposite of what I thought
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.400]   was gonna be my approach when I started studying sales.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.760]   - Well, the good thing about your process
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.680]   is you learn from it.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:28.520]   - Yeah.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.700]   - There's a lot of people who don't,
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:32.160]   or again, they just don't care to learn from it.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:37.120]   And I think that could be the hurtful side for the client,
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.920]   is you definitely want somebody who cares.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.000]   And I think that's what planners in general
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.280]   have to remember is treat everyone like
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.920]   they're your mom or your dad.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.640]   I mean, would you do that to your mom or your dad?
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.480]   And if you wouldn't, then maybe you shouldn't be doing it
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.520]   with these people.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.280]   And take that concept a little more broadly.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:59.180]   And you're much better off to keep things on the books.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:03.300]   And believe me, most people who you help
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.420]   will remember that later on when you come back
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.520]   for policy reviews or for future sales,
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.900]   or when they need something,
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.300]   and they feel that they wanna come to you,
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.300]   they're gonna come to you then.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.620]   - What do you see as the future of the career
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.060]   of the life insurance agent?
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:23.900]   - Career agents are hurting.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.460]   It's not a great time to be a career agent.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:31.260]   And I don't say that to be a negative.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.300]   I think it's the reality.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:38.100]   Most companies who used to recruit agents
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.540]   and work with them and help them build their business
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.240]   and really give them a platform to be successful
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.440]   are few and far between.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.860]   I'm not gonna name names.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.260]   There's a couple of companies who do still do that
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.820]   and do a really good job at that.
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.500]   There are companies who are currently
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.660]   only recruiting top of the table
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.940]   MDRT qualifying agents right now.
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.260]   If you don't qualify at least MDRT,
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.100]   you could lose your job.
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.020]   You could be an agent for 20 years
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.020]   and you just went along, you never cared about MDRT.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.540]   You were like, hey, I'm good with this,
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.620]   where I'm at with this, I'm helping people, I'm doing it.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.580]   You can find yourself an independent pretty quick.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.800]   The companies just aren't training
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.060]   and they don't wanna put the effort into training
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.980]   and recruiting newer people
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.100]   and helping them grow a business.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.260]   Again, there's still a couple of companies out there
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.540]   that are doing a really good job,
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.560]   but here locally I know the talk is
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.820]   people are cross-recruiting
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.620]   and trying to pull agents away from other companies
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.020]   that already have their book of business
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.160]   and that's what they wanna look at.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.480]   So the unfortunate side of that is there's different,
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.280]   I don't know if you would call them companies,
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.340]   but there's different resources out there
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.140]   for agents to learn and to be taught,
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.260]   but they're fairly expensive.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.620]   They're not hands-on where you have a mentor
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.380]   in the office you can go to,
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.300]   so it makes being an independent really tough.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.500]   But that's the way a lot of guys
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.720]   are gonna probably have to go.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.340]   And that's when a decent,
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.860]   having some decent background
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.740]   and knowing what you're doing,
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.220]   hopefully you can get that in
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.460]   before something else happens.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.100]   But that's how I see it.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.060]   I know the internet and you can go online
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.460]   and buy insurance and you can do those different things.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.740]   I never, I still don't believe
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.620]   that's gonna take away from the career agent.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.140]   You're gonna always get people
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.260]   who are kind of like buying small policies
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.140]   that you can't live selling anyway,
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.820]   but I still think the relationship side of the business
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:45.260]   and being a good agent and caring about your clients
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.220]   is what's gonna keep things going for guys.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.380]   - I just don't see how,
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.580]   and I know we've talked about this privately, you and I,
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:03:01.300]   I don't see, when you have a little bit of experience
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.420]   and you start to see all the ways that can go wrong,
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.560]   I feel, so it's been almost a year now
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.860]   that I've been out of the day-to-day,
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.940]   I feel like I'm losing touch.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.360]   There have been so many changes
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.700]   and I feel like I'm losing touch
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.620]   with change in the marketplace.
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:19.860]   And yes, somebody who's completely healthy
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:24.820]   and not a single issue whatsoever,
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.900]   no risk factors at all, just kind of says,
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.060]   "I'll buy 20 times my income of life insurance."
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.340]   They can, you can go online
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.180]   to whatever term, lifeinsurance.com
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.500]   or whatever version of it is,
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.260]   plunk the numbers in, blah, blah, blah,
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:42.180]   and that 20-year term, it's probably gonna be fine.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.980]   Chances are it's an A-rated company,
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.340]   chances it's a cheap policy, pay the premium,
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.460]   it's probably gonna be fine, probably.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.900]   But you change any factor at all.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.460]   And I don't see any way that the average consumer
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:58.540]   is gonna be effectively able to negotiate that maze
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:02.300]   without somebody to hold their hands.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:07.180]   And I don't see how many of the companies
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.580]   that advertise, as far as the brokerage agencies,
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:14.580]   I don't see how they can train people who answer the phone
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.900]   with the depth of knowledge that they need
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.140]   to give a really professional answer.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:23.860]   And so my problem is that I empathize and understand
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.220]   with the people who don't wanna be life insurance agents
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.860]   'cause I didn't wanna be a life insurance agent.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.180]   When I started 23 years old in 2008,
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.860]   what 23-year-old in 2008 says,
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.780]   "I'm gonna go be a life insurance agent."
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.620]   - Exactly.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:37.900]   - It was just a means to an end for me
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.540]   to become the Mr. Financial Planner.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.140]   But now that I see the value, I could go the other way
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.100]   and I could happily just do life insurance
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.560]   because of the value there.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.740]   But I don't see that message being talked about
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.220]   in the industry and it really concerns me.
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.140]   - Yeah, it really isn't a message that's out there
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.060]   for any of us.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.100]   Everybody wants assets under management,
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.060]   is a big word I hear constantly.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:06.140]   They wanna know, "What are your assets under management?
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:09.020]   "How much wealth planning are you doing?"
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.340]   And things like that.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.740]   And to me, it all kinda goes together.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:15.100]   I mean, wealth planning is great, that's perfect.
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.680]   If you've got the clients who are doing that.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.820]   But there's probably an insurance need there too.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.600]   And if you have other clients that you have access to
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.000]   that maybe don't have that wealth
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.960]   and just need the insurance planning,
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.260]   that's where it oughta be.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.800]   Yeah, I don't understand it either.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.840]   The interesting thing I find about the online buying,
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.280]   I've actually listened to some conversations
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.720]   in different places and I never tell people what I do
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.040]   when I'm listening to the conversations.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.560]   But there's an opinion out there that if you go directly
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.220]   to these online places to buy your life insurance,
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.180]   that you're getting the cheapest insurance anywhere.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.020]   - I'm glad you said that,
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.700]   'cause I was gonna get the very next question.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.980]   - What's interesting about that is that there's no difference
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.260]   in premium to what they're getting
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:04.700]   versus what I can show my agents to sell 'em
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.100]   across the board either.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:08.940]   So what's happening for the companies
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.880]   is a nice thing for them,
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.380]   is that they're selling insurance policies
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.660]   without paying anyone a commission to do it.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.380]   Or a very small commission.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.120]   Obviously there's a money switching hands there somewhere,
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.500]   but it's probably a lot less than,
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.460]   but the client's not getting any benefit from that.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.340]   It's not like they're getting $10 a month cheaper
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.700]   on their term insurance because they bought it online
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:32.180]   versus taking a half an hour to talk with an agent
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.420]   and make sure they're getting the right thing.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.720]   - Yeah, that's exactly the,
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.140]   I'm glad you point that out,
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.060]   'cause I think people don't realize that.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:45.860]   And if I'm gonna sell a Banner Life policy,
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.020]   whether you go to termlifeinsurance.com
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.820]   and buy your 20-year Banner Life,
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.100]   or you buy it from Joshua,
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.180]   either Joshua makes his 500 bucks,
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.940]   or termlifeinsurance.com makes the 500 bucks.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.980]   But at least with Joshua,
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.060]   you can get an hour or two or three of my time,
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.780]   and I'll make sure that,
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.020]   and help answer your questions,
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.020]   and it's not completely blind.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.440]   It's a little better than an online calculator.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.900]   And so, I think people don't recognize that
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.100]   and realize that.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.460]   Do you know of any life insurance company
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:22.380]   that sells insurance without commissions,
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.180]   without paying somebody commissions?
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:30.340]   - Off the top of my head for what we do
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.660]   and the market we're in now,
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:37.660]   you might find that some of the smaller guarantees,
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.400]   you type products.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.600]   - Good call.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:45.160]   - There's a few companies that offer no medical questions,
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.040]   you can't be declined,
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.200]   everyone's seeing the advertisements.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.120]   Those are probably non-commissioned products
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.920]   that are direct with the company,
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.240]   kind of a direct buy situation.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.280]   But I don't think there's anybody
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.680]   who's doing anything substantial
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.000]   that isn't paying a commission to someone to do it.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.520]   - So, this gets my fee-only buddies really upset
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.360]   because they're like,
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.320]   "Oh, we can do investments without commissions.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.240]   "Why can't we do insurance without commissions
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.040]   "and stay fee-only?"
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.600]   Do you think it'll happen?
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.040]   Do you think any of the companies
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.680]   will try to work within that?
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.760]   Because that's the press that the market is pushing
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.320]   and the consumers seem to be pushing
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.980]   is towards the concept of fee-only,
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.640]   without talking about whether it's a good concept
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.480]   or not a concept.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.680]   Can you see it happen?
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.000]   - I don't see it happening.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.360]   I just don't see the life insurance companies
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.220]   getting to that point.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.520]   There's a little bit of commission competitiveness
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.200]   between companies.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.640]   And I think they get the feeling,
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.700]   whether it's right or wrong,
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.760]   that that's helping them push product.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.340]   If you pay five points more,
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:49.800]   maybe somebody's gonna push your product
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.680]   over XYZ company that's paying a little bit less.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.680]   But here at our agency,
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.640]   we're more about quality of company
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.340]   and where the need fits.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.640]   Not to mention we're underwriting most of our cases.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.280]   So, it's not just a cut and dry,
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.040]   hey, I'm gonna send you to company A or B.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.280]   I've gotta look at company A through Z
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:10.180]   and kind of figure out where it's going.
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.720]   But I haven't personally heard any talk
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.200]   about insurance companies wanting to do life products
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.080]   on a fee-only basis.
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.560]   I'm sure it's probably getting talked about
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.800]   behind closed doors,
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   but I don't see any move in that direction at this point.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.360]   - It'd be interesting to watch.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.000]   It'll be interesting to watch.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.280]   I just was curious if you'd heard any scuttle.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.640]   So, as we close,
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.360]   tell, just give the audience just a little bit of idea
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.000]   about your company and who you can serve.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.760]   I know you're not individually working with individuals,
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.520]   so they can't necessarily call you with any life insurance.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.960]   But if somebody's a broker,
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:49.880]   they can connect with you and reach out to you.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.720]   Go ahead and--
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.480]   - Yeah, we work with brokers
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:55.360]   in helping them get their clients what they need.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.280]   We don't deal directly with the public
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.640]   and I just think that's a better concept for us
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.480]   in the way that we do business.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.720]   We'd rather deal with the agents
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.080]   who have already got their situation in place
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.800]   and kind of use us as a secondary source
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.680]   to help them get to the end.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.840]   And that's what we do well.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.080]   And again, the impaired risk is our primary.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.840]   I mean, we can write anything,
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.760]   for preferred best, the highest rating there is.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.680]   But my background is primarily impaired risk underwriting.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.240]   So that's where I'm gonna be the strongest
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.000]   with most things.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.880]   - And I guess I would say the one thing
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.920]   that individual consumers could do,
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.440]   if you find yourself in a situation
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.200]   where you are facing some kind of impaired risk situation,
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.560]   ask your, find a life insurance agent
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.160]   and your life insurance agent can reach out to Todd.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.040]   And if nothing else, you know,
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.960]   Todd, you work with people from all over,
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.040]   in many companies, many independents,
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.800]   you work with dozens of companies
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.200]   and you're a good resource.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.800]   So just ask your agent, say,
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.400]   at least reach out to this guy
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.640]   and see if you can do it.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.440]   Because just because you get a decline in one place,
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.480]   I mean, the case that you got for me,
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.840]   we never placed it.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.800]   But the one that just, it was early in my career
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.600]   and I didn't have a clue what to do,
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.080]   except I had this person and usually,
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.080]   usually life insurance,
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.480]   life insurance sales is an interesting business
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.800]   'cause there's a little,
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.920]   usually a little bit of tension,
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.320]   there's a little bit of desire,
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   but I don't wanna talk about it
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.840]   'cause no one wants to get into it.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.720]   So I remember I walked into this office one time
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.240]   and it was at a university
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.800]   and I was speaking with this lady
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.400]   and she's like, "Oh, you sell life insurance?"
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.520]   I said, "Yeah."
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.760]   And she said, "Oh, tell you what,
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.040]   "we would love to have some life insurance."
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.760]   Said, "But I gotta warn you,
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.520]   "it's for my husband and he's been declined
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.560]   "three times in the last year."
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.560]   And I said, "Oh, I'm totally wet behind the ears,
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.400]   "I don't have a clue."
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.200]   And I was like, "Well, give me the information."
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.320]   You know, super eager, well, I'll do my best.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.680]   You know, so I write down all the information,
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.760]   I called her husband, find out what he needed
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.080]   and just what people said was,
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.040]   you know, the guys in my office, "Call Todd."
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.560]   So I called Todd and we submitted the case,
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.480]   we submitted an informal inquiry and we got an offer.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.720]   And the cool thing about it,
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.760]   we couldn't place the case because it didn't make,
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.800]   even though it was an offer, it was still too much
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.920]   and it didn't make sense for the client.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.080]   The need wasn't that great
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.520]   compared to the cost of the premiums.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.860]   But it gave me a real confidence
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.660]   to feel like I knew I could add some value.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:25.600]   And that was what I struggled with, was confidence
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600]   and knowing that I added value.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.400]   Anytime you're in a sales situation,
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.360]   you gotta know like, okay, here's why I'm worth this money.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.960]   And I felt like, oh, I could get people insurance
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.860]   that three other agents couldn't get
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.960]   'cause I've got Todd Simpson in my back pocket.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.800]   So thank you.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.280]   - I'm glad to hear that and I'm glad we could help out.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.200]   And it is interesting, Joshua,
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.840]   because obviously not every case gets placed.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.200]   I mean, just because we can get an offer
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.680]   doesn't mean it's gonna be affordable for somebody.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.800]   But I like to hear that we were able to do that for you.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.800]   And I hope it doesn't sound corny that after 31 years,
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.720]   that's my favorite part about the business
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.820]   is to have somebody tell me that I helped them.
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:08.960]   And I'm not gonna say it's just as good as a paycheck.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:09.920]   (laughing)
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.120]   - The two together is a pretty good combination.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.360]   - Exactly.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.120]   I'd like to get paid and feel good.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.920]   - Todd, thanks for coming on the show.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:18.760]   I really appreciate it.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.180]   - Anytime, I appreciate you having me.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.020]   Thank you.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.540]   (whooshing)
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.580]   - So now you've been behind the scenes
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:27.460]   of the life insurance business.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.740]   And hopefully some of you who are younger,
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.220]   who don't think much about life insurance,
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.380]   hopefully you benefited from my talking
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:36.700]   about all those different disease things,
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.980]   the different special risks of medical risks,
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.760]   different occupation and avocation risks.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.980]   That stuff matters.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:48.980]   And it's a challenge to know how to express that
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.360]   because on the one hand,
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.000]   a lot of people don't really need insurance
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.360]   and you can't ever buy a ton of insurance
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.560]   just 'cause someday you might need it.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.320]   That would be unwise.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.760]   But yet sometimes you could be thankful
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.680]   of buying insurance before you needed it.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.260]   I think of the story I shared in that interview
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.760]   with that friend of mine who had gotten a DUI.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.180]   That's a big deal with insurance underwriting.
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:17.620]   Now, as far as where the right move is, I don't know.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.560]   Some people are open to the idea of insurance.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.280]   They like insurance.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.280]   I've learned that I tend to be in that situation.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.880]   I don't like too much insurance.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.120]   I really don't like to spend a lot of money on premiums.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.440]   But there are some types of insurance
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.400]   that make me feel really good.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.560]   Again, I had life insurance before I was ever married
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.840]   because I wanted it there to support my family.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.960]   Now, I was certainly biased
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.400]   in that I was an insurance agent.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.360]   So was I just doing it so that I would buy into my product
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.440]   or did I really buy it because I valued it?
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.880]   Well, in the beginning, I think I was just doing it
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.560]   because I valued my product,
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.600]   but then I, excuse me, because I was trying to be consistent
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.780]   and I needed to own what I sold.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.800]   But then I've discovered the feelings of owning it.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.480]   And I started to have that same experience with other people.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.640]   So I leave you free, obviously, to make your own decision.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.560]   But consider if having a bit of an insurance plan in place
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.720]   at an earlier age might not help,
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.200]   at least something minimal.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.960]   The way I look at it is I waste money,
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.040]   believe it or not, I waste money.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.200]   I waste $10 here, $20 there.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.880]   I try not to, but having $20 a month
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.400]   of term life insurance premiums in place
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.360]   to have half a million dollars of coverage
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.400]   as a young guy, to me,
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.120]   didn't really feel like that big of a problem.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.680]   And it can open up a lot of options as time goes on.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.480]   Hope this was useful to you.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.320]   If any of you are in need of insurance
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.600]   and you have a special risk, ask your broker,
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.360]   find an insurance agent, ask them to work with Todd.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.960]   They do a great job.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.440]   So that's the best solution that I have for you there
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.920]   to be able to improve your situation.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.960]   You can't work with him directly.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.520]   But I will tell you a secret.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.560]   Well, it's not I'm about to tell you,
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.360]   but I guess not technically a secret.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.200]   I should be careful.
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.080]   But their website is called thestamagency.com.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   The, T-H-E, STAM, S-T-A-M-M, agency.com.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.040]   They have on that kit, excuse me, on their website,
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.080]   it's not a consumer facing website.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.280]   It's not intended for the general public.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.680]   It's intended for brokers, actual life insurance agents.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.040]   But they have a tool on there that's called Term Quotes.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.760]   And this is a quoting system that will quote for you
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:34.360]   insurance policies with actual premiums.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.760]   Now, of course, you don't know exactly
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.440]   what underwriting classification you're gonna get.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.880]   Although on that, you can use it
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.280]   and you can talk about any prospective ratings
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.680]   or what you think the classification will be.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.760]   This is not a consumer friendly tool
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.360]   in the sense of it's not a click through menu system.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.720]   This is an agent tool.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.200]   This is exactly the same quoting tool
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.400]   that I've used many times.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.760]   But this is the first place I go to get quotes.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.200]   But the secret is this is a way that you can get term quotes
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.400]   without having to get your name onto a solicitation list.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.440]   Oftentimes, many of the websites out there,
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.080]   you have to put your name in, your info in,
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.040]   and then that puts you on the list.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.520]   Then you gotta get the calls
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:10.960]   from the life insurance agent.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.520]   So sometimes some of you will do that
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.400]   and you put in a fake name and a fake email address
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.000]   and a fake phone number and all that.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.160]   Well, if you wanna bypass that,
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.520]   and you're just interested in trying to figure out
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.480]   what would be some quotes for life insurance,
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.960]   you can use this quote engine here.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.520]   And again, you can't buy it on here.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.040]   You have to work with an agent,
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.060]   but this will give you the prices across companies.
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.900]   And some of you that are kind of interested
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.880]   in the actual behind the scenes stuff
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.200]   will benefit from this.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.320]   So you'll find that it's thestamagency.com.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.400]   Click on term quotes and you can put in the information
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.640]   and you can figure out all the details.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.200]   You can see all the carriers, you can see all the premiums.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.000]   If you know of a certain number of ratings,
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.720]   you can put the table rating in there.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.920]   Again, it's not a consumer focused site,
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.200]   it's an agent site.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.760]   But some of you will like being able to quote insurance
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.040]   without having to go through the solicitation process,
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.640]   the marketing tool that many of the online
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.480]   quote engines will do.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.060]   So there's my little tip of the day.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.080]   Thank you all so much for listening.
