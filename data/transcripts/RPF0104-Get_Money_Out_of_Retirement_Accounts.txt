[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.340]   I've gotten a lot of questions with all of the early retirement interviews I've played
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.660]   on this show about how all these people are going to access the money that they have stuffed
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.400]   away in retirement accounts if they retire before the age of 59 and a half.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.720]   After all, aren't they going to have to pay the penalty tax to get their money out?
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.040]   Today, I'm going to answer that question and give this show a shot.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.520]   Whether you're a beginner or an expert on this subject, I think I might have some ideas
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:10.360]   that will help you.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.660]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.660]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.880]   Thank you for being here.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.620]   Today is Monday, November 17, 2014.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.180]   Today I'm going to tell you why you might not pay the penalty taxes even if you retire
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.180]   before 59 and a half.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.620]   Then I'm going to tell you how to avoid them all if you want to.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.780]   I'll give you all the answers for that.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:43.100]   Today's going to save you some money, so stay tuned.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.900]   As we wade into the weeds of retirement rules and laws and things like that, I'm going to
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.340]   ask you to do me a favor.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.340]   Give today a shot.
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.580]   I'm going to try to do this with a minimum of detail, meaning I'm not going to get down
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.740]   to the technical weeds.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.300]   I'm going to try to answer this big picture with just enough detail and then let me know
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.100]   how I did.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.020]   I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.380]   I feel like I can do it.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.740]   Two quick announcements as we start.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.100]   Number one, as I've been saying for the last week, I wound up deleting all of you who are
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.060]   subscribed to my show in iTunes.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.060]   It was accidental.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.060]   Trust me.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.460]   That's not something that a podcaster wants to do is delete the majority of their audience
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.980]   when you work so hard to build an audience.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.180]   If you are subscribed to my show in iTunes or even if you're subscribed in many other
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.860]   podcast apps, many podcast apps actually use iTunes and scrape from iTunes the info, then
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.780]   please make sure that you are receiving updates on the show in your app after episode 99.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.940]   This is when it would have happened.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.220]   If you are receiving today, which is episode what?
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.300]   103, I think, or 104, something like that.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   Then 104.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.700]   Then if you're receiving after today, then that's great.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.500]   If not, unsubscribe from the show, look in the store or the directory for the show, and
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.740]   then click subscribe.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.140]   If you're not subscribed to the show, why not?
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.140]   Subscribe.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.900]   Number two, for you international listeners, I apologize.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.340]   Today's going to be fairly US-centric.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.100]   I think there'll be some info in here that you'll benefit from.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.500]   About 80% of the audience is based in the US and 20% is international.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.540]   The top three, 5% in Canada, 5% in the UK, and 5% in Germany, and then the remaining
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.300]   5% scattered around the world.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.820]   I thank all of you for listening.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.780]   I never in my life imagined I would be speaking to an international audience.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.540]   Several of you, especially the Canadians, have emailed me and asked me to do shows on
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.500]   Canadian personal finance topics.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   I would love to do that.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.060]   I think it'd be really fun to do.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.900]   I don't know a thing about your laws, so I'm going to have to do that in terms of an interview
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.900]   format.
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.340]   If you've got somebody that you think would be a great guest on the show to talk about
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.260]   financial planning from a Canadian perspective, especially if they might know things that
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.780]   are similar, dissimilar, I'd love to learn about it.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.940]   I can do that in an interview format.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.020]   If you've got somebody, ask them to email me or you email me for them, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.580]   Let's get into the show.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.780]   We're not going into the weeds today.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.900]   I'm going to stay with some big picture concepts, but I'm going to give you enough detail that
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.300]   this is actually going to be useful.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.660]   I've gotten this question several times, and although I have covered it briefly on a previous
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.180]   show, I think in the show where the guy wrote me and says, "I'm 35 years old.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.180]   I got a million bucks.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.980]   I hate my job and I don't want to retire," at the end of that show, I put some of this
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.980]   info in.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.700]   The number one response I got on that show, I think it was episode 55, it might have been,
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.820]   was, "Joshua, you crammed like eight shows into one.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.420]   That seems to be my disease."
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.460]   So I wanted to create a standalone show to answer this question, and that's what we have
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.460]   today.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.420]   I used to be very scared by this question or by this problem, and you probably have
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.460]   been or are right now.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.460]   You know what?
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.580]   Maybe you should be because when you get into the world of figuring out what are the penalty
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.940]   taxes and things like that, it just doesn't sound fun, dealing with penalty taxes.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.220]   None of us really want to deal with penalties and none of us really want to pay taxes.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.740]   One of the big problems in this area is actually the problem of perspective.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.100]   Who are we talking about?
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.660]   So you've heard where this question comes from is if you've listened to my show and
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.540]   you've heard various early retirees, people planning on retiring at 30, 40, 50 years old,
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.020]   and you're saying, "But they have all this money in 401(k)s.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.220]   What do they do?"
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.500]   And if you go and listen to mainstream personal finance topics, you find that the standard
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.540]   advice is don't ever take money out of your retirement accounts early.
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.060]   You have to wait until 59 and a half.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.060]   Why would you ever take money early?
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.940]   This is especially tough when you listen to radio shows.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.860]   So for example, two of my favorites, if you listen to Clark Howard or Dave Ramsey, if
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.900]   they get a listener, unless they do a lot of probing and find something out, the majority
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.700]   of the time when people call them up and say, "Hey Clark or Dave, I need to distribute
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.380]   money from my 401(k), should I take money out of my 401(k) to pay off my credit card
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.380]   debt?"
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.540]   Well, the most common answer you'll hear is no, absolutely not.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.540]   And here's why.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.500]   Here's the math you'll hear.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.500]   No Mr. Collar, if you're Ms. Collar, because you're going to pay a 10% penalty tax plus
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.380]   you're going to pay taxes on the money.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.740]   So let's say you're going to pay 30% taxes.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.620]   So you've got 30 plus 10, that's 40%.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.940]   Practically half your money, you're going to lose half your money to taxes and penalties,
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.300]   so therefore you shouldn't do it.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.300]   Now is that true?
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   Well, it might be.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.300]   I don't know.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.820]   I mean going from 40 to 50 is kind of a big deal where we just automatically say half
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.740]   and I'll tell you I have been guilty of that working with a client who's called me in the
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.740]   same situation.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.140]   I'm like, "Well, you basically lose half your money.
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.540]   It's half your money."
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.540]   I've done that myself.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.540]   I've done that myself.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.180]   So maybe I need to atone for that with today's show.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.300]   But there's a big difference between that type of caller and that type of situation
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.620]   versus somebody who is financially sophisticated and understands the rules and has a plan for
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.620]   early retirement.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.620]   They have a lot of money.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.620]   They're saving money.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.380]   They're using their retirement accounts as a tool.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.020]   And this is a big difference.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.660]   And this is one of the reasons it's tough.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.540]   If you're used to listening to mainstream financial talk, nothing wrong with that.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.540]   That's great.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.540]   But you've got to recognize that you probably have a different perspective than maybe what
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.300]   I talk about on this show.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.900]   There's a big difference between saying, "I've got to take my money out to pay off my credit
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.100]   card debt," when the majority of people that I'm bringing on this show, at least to talk
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:19.340]   about early retirement, credit card debt is nowhere near an issue.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.260]   It's just not even in the same ballpark.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.580]   That's why it's kind of tough for me to answer questions on credit card debt because I just
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.340]   don't think that much about it.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.700]   If you have credit card debt and if you're paying interest on it and it's not deductible
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.460]   interest, I'm just like, "What are you doing?
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.780]   Why would you do that?"
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.900]   So there's a little bit of a different approach to my show versus the other.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.260]   So you've got to ask yourself the question, "How sophisticated are you when you're actually
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.540]   doing this problem?
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.780]   Do you need help on the fundamentals of finance, the fundamentals of getting out of debt, working
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.820]   hard, planning a budget, doing that?
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.180]   Or are you ready to go a little bit deeper?"
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.020]   If you're sophisticated and if you're deeper, that's where this conversation is going to
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.020]   go.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.940]   If you're dealing with the question of, "Should I take money out of my 401(k) to pay off my
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.940]   credit card debt?"
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.340]   The answer is probably not.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.340]   Probably not.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.860]   It's usually not going to be a good plan.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.980]   But you still could calculate it, but that's not the realm that we're talking about today.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.460]   If you take all of the emotion out of this answer and you take all of the rules that
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.820]   you've heard about, "Don't only take money out of your 401(k) if you're going to declare
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.820]   bankruptcy or escape foreclosure," that's probably a good rule of thumb.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.300]   I like rules of thumb.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.460]   But it's one thing to have the rule of thumb.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.140]   It's another thing to go beyond the rule of thumb and understand it.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.780]   If we actually understand it, we basically have two questions that we're trying to figure
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.780]   out.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:39.660]   Number one is, "What is the cost versus the benefit of paying income taxes now versus
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.260]   paying them later?"
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:47.800]   Number two, "What is the cost versus the benefit of paying the extra 10% penalty tax now or
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.740]   not paying it later?"
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.740]   That's it.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.660]   So why did I start with all those tax planning shows in the beginning?
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.060]   Go back and check out the tax series.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.060]   It's all there in your feed, freely available.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.900]   All we're doing here is adjusting the timing of income.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.820]   That's all this is, is a timing strategy.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.980]   And you're just saying, "Do I take the timing of income forward or do I push the timing
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.260]   of income back?
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.620]   Do I take this deduction now or do I push the deduction back?"
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.220]   So let's handle the income taxes first.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.100]   You are always going to pay income taxes on the money if you're using a retirement account.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.780]   You're always going to do it, period.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:29.340]   You're either going to do it now because you're participating in a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k)
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.180]   and so you're choosing to pay the income tax now and to avoid it later, or you're going
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.300]   to pay it later.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:42.580]   If you're participating in a traditional 401(k), a traditional IRA, a simplified employee pension
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.880]   plan, a SEP, a simple IRA, you're just taking the deduction now.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.060]   So all we're doing is we're choosing, "Am I going to pay now or later?
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.060]   Now or later?
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.420]   Do I push the tax off, pay it later?
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.020]   Do I bring the tax forward and pay it now?"
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.940]   And the answer to that question is pure math.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.940]   What's in your best interest?
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.900]   Well, you have to actually calculate it.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.900]   You have to look at your situation.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.220]   You have to look at your plans.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now with regard to the penalty tax, it's still just a timing question.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.680]   Do I pay the penalty tax in order to have the money now or do I not pay the penalty
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.900]   tax later?
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.820]   Now you would think that would be straightforward, right?
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.820]   But it's not.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.980]   Well, in some ways it is, but it's not.
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.480]   Here would be an example.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.700]   If I tell you that in your 401(k) you're going to average 10% on your money and you're going
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:33.380]   to take that 10% on the money and you're going to keep it invested, thus avoiding the 10%
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.220]   penalty tax now, you're going to get a 10% rate of return annually over the next 30 years.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.820]   Or you can go ahead and take the money that you have in there now, pay the 10% penalty
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:48.220]   tax and invest the money at 110% rate of return compounded annually for the next 30 years.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.980]   Which would you do?
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.260]   Obviously if I could guarantee it, and of course I can't, but it's just a mental game,
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.780]   obviously you would take the 110% rate of return because you would make up far in excess
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.460]   of the cost of the 10% tax.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.700]   So therefore all we're doing here is trying to figure out should I pay the 10% penalty
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.020]   tax or should I not pay the 10% penalty tax?
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.980]   And there are various ways to answer it.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.060]   Do I value the money now or do I value not paying the tax?
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.780]   It's not a law, it's not a rule, it's not a religion, it's just a matter of when do
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.980]   I value it?
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.300]   What's my plan for it?
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.420]   If you're going to take the money out and that money is just going to go to pay off
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.420]   credit card debt and you're taking money out and you're paying half the money in taxes
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.380]   and penalties and fees so that you can pay off credit card debt at a 10% interest or
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.240]   15% interest, probably not a good plan.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.540]   But if you're taking it out to invest in your business that is guaranteed to be the next
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.060]   big IPO success, maybe it is a good plan.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.360]   There have been plenty of entrepreneurs who have taken early distributions out of their
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.060]   accounts and made way more than they ever would have had by having the money in their
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.060]   accounts.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.460]   There are many, many businesses that have been started and funded based upon pensions.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:06.740]   There are many businesses, whether that was Colonel Sanders just living on Social Security
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.780]   while he starts Kentucky Fried Chicken or whether it was JCPenney, either starting JCPenney
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.940]   or rescuing JCPenney with money from his cash value life insurance policy or people taking
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.340]   distributions from their 401(k)s to start their dream.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.340]   That's fine.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.860]   I've got lots of friends that have done that.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.220]   So get the emotion out of it and understand what the rules are and then you can coach
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.420]   yourself or somebody else through it.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.980]   And it's basically what do I expect to do better?
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.780]   That's it.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.060]   Now all tax planning is very specific.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.140]   You have to look at your situation.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.900]   And I'm going to say things in today's show that are going to be absolutely contradictory
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.900]   to one another.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.860]   All you've got to do is just avoid, avoid, avoid, and that's your key.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.340]   Now the question is what are you avoiding?
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.880]   Sometimes we'll choose to pay some taxes in order to avoid paying another one.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:57.020]   So we can avoid the 10% penalty tax, but we might choose to pay it to avoid paying a higher
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.780]   income tax.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.140]   That's basically it.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.940]   Same thing with we can avoid the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, by paying a higher
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.620]   amount of income tax because we choose that the higher income tax is a better deal than
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.380]   the AMT.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.460]   Same thing with we're doing tax planning for this new Medicare tax.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.900]   We're just simply avoiding.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.940]   So you've got to look at your situation.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.300]   And what you need to do is just calculate it out, figure out what the cost is, figure
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:28.220]   out what the benefit is, figure out what the plan is, and make that decision.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.700]   The key with the early retiree scenarios is that they have flexibility.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:39.540]   And that's what's often missing in mainstream financial advice is there's no flexibility.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.380]   If you're stretched to the max with income equaling expenses and no money to pay off
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.860]   credit cards, there's no flexibility.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.380]   You can't take advantage of strategies like we're going to talk about here that the early
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.220]   retirees have grabbed onto.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.140]   So you've got to have flexibility.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.300]   Now there are real quick answer, and we're going to get to the four different options
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.500]   that I'm going to explain to you today.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.620]   But there are a bunch of detailed rules and exceptions for each type of account.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.980]   I do not want to cover those in today's show because I want to do shows at some point on
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.340]   about a specific topic.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.660]   So the early distribution rules are different for IRAs than they are for 401(k)s.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.620]   And they're different for IRAs than they are for Roth IRAs with the exceptions.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.380]   So the death exception, the disability, the first-time home purchase, the medical expenses,
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   the medical insurance premiums during unemployment, the higher education costs.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.700]   Some of these exceptions that you can find to paying the 10% penalty, they exist, but
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.300]   I don't want to cover them today because it just gets us too down in the weeds.
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.180]   And you've got to figure out, depending on whether you have a Roth or a traditional IRA,
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.180]   that makes a difference.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.300]   And with a Roth, you've got to figure out are we avoiding the 10% penalty tax or are
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.100]   we also avoiding the income tax on the money.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.500]   With 401(k)s, you've got double counting of rules.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.500]   So if you've got the Roth rules with a Roth 401(k), you've got your five-year rules that
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.340]   apply because of the Roth portion, but you've got the challenge of how do I get my in-service
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.180]   distribution out of a 401(k).
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.140]   You could take a loan, but the loan has its own issues.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.700]   Does your plan offer loans?
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.540]   So there's all kinds of issues with it.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.700]   So I'm not getting into those weeds.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.300]   I want to give you four answers, though, to help you organize your thinking, at least
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.980]   to understand why and how all these early retirees I brought on the show are avoiding
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.980]   the tax or how they're making rational decisions.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.300]   There are four answers to this question, how are they doing it.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.860]   And I'm going to give you the four and then we're going to go through them in detail.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.780]   Answer number one, they might not need to actually pay the penalty taxes because they
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:33.640]   might not need to actually make the distribution from the account.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.380]   Even though all the money or most of the money is in a tax-qualified account, they might
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.700]   not actually need to pay the taxes because they might not actually take the distribution
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.100]   even though they retired before 59.5.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.360]   And I'm going to give you some various scenarios to that.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.980]   Answer number two, they might just pay the penalty tax.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.260]   It might be cheaper to pay the penalty tax than to pay some other tax or other expense
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.180]   or other fee than the penalty tax.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.100]   And then we're just getting into what's the calculation.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:06.160]   Then number three and four are the well-known options to avoid the 10% penalty.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.820]   Option three is the Roth conversion option.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:15.820]   And then option four is the series of substantially equal periodic payments, also known as the
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.820]   72(t) rules.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.900]   So I'm going to cover three and four, which are the technical ones.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.900]   So let's start with number one.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.060]   How is it that somebody comes on my show and they have all their money in their 401(k)
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.340]   and they say, "But I'm going to retire at 35 years old."
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.340]   What?
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:34.020]   Well, here are a few ideas for you.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:41.060]   There could be many reasons why they may or may not actually take money out of the accounts
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.260]   that are going to be penalized.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:48.980]   And quick other caveat, I'm primarily today talking about avoiding the penalty, not so
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.780]   much talking about the income tax.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:56.420]   I'm primarily talking about the penalty tax, but the income tax will weave in.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:02.140]   So the first example that comes to mind for me is that most retirees, or at least early
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.340]   retirees that say they're going to stop and stop spending money, don't—excuse me, stop
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:11.300]   making money and thus start spending savings that they have, don't actually ever stop making
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.140]   money.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.180]   Or if they do, it's temporary.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.820]   The most recent example I would point to here is my friend Brandon, the mad scientist.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.820]   I've had him on the show.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.820]   He's back in the first 10 episodes.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.140]   He's going to give a great interview.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.460]   Brandon is a young guy.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.220]   He and his wife have been working on this early retirement plan.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.300]   They're retiring in their early 30s, and he's been working on it for a few years.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.780]   So his plan, he's hardcore.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.880]   I'm going to mention his site later as a great resource for you with really accessible
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.960]   articles on this.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.820]   But he's hardcore with retirement accounts.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.740]   Put everything in an IRA, put everything in a 401(k), defer everything, cut all your taxes
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.300]   across the board, and then pursue a Roth conversion strategy.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.740]   So he's super detailed with it.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.340]   He's awesome at it.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.340]   So he goes in.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.860]   He's working his plan, and I'll link to the article where he talks about this in his show—excuse
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.760]   me, in the show notes for today.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.380]   But he's working his plan, and he's planning to quit.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.460]   He was working at a university, so he could get a free master's degree there at the university,
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.300]   saving tons of money, not spending anything.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.420]   And he and his wife are planning to move to Scotland.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.900]   And so he goes in and he quits his job, per the plan.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.900]   He's financially independent.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.900]   He's hit his date.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.900]   He's gotten all the money.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.900]   He goes in and quits his job.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.220]   And a few days later, his employer gets in touch with him and says, "Brandon, no, listen,
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.220]   you were great.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.340]   You were really useful to us as an employee.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.100]   Would you be willing to keep on working for us, doing what you're doing from wherever
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.500]   in the world you want to do it?
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.660]   And in fact, we'll give you a 20% pay raise over and above what you were making."
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.840]   Huh.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.420]   So it seems like at least for now he's accepted it.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.900]   Now, will he do that for the rest of his life?
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.420]   I don't know, and he doesn't know either, I'm sure, unless—maybe it's six months,
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.420]   maybe it's six years.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   He's not at all.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   But the point is that this happens a lot of times.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.580]   And so people end up making more money after they declare themselves financially independent,
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.580]   early retired.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.580]   Now, some people don't, theoretically.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.740]   I haven't been able to find any of them or at least get them on the show.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.420]   We're having a thread in the Money Mustache forums where people are like, "Get someone
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.420]   who's lazy on the show."
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.100]   I'm like, "I can't find anybody who's lazy, who's willing to make the effort of coming
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.100]   on my show."
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.940]   But the point is, Brandon—so he's making 20% more, and even though he's got all this
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.620]   strategy of how do I get the money out, he's still making more money.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.940]   So he doesn't actually need the money.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.260]   So he declared himself financially independent, and yet he's still working.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.780]   Now, does this violate the whole idea?
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.500]   No, of course not.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.980]   It doesn't.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.140]   Because probably the biggest benefit to declaring yourself financially independent is psychological.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.900]   It changes your options.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.060]   You can do or not do anything you want, which is why even though I'm not in favor personally
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:40.100]   for me of never working again, I can't conceive of that being a desirable thing or a good
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:45.820]   thing or even something that I would ever even consider.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:50.540]   Yet it's one thing for me to say that from where I sit right now, not financially independent
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:56.500]   in my definition, versus if I were financially independent in my definition of it.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.620]   So you might still work and earn some money.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.780]   I haven't actually—I've hardly ever found anybody in the early retirement space who
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:07.500]   hasn't continued working and doing something else, whether that's the ones that are well-known
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.380]   today, you know, Money Mustache.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.500]   He's making more money now than he ever did in his life.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.500]   I guarantee it.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.820]   His blog is doing great.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.940]   He's got all his construction projects.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.260]   He could make more if he wanted to.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.420]   He's not that into it.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.980]   So the point was it's hugely valuable to be financially independent, but it doesn't mean
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.220]   you actually have to do it.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.780]   Jacob Fisker, same thing.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.020]   He's working, making money.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.660]   I've reached out to other older authors, actually, of other traditional books, and I have found
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.780]   that many of them, after they wrote their books some number of years later, they just
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.180]   went on and went back to work.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.740]   Now, does that mean everyone—no, of course not.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.740]   Not everyone does that.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.580]   I think Joe Dominguez, who wrote Your Money or Your Life, to the best of my knowledge,
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.420]   he spent the rest of his life volunteering, and he donated every dollar he made for the
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.060]   rest of his life.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:57.820]   Doug Nordman from the financial—what's the military site?
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.900]   Military Finance or something like that, whatever his site is called, he donates all of his
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.460]   money that he gets from his book and from his blogging to military charities, and he
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.060]   just lives off of his retirement savings.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.060]   So that's great.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.300]   But the point is, he could.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:18.340]   Now, another reason why you might not have the money coming out from a retirement account
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.420]   early even though you're declaring yourself financially independent is perhaps your spouse
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.420]   is working.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.020]   So the other example, to the best of my knowledge, Brandon is from Mad Scientist.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.100]   The plan is for he and his wife to move to Scotland, and I think that she is planning
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.220]   to continue working.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:36.820]   She's Scottish, and she's either an ophthalmologist or an optometrist doing something with eyes,
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.220]   and so the plan is for her to continue working.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:45.480]   And so very well, they could live on that income for a family and just keep the money
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.700]   in retirement accounts.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:52.020]   Same thing, Jacob Lundfisker, when he was writing Early Retirement Extreme, his wife
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.300]   was still working and earning money.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:59.180]   Now, how they handle that on tax planning doesn't matter to me, whether they handle
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.420]   their finances separately, whatever.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.460]   I don't understand why people in a marriage ever handle their finances separately, but
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.620]   live your life, do what you want.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:12.300]   I think it doesn't work for me, and I wouldn't do it, and I don't think – anyway, you'd
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   have to convince me.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.660]   I've never found the argument that's convinced me, but if you want to do it, fine.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.580]   But so for me, if I chose and declared myself financially independent, if my spouse were
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:26.340]   working or vice versa, then we're financially independent because we have the money in the
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.340]   retirement accounts.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.200]   It doesn't mean we actually pull it out, and that's fine.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.700]   You might do something like – another option, you might wind up getting an inheritance.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.420]   Maybe your parents die and leave you money.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.780]   Maybe your Uncle Joe dies and leaves you money.
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:44.780]   It happens, and there's no reason then in that situation not to spend it and keep the
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.060]   money in the retirement accounts.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.220]   You might do something like using other assets.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   So you might have something like a house, and you might sell the house.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.940]   And so for many people, maybe all of their assets are in a house and a 401(k).
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.460]   That doesn't mean they can't retire early.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.020]   It just means they'll probably be selling the house and spending those proceeds or selling
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.020]   the house and buying a rental house instead and living on that money.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:10.140]   You might have other accounts, or the early retirees might have other accounts that are
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:17.140]   deferred but that have less restrictive rules about 59.5 than an IRA or a 401(k).
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:23.020]   So the examples that quickly come to mind are deferred comp programs including a 457
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.020]   plan.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:30.140]   When I was at Northwestern Mutual, I had several retirement accounts and various accounts available
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.140]   to me.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:36.820]   I had two different pensions that I was eligible to based upon different calculations and formulas,
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.900]   and I also had two different deferred compensation programs that were available to me.
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:46.060]   I had a short-term deferred compensation program and a long-term deferred compensation program.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.140]   And basically, it's super simple.
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:53.300]   I could just tell Northwestern, "Defer this amount of my income based upon this formula
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.080]   into this specific year."
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:01.740]   So I always plan to use this in my life as part of my—basically to fund my plan of
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.180]   taking sabbaticals or distributed retirement throughout my life.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:11.340]   I've had the idea of how I would prefer to work, to work in chunks.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.500]   So each year, I've been working towards—I haven't hit this every year, but for the last
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.660]   five years, I've been working to try to work in essentially three-month chunks of time.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.560]   So my plan was always to work January, February, March, take April off, work May, June, July,
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.860]   take August off, work September, October, November, and then take December off.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.140]   And I like that from the perspective of it gives me the time to tackle major projects,
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.060]   and I would wind up working 75% of the time.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.100]   And based upon how I like to work, I think that I would actually get more done in that
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:47.660]   really focused time and then having the time off on the—of every fourth month.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.220]   And I could distribute that into projects.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.260]   It would work well with my family.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.500]   We could take month-long trips, which to me is an ideal length of time.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:00.880]   It's long enough to feel like I don't have to fit into this silly six-day vacation weird
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.060]   thing that we US Americans do.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.940]   But it's also not quite as big of a deal as setting your life up so that you can leave
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.180]   for six months.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.300]   So that's how I've—even I've approached it for the last few years.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.900]   I haven't hit it every year as organized as I would like, but I've always been able to
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.300]   take at least a month off, often closer to two, depending on how I structured it, every
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.340]   year for the last basically five years.
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.900]   And I work harder during the time that I'm here than take my time off.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.660]   I also have had the plan of doing sabbaticals.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.340]   I never wanted to do this when it was just me.
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.020]   And at this stage with a young son, I don't want to do this.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:39.860]   But as my son and hopefully—we're hoping to have more kids, then hopefully more kids
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.180]   get a little bit older, then I plan to take sabbaticals.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:46.240]   I want to take a year off or maybe two years off or a year and a half off.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.060]   So I could use something like my deferred compensation programs—and this was actually
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:56.660]   my plan—was to basically just defer 20% of my earnings into this account.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.300]   And then every fifth year I'd have one year of income sitting there waiting for me.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.780]   Now from a tax perspective, this was purely a deferred compensation program with no age
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.880]   59 and a half restrictions.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:12.260]   And so I could keep the money there, and every fifth year I would have the same amount of
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.940]   income that I had in years one through four.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:20.580]   So this was my plan of to use that specific plan to cover myself.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.340]   So these programs do still exist.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:29.140]   They're uncommon with small employers, which is why most people don't even think about
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.140]   this.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.500]   We just think 401(k), 401(k), but they're very doable.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.300]   Usually it's going to be with either a larger employer or it's going to be an executive
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   benefit.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.900]   So if you're an executive at a large firm, you're going to have access to something like
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.100]   this or at least it's going to be something that you're going to be talked about.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.020]   This is an area of financial planning that is pretty niche.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.940]   Most people aren't familiar with it, but you can set these types of deferred comp plans
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.980]   up.
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:57.740]   Or the most common one would be a 457, which is a deferred compensation plan for government
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.300]   employees and also for nonprofit employees, essentially.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.900]   There's differences between the governmental ones and the non-governmental ones.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:08.380]   But basically it just allows you to defer some income into this plan and you could take
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.060]   it out, but there's no, without the age 59 and a half restriction.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.780]   I'm dramatically simplifying, but that's basically how it works.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.540]   So if somebody has a 457 plan, if you're a teacher and you have access to a 457 plan,
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:22.780]   or if you're a police officer and you have access to a 457 plan, you can use this to
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.300]   defer the tax now and pay it in the future without dealing with the age 59 and a half
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.700]   scenario.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.860]   You might just have something like a taxable account, a cash savings account, or you might
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:37.740]   do something like your, maybe, a scenario that I can think of where you would even,
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.180]   you declare yourself financially independent even with a bunch of money in retirement accounts
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:48.140]   would be, because you can tap the equity on your house and use that to fund your lifestyle.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.660]   And many people can do this.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.300]   And the key is that usually with early retirees, most of the people who are planning this early
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:59.940]   retiree path, their expenses are so low compared to their assets that it's relatively simple
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.480]   to find some money from somewhere else.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.540]   So you could combine these plans.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.620]   So you could, for example, you turn 50 years old and you're trying to get yourself from
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:14.500]   50 to 60 and you have a big house, fancy house, well paid for.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.020]   You don't need that much money, but you want to stay in the house for five years.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.140]   Well, you take the equity out with a home equity loan for the first five years.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.380]   Then at 55, you sell the house and you spend down some of the proceeds from that from 55
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.220]   to 60 and then you start tapping retirement accounts.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.480]   Depends on your scenario.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.580]   You might have something like a life insurance policy.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.060]   With Northwestern Mutual, Northwestern, we did a lot of cash value life insurance.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.380]   And so that was always something that oftentimes I would come across a client who has this
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.840]   really awesome, mature, well-funded life insurance policy.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.980]   So a lot of times when you're doing retirement planning, that's a pool of money that we can
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.060]   pool from.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.720]   And if their dad bought it for them and this thing is crazy mature and we've got all these
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.500]   dividends that we could take out tax-free up to the basis, or maybe we could take out
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:05.220]   a loan against it to fund as a funding mechanism to bridge from one account to another.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.980]   Just depends on the makeup of the person.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.980]   So that would be one example.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.580]   They might not need to pay the penalty tax because they don't actually have to take the
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.020]   distributions because there's other money.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.420]   They might be moving to a different country and earning money in a different country.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:25.180]   So you still have the US taxes, but now you're working in Spain or working in Australia,
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.000]   having fun, making a living.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.380]   So the money just sits in the retirement account in the US and what gave you the guts to do
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.380]   it was the fact that you didn't need the money, you didn't need to pull the money out.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.860]   Some people might work on the black market.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.860]   Whether that means going around and picking up scrap metal because you think that's fun
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.740]   or whether that means making birdhouses in your garage and selling that for a couple
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.540]   thousand bucks a month or coding on the internet and just making your money in Bitcoin or something
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.540]   like that.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.060]   Some people might, because they're financially independent, might just work on the black
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.820]   market and evade the taxes.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.380]   Some people might, for example, barter for housing.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.060]   So let's say that I like agriculture.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.060]   Well, I could easily have a bunch of money in retirement accounts and I want to go out
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:11.500]   and do slow travel around the world, but I just choose to work on wolfing farms, worldwide
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:17.380]   opportunities on organic farms, and I choose to work for my living where I lower my lifestyle,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.980]   my cost for my lifestyle, so I don't need to take money out of the retirement account.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.660]   You could keep the house and rent your own house out while you slow travel.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:29.700]   And for some people, you have a nice fancy house in a desirable place, you can rent that
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.180]   thing out for two, three thousand bucks a month and that's more than some people will
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.500]   spend traveling the world.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:40.620]   Or two, three thousand bucks for that plus a severance package or something like that.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.300]   That's a lot of money for some people.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.180]   And then you might just start a new business that you love with the freedom that you have.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:53.060]   So again, prove to me that you can show me an early retiree that completely quits.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.060]   Now I found a few of them online.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.540]   I just haven't been able to get anybody to come on the show because the ones who are
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:01.700]   actually lazy are too lazy to come on my show, which is fine.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.700]   Good for them.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.140]   That's awesome.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:08.380]   So in many cases, financial independence or early retirement might just be the mental
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.340]   freedom knowing that I don't have to work if I don't want to and that can be worth it.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.500]   It really can be.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.620]   So that's answer one is maybe they're just not actually taking a distribution.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.820]   Now that's not probably why you tuned into the show, but I do want to start there because
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.180]   that is what happens.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.860]   That's actually what happens.
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:28.020]   Now option two is you might just choose to take the distribution from the retirement
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.580]   account and pay the penalty tax because it's cheaper than something else.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.540]   Oftentimes with tax planning, what we wind up doing is paying one tax in order to avoid
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.220]   another more expensive tax.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:43.220]   The example that would come to mind off the bat is probably the simplest example would
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:49.780]   be the penalty tax if you don't take your required minimum distributions off of a 401(k)
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.980]   or off of a qualified retirement account.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.860]   So you reach age 70 and a half and you have money in a 401(k), the IRS requires you to
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.060]   take required minimum distributions from that account.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.860]   There's a formula that it's based upon, but there are many people who reach that point
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.300]   in time and they say, "I don't need this money.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.660]   I want to keep the money in the account because if I take it out, I'm going to have to pay
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.300]   the income tax on it."
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:15.620]   The problem is that if you don't take your required minimum distributions, then you are
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:20.260]   taxed at 50% of what the required minimum distributions would have been.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.800]   So you pay a 50% penalty tax.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   That's a lot of money.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.700]   There's almost nobody that has a tax rate in excess of 50% on retirement distributions.
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:35.140]   So basically you choose to take the money out at say perhaps a 20% rate and pay the
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:42.700]   20% income tax now so as to avoid the 50% penalty tax on your required minimum distributions.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.740]   Now it could be the other way around.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:51.900]   You might choose to put the money into a retirement account and then take it out to avoid a 20%
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.820]   income tax and then take it out knowing that you're only going to take it out when you're
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.100]   paying a 10% penalty tax.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.380]   And so therefore paying the 10% penalty tax could conceivably be cheaper.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.380]   And there are various reasons why it could be cheaper.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.200]   It could be cheaper because it allows you to actually take advantage of something like
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.100]   an employer match or it could be cheaper just because you've changed what your individual
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.620]   tax rates and tax base and tax rates are.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.460]   So if you had something, I'll make an example.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.820]   Let's say that your employer matches you dollar for dollar into a 401(k) up to let's just
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.240]   make it generous $5,000.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:32.740]   So if you contribute $5,000 of your money to the 401(k) and if your employer contributes
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.900]   $5,000 of their money to the 401(k), then in that situation you put in five and you
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.100]   get ten.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.860]   Now you've avoided the income taxes.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.740]   You're going to be taxed on that later when you pull it out.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.700]   But if you take it out, you're going to have to pay the 10% penalty tax.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.700]   Well let's run the math.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.940]   So $5,000 plus $5,000 equals $10,000.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:58.820]   Now regardless, you're going to have to pay the income tax if we take it out early and
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.820]   we don't avoid that.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.620]   So I'm keeping it purely apples to apples.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:06.820]   Now assume you're going to pay a 20% income tax either on the $5,000 that you go ahead
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:13.140]   and take the income or on the $5,000 that you defer into the 401(k) to get the match.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.980]   So in your head, you know that you're either going to go ahead and get $4,000 to spend
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.140]   now or you're going to get $8,000 to spend later.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:26.580]   So let's say that you go ahead and you put your $5,000 into the account.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.660]   The employer puts their $5,000 into the account.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.940]   You're going to pay $2,000 of income tax when you take it out.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.020]   But you're going to pay a 10% penalty tax on the $10,000.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.380]   Well that would be a $1,000 penalty tax.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:45.260]   So now the question is would I rather go ahead and take the $4,000 this year in my paycheck
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:51.100]   and give up the employer match or would I rather go ahead and put that – it was $5,000
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.900]   and you paid $1,000 of tax now to get $4,000 in the paycheck.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.740]   Or would I rather go ahead and put the $5,000 into the 401(k).
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:05.060]   They put their $5,000 in the 401(k) and assuming I'm vested – going based on a vesting
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.820]   schedule – assuming I'm vested in their contribution, next year I leave and I take
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.420]   all $10,000 out of the 401(k).
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:18.620]   I pay $2,000 of income tax and $1,000 of penalty tax which leaves me with $7,000.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.780]   That's a net gain.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.620]   So, you might just say, "Well, this is 10%.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.620]   I got to pay it."
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.900]   So, that could be very rational.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.900]   Now it could also be rational because you know of something that's going to happen
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.340]   where you're actually going to change your scenario.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.780]   So what comes to mind here is let's say that you're going to change states.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.020]   Maybe you're working in a state where you have very high state income tax or even a
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.940]   local city income tax.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.980]   So, if you think of something like New York City and New York State, New York State income
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.920]   taxes vary depending on what the brackets are.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.260]   But around – let's see.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:56.700]   So, I'm looking at tax-rates.org.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:04.380]   So around $154,350 of income for a couple, you get into a 6.65% marginal bracket.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:10.100]   So ignoring deductions and credits, every dollar you earn that's in excess of $155,000,
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:17.020]   you're going to pay 6.65% of income tax on that money.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.260]   Now if you go to the New York City rates, well, let's see.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:24.220]   So New York City rates look like they range from about 3 to 3.5%.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:28.540]   So let's say as an example that you have 3 to 3.5%.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.540]   Let's use 3.5%.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.180]   That will make it line up well with the 6.5%.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.660]   So now if you have 3.5 plus 6.5, you have 10% income taxes.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:41.100]   So what's the harm of just putting the money into the 401(k) and then moving to Florida
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.500]   when you quit your job and taking the money out of the 401(k)?
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.260]   You paid 10% up there and you paid 10% down here of taking it out early.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.500]   Now the trick would have been in that situation you can exploit probably an income bracket.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.780]   So let's say you go from $300,000 of household income to living on only needing $3,000 a
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.700]   month because you're doing an early retirement thing and you were saving 90% of your income.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.300]   Well in that situation it's pretty simple.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.340]   You're not going to pay that much bracket and you're going to have zero income taxes.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:13.740]   So you go from maybe an effective rate of 40% up there to an effective rate of 10% in
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.580]   Florida because you're just paying the 10% penalty and you're paying 0% state income
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:25.460]   taxes and 0% in federal income taxes because you lowered your income needs.
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:29.300]   That might be a good reason just to go ahead and pay it.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.660]   Another example would be California.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:39.660]   In California, let's see, again, tax-rates.org, excess couples, in excess of $415,000 of income,
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.300]   the marginal bracket is 11.3%.
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.900]   That goes up to 13.3% in excess of a million of income.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.720]   So you've got an 11% state tax bracket.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.260]   If you just simply moved from California to Florida and then took all of your money out
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:58.780]   of the account, that theoretically could save you 11.3%.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:03.340]   Now does this actually work in practicality?
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:08.660]   No not in that specific way because the brackets, we're talking about a marginal bracket, it's
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.800]   not quite that neat but it's pretty much the concept.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.920]   Now when you combine this with the income tax bracket from going with a lower number,
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   this is the other one.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.700]   So the two big changes, you might change states from a state that charges income taxes to
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:26.140]   a state that doesn't or you might also change where you are in the bracket, what your marginal
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.460]   bracket is.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:32.300]   So if you went from earning $200,000 a year and you're living an early retiree lifestyle
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:37.700]   and living on $3,000 a month, $36,000 a year, and then you just went and you started taking
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:42.220]   off the money at $36,000 a year, you're going to be paying a much lower, even though it's
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.300]   coming from retirement accounts, you're going to be paying a much lower income tax bracket
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.180]   at that money even if you were paying the penalty.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.420]   Now you actually have to calculate your specific scenario but this can make a big difference.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.780]   Could you go from a 30% marginal bracket to a 0% marginal bracket?
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:05.740]   If so then paying 10% instead of 30, paying a 10% penalty instead of the 30% bracket would
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.780]   be worth it.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.940]   So you have to start with looking at your actual scenario, looking at your actual taxes,
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.540]   your actual rates, the base, the rates in your situation, and then looking at what your
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.940]   options would be and also what your plans would be.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.020]   If you're never going to move from New York City to Florida, don't.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.220]   Don't do that plan.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.780]   But I can tell you that's one of the big reasons why we have a gazillion New Yorkers down here.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.660]   And if you're never going to move from California, don't do that plan.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.660]   That's not going to work.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.820]   You're going to need to do something else.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.100]   But that is one scenario.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.260]   So you might be in a lower bracket, you might move to another state, and the other thing
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.300]   is the tax might not be a big deal because it's just doing it for a few years.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:46.100]   So maybe, and this is often I think also what happens, is that people are going to retire
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.380]   before 59.5 but they just need money for a few years.
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.860]   So maybe you're retiring at 50.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.700]   Well, if you have a ton of money in investments, maybe by then your investments are growing
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:59.380]   by so much that it's far in excess of the 10% you're going to pay to get the money from
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.380]   50 to 59.5 and then you're going to take the money out.
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.380]   Big deal.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.420]   So is that mathematically perfect?
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.420]   No.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.980]   But we don't have a crystal ball to know exactly what all of your lifetime plans are when we're
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.900]   sitting down at 22 years old and making out plans.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.100]   So hopefully that's a good intro.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.020]   Now we're going to get to the two technical things.
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:20.940]   And I'm not going to actually spend a long time, but I wanted to make you aware of those.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:24.580]   Answer one, meaning answer that they don't actually take the distributions, that's one
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.180]   answer to the question of how do the early retirees do.
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.020]   Answer two is they might just pay the penalty tax.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:35.740]   But most of the people in the early retiree plan are planning on options three or four.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:43.060]   Option three is called the Roth conversion and option four is a series of substantially
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.540]   equal periodic payments.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.260]   72T is what it is.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.660]   So let's do the Roth conversion.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.100]   Here's basically the principle behind it without any technical talk.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:57.940]   When you participate in a Roth IRA, you can always take your contributions to the account
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:04.420]   out again without any tax implications one way or the other of any kind.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:12.140]   So if you this year put $5,000 into a Roth IRA and next year you take $5,000 out, regardless
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:21.500]   of your age, there are no tax issues whatsoever with that decision, which is why when you're
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:27.020]   young this can be a really great move to do is that you fund the Roth IRA and you put
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.900]   your $5,000 in there.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.780]   And even if you just kept the money in cash, you can use it as an emergency fund.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.020]   It's no big deal.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:38.500]   Now you have to avoid any kind of penalties or fees that would be imposed by an investment
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.500]   company.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.940]   So let's say that if you were buying loaded mutual funds where you're paying a commission,
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.580]   you wouldn't get that money out.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:49.220]   Or if you are paying where there's some sort of fee involved, you have to avoid that if
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:50.220]   you're going to do this plan.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:54.780]   But you could do that at a bank with probably no fee and just toss the $5,000 in there.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.020]   So I would always just use the Roth IRA as just a straight account because you can always
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.500]   take the money out.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:07.620]   Now if you contribute $5,000 to the Roth IRA and next year you take out $5,001, well the
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.820]   $5,000 comes to you with no tax implications.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:18.420]   But the $1 of gain will be taxed to you and it might be penalized unless you can avoid
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:23.060]   one of the exceptions.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.660]   So that's one of the keys.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:29.180]   So essentially what this opens up for people is – and by the way, sorry, here's the
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:34.500]   other key – is that on that basis, as long as the money that's in a Roth IRA stays
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.220]   there for – excuse me, I'm getting tongue-tied here.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.820]   So when you put money directly into a Roth IRA, the rules that I just said apply.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:51.060]   However, you can also do this by converting a traditional IRA or a traditional 401(k)
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.140]   to a Roth IRA.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:59.380]   So the example would be, let's say I have $100,000 in my traditional 401(k) and I convert
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.900]   that to a Roth IRA.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:08.120]   Now in the year that I convert it, I'm going to pay the income tax on the money.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.580]   So I convert it and I pay the income tax.
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:17.020]   Now as long as I leave the money alone for five years and then I only take out the amount
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:22.940]   that I converted, I can take out that amount that I converted after five years without
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.320]   paying the penalty tax.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:30.580]   So this is the plan that most of the people that are in this scenario are working on.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:35.740]   So I have $1 million in 401(k)s and this is called a Roth conversion ladder.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:42.460]   So I have $1 million in 401(k)s and assume that I need $10,000 from my portfolio to support
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.240]   my other forms of income so that I can be financially independent.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.520]   So this year I convert $10,000 from my 401(k) to a Roth IRA.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.320]   I bring that income forward, because remember this is just a timing strategy, an income
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.080]   time shifting strategy.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.840]   I go ahead and pay that tax on the $10,000 now if there is any.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:06.080]   Then five years from now I take that $10,000 out of the Roth IRA and I spend it.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.640]   Now in the meantime it may have actually grown.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.920]   So it may have grown from $10,000 to $12,000, which is great.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:18.800]   I still just take my $10,000 out and I leave the $2,000 to grow until after 59 and a half.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.960]   Or I take it out and pay the penalties on the $2,000 if it's not for one of the other
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.560]   exceptions.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.560]   So that's it.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.080]   So that's what many people are doing.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.500]   Pile up a bunch of money in 401(k)s, cover yourself for five years through other sources
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.880]   of income, and then transition and transfer the money from the traditional 401(k) to a
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.640]   Roth IRA and then start taking it out.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.960]   It's called a Roth conversion ladder.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   And it's great.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.520]   There's no reason why it can't work.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.920]   If you're interested in this strategy, I just explained to you everything you need
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:54.400]   to know as far as the basics of it, how it works so you can understand it.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.820]   Now there are some tweaks that you can do and some of the tweaks are pretty cool.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.880]   So one of the useful things, the two most accessible resources that I would send you
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:09.960]   to is our Brandon@MadFientist.com and then Jeremy and Winnie@GoCurryCracker.com.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:15.960]   The reason they're accessible is they're normal people and they don't write in financial
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.960]   planner speak.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.680]   I think you need to learn – it would probably be a good idea if you read the financial planner
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:27.360]   speak but it's hard for people who are not used to financial planner speak to get it.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.080]   And Brandon and Jeremy, because they're normal people, they write in normal language.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.080]   So start there.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.240]   Now then go from there.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.800]   Go to the financial planner stuff and make sure you get the rules.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   But they do everything.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.360]   They talk about everything that you need to know.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.560]   They're normal guys.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.720]   And so start there.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.800]   Now the problem with – I mean here's the advantage and disadvantage and here's why
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   many of the early retirees are doing it.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:53.480]   In order to retire early, you have to learn to live on a much smaller percentage of your
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.520]   income than most other people.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.120]   Does that mean you're used to living a good life on not much money?
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.920]   Now that means you're willing to continue it also on not much money in retirement.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.280]   And so the crazy thing is our tax code penalizes productivity.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:13.520]   So as long as you can suit your lifestyle to not much money, then you can escape the
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.520]   tax code.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   It's crazy.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.520]   Excuse me.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.160]   To me, I understand but I don't understand.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:23.200]   I think it's stupid how our tax code is set up where it completely penalizes any kind
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.460]   of productivity and the more productive you are, the more it penalizes you.
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.600]   So some people just ignore it and press through and a lot of people say, "This is stupid.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.740]   Why should I do it?"
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:38.280]   So if you can be a slacker and just simply stop being productive, you can stop paying
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   taxes.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.600]   Go read Jeremy's articles on that.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.640]   I interviewed him on the show as well, previous episode.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.440]   Go look through the archives and see Jeremy from Go Curry Cracker.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.400]   He publishes his tax returns online, pays no taxes and lives a slacker lifestyle, which
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   is awesome.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   Good for him.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:56.280]   I just think it's a sheer and utter total waste of talent to have very smart people
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.080]   like Brandon and Jeremy spending their life energy avoiding taxes.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:05.840]   It's even worse to have a whole army of financial planners expending our life energy to help
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.400]   people avoid taxes.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.000]   I do not get it.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   It frustrates me.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.060]   I have a difficult time having political conversations about taxes with people because I understand.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.120]   Look at the incentives.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.800]   Look at the facts.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.440]   Look at how just stupid all of the laws are as far as when they're put together.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:27.560]   Don't you realize that people with money have plenty of money to hire guys like me
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.520]   and guys ten times smarter than me and more well-read than me and gals 20 times smarter
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:36.000]   than all of us to find the loopholes and exploit them?
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.800]   If you're making $3 million a year, a 2% savings on your taxes, that's big money.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.840]   Now, if you're making $30,000 a year, that's not a big money, but 2% savings, that's
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.760]   $60,000 if you're making $3 million a year.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.640]   So you have this whole stupid tax code.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.880]   It's all cobbled together with this and that and this and that and this and that.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.120]   And you got to, anyway, rant over.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.000]   But it's just utterly stupid.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.240]   I hate spending my life energy helping people avoid taxes, and I think it's despicable
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.640]   that we're taking some of the smartest people, incredible guys, and it's like, "Why should
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:13.200]   I bother to work and pay taxes?"
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.000]   It's just dumb.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   So go look at how Brandon and Jeremy are talking about it, and you'll understand the Roth
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.840]   conversion scenario.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.200]   And there's some good stuff.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.280]   So the key is here, you have to actually understand how much you're going to spend.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.600]   And this only works, this strategy only works well.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.960]   It works okay, but it only works well if you're going to be spending a much lower amount of
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:42.160]   money than most other people because all the tax breaks in our tax code are for the poor.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:47.320]   So if you can just simply not make much money, then you can be poor and you can not pay any
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   taxes.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   I'm intentionally not giving you a lot more detail than that because you need to research
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.980]   this for yourself.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.840]   And so start with Brandon and Jeremy's, and then from there, go to the IRS website is
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.700]   what I would do and start reading their stuff.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:05.760]   If you can deal with IRS-speak or financial planner-speak, that would be a good place
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.760]   to go.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.260]   My hope is that you'll research it.
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.720]   And I love the early retirement scenario.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:15.040]   One of the things that's so frustrating, and the reason why, one of the things that's frustrating
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.400]   about traditional financial advice is if I tell a traditional person sitting in my office,
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.200]   just lower your expenses to $3,000 a month, people look at me like I have two heads.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.280]   The standard answer when you're a financial planner, if you ask somebody who's making
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.200]   $6,000 a month how much they want to retire on, they say $10,000 a month.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.000]   And you say, "Are you kidding me?
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.680]   Do you not get this?"
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.080]   But that's the standard answer.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.880]   Now in the early retirement space, the cool thing is if you ask somebody making $10,000
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.840]   a month how much they want to retire on, they say $2,000 a month.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.840]   So it's pretty cool.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.720]   This works really well in the early retirement space.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.200]   I hope that helps.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   Read the articles.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.280]   Pay special attention to the tax rates on dividends and capital gains.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.600]   You can do fancy stuff.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.920]   Like Brandon has a great article on what he calls the Roth IRA horse race, which is a
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.320]   cool little technique.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.040]   Basically at the beginning of every year, you convert two accounts.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.200]   You invest one in stocks, one in bonds.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.920]   Whichever one comes out better at the end of the year, you keep.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:15.840]   And the other one, you recharacterize and undo that conversion and then flip it back
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.320]   before the end of the year.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.320]   It's a cool strategy.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.320]   Read that.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.720]   You can do cool stuff like front-loading your accounts at the beginning of the year and
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.080]   seeing what ends up being better.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.160]   There's all kinds of stuff, but I don't want to go any deeper than today.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.920]   So hopefully that helps you to understand the Roth conversion ladder.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:38.360]   Option number four is often referred to as the 72(t) distribution.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:44.960]   You'll see it as 72(t) or SEPP, which stands for substantially equal periodic payments
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.160]   or often I'll refer to it as a series of substantially equal periodic payments.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.520]   So basically this is one of the exceptions to paying the penalty tax.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:59.120]   And so 72(t), section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code is where you find all of the
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.480]   exceptions to paying the penalty tax.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:06.960]   And one of those exceptions is that the 10% additional penalty tax will not apply to a
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:12.960]   distribution which is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.160]   Now how is that defined?
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.160]   Well, it has to be defined in this way.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.880]   Number one, these payments cannot be paid any less frequently than annually.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:25.680]   So that's IRS speak for saying it's got to be at least once a year.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:34.480]   Number two, those payments must be paid without changing the amount until the longer of five
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.100]   years or until you reach age 59 and a half.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:45.400]   So if I'm 30 and I do this, I cannot change the amount coming from the account until at
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.420]   least 59 and a half.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.440]   If you do this at 57, you have to go for at least five years.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:56.640]   So it has to be paid to you without changing the amount of the payment for at least for
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:02.120]   the longer of five years or until the payee reaches age 59 and a half.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:09.320]   Next, the distribution has to be based upon the life expectancy of the recipient or the
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.440]   recipient and their beneficiary.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.720]   So it has to be paid to you based upon your actual life expectancy.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.120]   And this is the big problem.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.680]   It has to be based upon a reasonable rate of interest.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.760]   And if applicable, it has to be based upon reasonable mortality assumptions.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.480]   Here's the key.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:33.400]   Once you start taking payments, those payments may not be changed.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.880]   They may not be increased.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.280]   They may not be decreased.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:43.640]   They may not be changed in any way before the age of 59 and a half or the end of five
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.320]   years, whichever of those is longer.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.880]   Make sense?
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:55.920]   If the payments are modified in any way, then the 10% penalty tax is applied retroactively
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.640]   to all payments that are received before 59 and a half.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   That's a big deal.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.700]   That's a huge deal.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:10.760]   If you change the amount at any age, then the 10% penalty tax has to be paid retroactively.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.840]   Now if I do this at age 30, I'm probably going to know that.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:16.680]   But what happens is sometimes somebody will do this at 52.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.640]   And let's say they set up a series of payments at 52, and then at 58 they change something.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.160]   Because they're like, "I'm almost 59 and a half," and they change the amount somehow.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:32.080]   And if they do that, then they're sunk because then the payments have to actually – they
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.440]   pay the 10% penalty tax on all the money they receive from 52 to 58.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:42.440]   And the only exception to that is that there is an option one time where they can switch
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.280]   from what's called the annuity method or the amortization method to the required minimum
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.120]   distribution method without paying a penalty.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:54.000]   But what that does is it greatly decreases the payout amounts.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   And so that could actually help keep the funds for longer, but it reduces the payout amounts,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.400]   which usually isn't the goal for early retirees.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:08.600]   Which is – incidentally, this is one of the reasons why this Section 72(t) – and
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.080]   I'm going to give you some example numbers here in a minute as we wrap up.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.800]   But this is why 72(t) is not really of help for most people.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:20.560]   I had a scenario in my practice where I had a client, a wonderful client, and this client
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.720]   came to me and they had a lot of money in their 401(k).
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.800]   And when they had a lot of money in their 401(k), they were doing well, the money got
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.960]   rolled over to my stewardship.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.600]   And while it was under my stewardship, the client was doing fine.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:40.280]   They had gotten laid off from a job, but they were receiving – what's that called when
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.280]   they pay you money?
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.280]   Unemployment.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:47.440]   They were receiving unemployment, and they were just enjoying their unemployment income.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.640]   They weren't looking for work, and they were just enjoying their unemployment.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:56.080]   This was in the time in 2000-whatever, late 2000s, when it was extended, when they kept
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.680]   extending the unemployment, extending the unemployment.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:02.320]   The client was traveling and just not living a big lifestyle, but just enjoying the unemployment.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.520]   So then – and then had some other savings, and then finally the unemployment ran out
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.600]   after what, it was 99 weeks, I think.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.480]   So finally the unemployment ran out.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.720]   So they just started to think about getting a job.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.520]   So they went and started getting a job and started looking around and trying to figure
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.200]   out, "Well, what do I do?"
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.720]   They looked at a few different places and couldn't find a job.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.600]   And then they started taking distributions from the retirement accounts.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:30.240]   It started off as small, and it got bigger, and it got bigger, and it was bigger, it was
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.280]   one, and then four months later it was another, and then it was $10,000, and then it was $40,000,
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   et cetera.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.560]   And this retirement account goes down, down, down, down, down.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.960]   The problem was the retirement account – this client was about 50 – but the retirement
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.900]   account – no, no, excuse me, late 40s – wasn't enough to get them through retirement even.
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:50.960]   So they said, "Is there any exception?"
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:57.760]   But we go through 72(t), and 72(t) didn't work because they didn't even have enough
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   money for retirement.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.120]   So the whole time though they insisted they were going to get a job.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.380]   If they're going to get a job, they're going to get a job.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:07.720]   So I said, "Listen, you could start 72(t), but the problem is the payments are not enough
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.840]   to fund your whole lifestyle, and if you start at 72(t) you can't change it."
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.440]   Well, the whole point was they needed to go back to work, and they said they were going
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.440]   to.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:19.120]   So it just wound up being a tough situation all around, and it was a massive problem.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.280]   So 72(t) didn't help.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:25.480]   Looking back in retrospect, if I could have predicted what would have happened, then I
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.480]   should have.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.080]   And that's one of those things where with more maybe wisdom of hindsight, maybe next
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.520]   time if a client is the type of client who doesn't work for two years because they're
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.040]   taking unemployment, and then I should have maybe predicted.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.880]   But I didn't know they were going to be out of work for five years, and so 72(t) didn't
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.880]   work.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.520]   So they had paid the 10% penalty tax.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:51.040]   So this is just an example, and the key is you have to actually review the rules and
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.540]   figure out what works in your situation.
[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:58.120]   Let me give you one calculation, and then I'm done here for today, except I want to
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:02.700]   actually talk about one problem or consideration with these approaches.
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:08.120]   So if you actually look at the numbers, and the easiest way to look at the numbers is
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.000]   to just use an online calculator.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.400]   I'll put one from Dinkytown here in the show notes that I pulled up.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.320]   This is easier than calculating by hand.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.600]   And it'll compare the three different amounts, and you can put in your account balance, the
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   interest rate.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.000]   It'll stick that in for your age and the beneficiary's age.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.220]   And then you can choose whether you want to do a single life expectancy or a joint life
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.440]   expectancy or the uniform table.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.320]   So if I put in here, let's say that I now am, and it starts at 35, so I can't do it
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.440]   at 30, but let's say I'm a year old, and I put in here that I'm 35 and my beneficiary
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.560]   is 35, and I calculate this on a million-dollar portfolio.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.520]   This million-dollar portfolio, basically I could get somewhere about $34,000 per year
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.920]   out of this account.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:55.200]   So in my scenario, if I were 35 years old and I had a million dollars invested, and
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:01.400]   I wanted to take out 3.5% every year, which would effectively be what $34,000 would be,
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:08.000]   I could use this to actually fund my lifestyle and never have to pay the 10% penalty tax.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.320]   I would pay the income tax, but I'd never have to pay the 10% penalty tax if I did that.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.400]   Now the problem would be that I can't stop it.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:20.240]   So if at 39 I change my mind and I go back to work, I can't stop this money, otherwise
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.500]   I have to go back and pay the 10% tax retroactively.
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:29.440]   So this is the kind of thing that it could be applicable to an early retirement situation,
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.480]   but it's probably not.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.520]   You have to have enough money, and an early retiree scenario could do it because they
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:37.040]   have enough money, but it's probably not because you can't change it.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:43.800]   And for me to go from 35 to 60, 59.5, 60, that's 25 years that I've got to predict
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.360]   and I can't stop the money.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:48.740]   Now if I'm okay with just keeping the money coming in and getting it out, that's fine.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:52.360]   And so for some people who are trying to say, "I need to cash out my 401(k)," that can
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.880]   work and that can be fine, but you've got to consider it and count the cost.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:01.720]   So those are the four basic options, and depending on an individual situation, many people will
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.880]   choose among those options.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.780]   Now I want to close with one of these problems.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.920]   One problem for you to consider.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.320]   Could the laws change?
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:15.000]   This is something I rarely see discussed in the early retirement space, but it's a concern
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.640]   of mine.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.960]   Could the laws change?
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:25.800]   One thing I've—I haven't gone back and searched all the legislative history, but I do know
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   this.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.800]   Laws change.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.760]   And I have an example here that to me is a good example.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.080]   I'm going to cover in just a second.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.320]   But it's very tough for me to trust the government.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:39.640]   It's very tough for me because the legislators who are designing the law are going to be
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.680]   swayed by the court of public opinion.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   And it's very hard for me sometimes to figure out why certain things are done.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:53.360]   So for example, you could hear the traditional mainstream tax perspective of financial planning—excuse
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:59.080]   me, of tax law—would say that the reason that the government gives you a tax incentive
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:04.000]   for you to set your money aside until at least the age of 59 and a half is because it's in
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.440]   the social good and it's in the common good for all of us to care for ourselves for retirement.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.560]   So there's going to be a motivation for you to set your money aside.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.720]   Well, it might be a motivation if you just stop taxing people on earning money, but set
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.720]   that aside.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.940]   So that might be a motivation.
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:25.660]   Now you could flip it around and say, "Well, is there another reason for this?
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:29.480]   Is there a motivation for you to keep your money locked up, for example, to keep you
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.980]   as indentured or enslaved to the working system?
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:39.160]   Because if you can't get your money out easily, then now you're forced to keep working."
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.160]   What's the answer?
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.160]   I don't know.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.960]   I could argue either of them.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:49.120]   I'm generally inclined to say it's in the social common—you know, the common social
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:54.080]   good for the common good of all people because tax theory is actually remarkably consistent.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.120]   I used to say that tax theory was crazy and inconsistent, and then I actually started
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.920]   studying it and I found out that tax theory and policy is generally applied pretty consistently
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:09.200]   across all the different taxes and is generally applied fairly evenly.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.800]   So I'm inclined to go in that direction, but man, I can acknowledge whether intentional
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.400]   or not the fact that if you keep the money locked up until 59 and a half, it makes it
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.280]   tough for people to get at it.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.120]   Or is it a way of gaining insight into what people have?
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.040]   Every year, every single one of your retirement accounts gets reported.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.140]   The balance gets reported to the government.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:31.080]   So there's no chance for privacy in the retirement accounts.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.440]   There's no chance for privacy.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.160]   You can't make an investment that the IRS doesn't know about.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.480]   They know about all of it.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.840]   Now they could also come and you could do it at a brokerage account if you're trading
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.160]   stocks and they could know about that too.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.640]   Sure, they could subpoena that, but it's a whole lot easier if all the papers get sent
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.720]   to them every year.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.200]   So is that the key?
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.920]   Or was this lobbied by Wall Street?
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:56.480]   So it's a lot easier to buy mutual funds and put that money in your 401(k) or in your IRA
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.160]   than it is for you to do – you can do a self-directed IRA and invest in real estate,
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.520]   but it's a lot easier to do mutual funds.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.960]   So was this a Wall Street issue?
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.520]   I have no idea.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.520]   I have no idea.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:14.040]   I've never found any credible discussion on that one way or the other that was actually
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.040]   credible.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.960]   If you know of something that would go in one way or the other, let me know.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.560]   Personally I'm inclined to think it's just social policy because having been involved
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.640]   in the investment business, I see how this is a factor and legislators feel the need
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.200]   to get involved.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.320]   They don't just stand there and do something is what they say.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.020]   I would say don't do something, just stand there.
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.280]   But another conversation for another day.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.880]   So I've been involved enough, but I've also been involved enough to know there's
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.760]   a lot of industry interest that gets to play.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.480]   I was involved a lot in the insurance industry and it really bothers me when you go to meetings
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:52.280]   and you go to industry association meetings and you go to company meetings and it's
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.760]   all about here's what our lobbyist is doing.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:55.760]   Come on.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.520]   I don't want to be involved where there's a lobbyist, but I understand why you would
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.520]   have to.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.080]   If I were running a company, guess what?
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.440]   I would have my lobbyists because you have to protect your shareholders or your policy
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.980]   owners if you're a mutual insurance company, but I don't like it.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.400]   But I've been around enough to know that guess what?
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.720]   It's the finance industry, it's the investment industry, it's the insurance industry.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.080]   I don't like it, but it exists.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.600]   So I have no way of knowing that.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.460]   But here's the key.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.800]   Is there a credible reason to think that your plans might get foiled if you become too heavily
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.720]   dependent on one of these strategies?
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.400]   I think you need to be aware of it.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.280]   I think you need to be careful.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.400]   And I'll give you an example of one fairly recent change that was actually from this
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.580]   year that from earlier in this year that affected some people.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:43.320]   And the example would be the IRA rollover rules.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.440]   And will this happen with conversion rules or something like that?
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.640]   I don't know, but there's no reason why it couldn't.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.320]   And so I personally am careful about pegging everything on one of these strategies.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:00.120]   I would be uncomfortable for me if everything were based upon one of these strategies.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.200]   So let me tell you about the IRA rollover rules.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:14.600]   The IRS has various rules that allow people to avoid taxes when they're doing IRA rollovers.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:19.120]   Many of you have done this when you move money from a 401(k) into an IRA.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120]   You left a job.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.480]   You rolled the money over from a 401(k) to an IRA.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.720]   So the key is that there are different ways to do it.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:34.160]   Most of the time how this is generally practically done is you do what's called a custodian-to-custodian
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   transfer.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:41.800]   The 401(k) provider sends the money directly to your mutual IRA fund, whoever that happens
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.040]   to be.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.360]   And you never see the money.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:52.880]   Now this is also often done where you receive a check for the money, but it's made out,
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.720]   for example, it's made out to Fidelity.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.640]   So it's made out to Fidelity for the benefit of Joshua J. Sheets.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.120]   That's how investment transfers are often done.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.120]   That's common.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.680]   But the rule is that the money can actually be distributed to you as long as it's put
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.180]   into an IRA within 60 days.
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:14.320]   So I could leave a company and I could receive a 401(k) and that money could be sent to me,
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:20.200]   Joshua Sheets, and as long as within 60 days I put that money into an IRA, then in that
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.200]   scenario I don't have to pay.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.800]   It's not actually a distribution.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:24.880]   It's a rollover.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:30.960]   But I can keep the money out of the IRA, and that's the key for 60 days.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:37.720]   Now in order to avoid abuse of the rule, the IRS always said that that was based upon an
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.520]   account-by-account basis.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.840]   So if you had one IRA account and you rolled it – excuse me, you had two IRA accounts
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.800]   and you rolled one from an IRA at one place to a second IRA, you could still go back to
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.620]   the other IRA and do that one, and they would have separate 60-day windows.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:06:01.000]   So you could only do that once every 12 months, but it was on a per-account basis.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.540]   So essentially what you could do is because it was treated on an account-by-account basis,
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:12.400]   you could set up separate accounts under the IRA rollover and basically chain together
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.500]   multiple IRA rollovers, one after another.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:19.700]   So you do one, and then 60 days later you do another, you do another, you do another.
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.700]   Now how does this matter?
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:27.100]   Well, let's say you have a million dollars in IRAs, and you're trying to get out $100,000.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:32.700]   It works best if it's for a temporary need, but theoretically it could be prolonged.
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.700]   It's going to get a little bit cumbersome, but theoretically – this is theory – it
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.700]   could be prolonged.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.500]   So let's say you need $100,000 all of a sudden.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.780]   Well what you do is you take – and let's pretend that you had the foresight, and in
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.500]   my example you had 10 different accounts.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.580]   So you have 10 accounts, each having $100,000 in it.
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:56.620]   Well you take $100,000 out of IRA 1, and you spend the $100,000.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:02.820]   Then 59 days later, you take IRA 2 and you distribute the money from that, and you put
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.300]   money from IRA 2 into IRA 1.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:12.280]   And then 59 days later, you do it from IRA 3 to IRA 2, and so on and so on and so on.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.740]   So you could see how you could stretch this out.
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.180]   And you're going to have some issues with taxes, because sometimes those taxes are going
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.180]   to be withheld.
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:24.100]   20% taxes are going to be withheld, pun of a distribution to you, so you need to avoid
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.100]   that.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.100]   That's law.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.420]   Then you also need to make sure it gets done in time.
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.620]   So there are issues with it, but this is theoretically possible.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:40.100]   And this was always a well-known exception among tax law useful tricks.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:45.560]   Where you would often see this would be, for example, probably the most mainstream application
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.740]   of this among financial planners would be if you were selling one house and buying another
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.900]   one.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.940]   But you needed some money to do a down payment on the second one while you were waiting for
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.560]   the first one to close.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.360]   So you take the money out of an IRA, you put the down payment on the second house.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.620]   If you need to, and it goes for more than 60 days, you do this rollover from one to
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:07.220]   the next to make sure the money's not out for 60 days.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:10.260]   And you go ahead and then when you sell the first house, you put the money back in and
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.260]   you stop the rollover.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.900]   That was probably the most common.
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.420]   It was a little tool in our arsenal of financial planners to come up with money for a down
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:19.580]   payment when somebody's trying to come up with money for down payments.
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.220]   Better than a 401(k) loan.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.420]   So that changed.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:32.420]   And it changed earlier this year with a tax court case called Bobrow v. Commissioner.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:38.700]   You can go research this, but Bobrow is spelled B-O-B-R-O-W, Bobrow v. Commissioner.
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.420]   And basically what happened is this guy Bobrow screwed the thing up.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.660]   He basically botched the transfers.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:51.340]   And so he did it, and I think it was 62 days that it took him or 63 days, something like
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.340]   that.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.700]   So he didn't get it done.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:55.580]   He didn't get it done within 60 days.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:00.220]   And he was doing some distributions from IRAs, and it just didn't get done within the 60
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.220]   days.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.220]   So they called him on that.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.220]   I think it was 61 days.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.060]   They called him on it, and they took him to court.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.740]   And they said, "You owe the money for the distribution."
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.820]   And he fought it.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:14.180]   But the tax court ruled, and this isn't actually what the IRS argued, but what happened is
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:19.700]   the tax court didn't rule in favor of the IRS or in favor of Bobrow.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:24.860]   It ruled that the distribution was a taxable distribution because it wasn't done within
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:32.620]   60 days, but it actually interpreted the IRS laws to apply to all of an individual's IRAs
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.620]   all at once.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:38.020]   So instead of being on an account-by-account basis, which is what the official IRS doctrine
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:44.420]   was, including publication in their guidance documents as an example of how it works.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.100]   I think it was publication 590.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:52.820]   Yeah, publication 590, where they actually had examples previously of how this was applied
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:57.260]   on an account-by-account basis, and the tax court said, "No, this is applied now in
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:01.420]   aggregate on all IRAs."
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:05.820]   So it's theoretically possible that somebody could have been counting on this rollover,
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:10.060]   rollover, rollover plan to get early retirement money out.
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.300]   I think it would be a lot of hassle.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.740]   It's not necessarily easy and straightforward, but it's possible.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.740]   And I think it's instructive.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.580]   You need to be aware of the example.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:21.940]   And then—this is going to be a finger snap—then, there we go, it worked.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.460]   One tax court case, and boom, it's changed.
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:29.500]   So the IRS went back, it changed the code, changed the examples, updated publication
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.820]   590.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:36.620]   Bo browsed out the money, his plan didn't work, and now we have different rules.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.940]   And there's no reason, in my opinion, why rules can't change.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.460]   So the Roth conversion ladder, is there any reason why it couldn't change?
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.160]   I don't think there's any reason why it couldn't change.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.380]   You would then have to look and say, "Well, is the doctrine consistent with what's going
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:50.380]   on?"
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:55.380]   But the problem is that, how do you deal with the winds of public climate?
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:00.380]   All this stuff is built in these massive pieces of legislation and it brings sweeping changes.
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:04.660]   So I mean, a lot of people hear this information and say, "Well, that's it.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.900]   I'm just not even going to play the game."
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.900]   And I understand it.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.900]   I get it.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.580]   A lot of people, however, say, "Okay, here, I'm going to play the game."
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:15.140]   And most people, what is reality is that most of us wander into this stuff.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:19.640]   You get a job and you wander into your 401(k), you wander into your IRA or your Roth IRA
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.760]   when your dad tells you to do it, and then years later, you're looking at your situation
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   saying, "What do I do?"
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.760]   So my point is that there are various ways around this.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:32.040]   You have to look at it as an individual and say, "What are your assets?
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.120]   What's your asset makeup?
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.160]   What are the risks of your situation versus the rewards?
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.640]   What's the potential savings versus the not?"
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.400]   And you've got to actually look at your situation.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:46.700]   There's no way that I'm willing at the moment to make up a generalized broad sweeping statement,
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:53.520]   but I hope with this information, you can figure out what would be good for you and
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520]   you can calculate it.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.360]   The key with all these things is you need to actually calculate it for yourself.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.400]   So that's it for today's show.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.360]   I hope you enjoyed this content.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.440]   I hope I hit my goal, so you tell me if you liked it or not.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   Check back tomorrow.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.240]   I'm releasing an interview with Tammy Strobel from Rowdy Kittens.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:17.720]   We're going to talk about minimalism and how it has helped in her and her husband's financial
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.720]   planning.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.720]   I think you'll enjoy that.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.400]   Wednesday, I think I'm going to talk about college planning.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.240]   I've got openings for Friday's Q&A.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.240]   I would love some feedback on the Q&A.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.800]   If you're listening to it, if you're not listening to it, let me know.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:34.600]   I did a two-hour show on Friday with the Q&A thinking that I felt guilty last week when
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.600]   I cut myself off at an hour.
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.040]   I wanted to answer the questions, but I know many of you have trouble with those two-hour
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040]   shows.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.600]   I feel like I did an okay job at answering the questions, but it was long because I did
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.600]   a lot of questions.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.160]   So I'm still trying to figure out the format here and figure out what's helpful and what's
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   not.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.720]   Thank you for those of you so far who have signed up for the membership program for the
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.720]   Irregulars.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.320]   I thank you for it.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.720]   It hasn't been – well, I dumped probably 70 percent of the audience right when I launched
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.240]   it, so a little hard to know.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.840]   It hasn't been enough where I can just quit everything I'm doing now, but it's certainly
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.680]   been a few of you who have signed up, and I really thank you for that, and I appreciate
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.680]   it.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.000]   If you value the show and the content and the information that I'm bringing, I would
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.840]   be thrilled to have you as a member of the Irregulars.
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.040]   That is how I've designed – if you like information like this, it's straightforward,
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.400]   it's unbiased, I'm hoping that I can build a membership program that will support the
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.400]   show.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.400]   I'd love to have you support it.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.120]   It's $10 a month or $100 a year.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.040]   Listen, if you don't have the money – I received some feedback from the listeners
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.120]   that I want to support it, but I don't have the $10.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.120]   Don't worry about it.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.120]   Apply the concepts.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.120]   It's all for free.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.120]   It's why I'm doing this.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.040]   Apply the concepts and consider it my contribution to your financial independence.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.680]   If or when you're able to get to the point where you do have the money, I would be thrilled
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.320]   if you wanted to support it at that point in time.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.480]   But if you can't afford it, then don't worry about it.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.120]   So go buy – if you're interested, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/membership.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:58.720]   I think that's it for 104.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:09.600]   Anyway, go check out the membership program.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.200]   We'll be thrilled to have all of you to join that.
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   And thank you for listening.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:21.200]   I'll be back with you tomorrow.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.440]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:31.440]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.740]   Your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.480]   about you.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:46.800]   This show is not, and is not intended to be any form of financial advice.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:55.160]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.600]   trustworthy.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:02.520]   And consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific needs, your
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:08.200]   specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.920]   Hold them accountable for your results.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.400]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.480]   person and I make mistakes.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.920]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please come by the show page and comment
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.440]   so we can all learn together.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.200]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.480]   The holidays start here at Ralph's with a variety of options to celebrate traditions
