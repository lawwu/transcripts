[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.520]   wars over some words. I think wars have a lot of power. It's actually
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   It's actually an interesting question
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   It's actually an interesting question where the wisdom of the world, the wisdom of humanity is in words or in visual, is it in the physical. I don't really, it's in mathematics. Maybe it all boils down to math and in the end, this kind of discussion about real world AI versus language is all the same.

[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:48.080]   He says even the best are molded out of faults.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   And so you take the faults of Musk, for example, which includes a craziness that can be endearing, but also craziness.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   It's just like effing crazy.

[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.320]   And so I say to Woz, "What's the answer to your question?"
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.180]   And he said, "Well, if I had been running Apple,
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.740]   I would have been nicer to everybody.

[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:27.640]   -Apple, I don't think we would have done.

[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   -And Job said the same thing that Moz said to me,

[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:49.140]   Well, as you said, this kind of idea did also send a signal.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:54.160]   This idea of Steve Giles with eight players, it did send a signal to everybody.

[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:49.740]   I think this is a good opportunity to maybe go through some of the memorable moments of the Twitter saga, as you've written about extensively in your book, from the early days of considering the acquisition to how it went
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:49.740]   through to the details of the acquisition.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:49.740]   The acquisition to how it went through to the details of the acquisition.

[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:16.340]   He was trying to figure out where to go from here. And at that time, it was early April, they were going to offer him a board seat and he was going to do a standstill agreement and stop at ten percent or something. Now remember, you know, we were standing around. It was Luke Nozick, whom you know well, Ken Howery, some of his friends on that mezzanine here.

[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   Do you want to get out?
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   Do you want to stay in?
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   Do you want to reduce the price?
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   And I think he was mercurial.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   There were times he would text me or say to me, "This is going to be great. It's going to be the accelerant to do X.com the way we thought about 20 years ago."
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   And so it's not until they finally tell him at the beginning of October, right when Optimus the Robot is being unveiled in California actually,
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   and they offered him options.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   And they offered him options.

[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:15.420]   Eventually the deal is going to close on a, I think a Friday morning. I have it in the book.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:15.420]   And we're there on Thursday and he's wandering around looking at the stay woke t-shirts and psychological safety lingo.

[01:22:46.260 --> 01:23:16.260]   Dane can be full of this just richness and like you just have to really take it in intensely. So like the switching enables that kind of intensity because most of us can't hold that intensity anyone task for a prolonged period of time. Maybe that's also a lesson.
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:16.260]   Right. And I guess it goes back to also know who you are, meaning there are people who can focus intensely and there are people who can see patterns across many things.

[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:46.340]  , and you write about individuals and I love it.

[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.400]   So one of the questions the book addresses is,
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:49.420]   you know, I'm not only made my peace with it at times.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:51.360]   is it individuals or is it groups that turn the tides of history?
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.400]   is it individuals or is it groups that turn the tides of history?
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.360]   is it individuals or is it groups that turn the tides of history?
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.860]   When Henry Kissinger was on the shuttle missions for the Middle East peace,
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:03.160]   is the first book I ever wrote,
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:06.360]   he said, "When I was a professor at Harvard,
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:12.580]   I thought that history was determined by great forces and groups of people.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:16.360]   But when I see it up close, I see what a difference an individual has.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:46.380]  ,
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:46.400]   and I think that's what makes history a great force and group of people.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   I think that's what makes history a great force and group of people.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   I think that's what makes history a great force and group of people.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   I think that's what I'm doing here today.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   I think that's what I'm doing here today is to make a great force and group of people.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   I think that I'm not only making history is a great force and group of people.

[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:55.960]   It's a really big complex picture. And biographies of ideas that involve individuals. Well, step one for me is trying to figure out how the mind works.

Yeah, so that is just genuine curiosity but there's something, when you talk about just one-on-one interaction, whether it's Elon or Steve Jobs or, there's something beautiful about that person's mind and it feels like it's possible to reveal that, to discover that together efficiently.

[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:35.260]  , and that's kind of the goal of a conversation. Well, I mean, look, you're amongst the top podcasters and interviewers in the world today. You have an earnestness to you. Ben Franklin is the person who taught me, I mean, by reading him, the most about on conversation. He wrote a wonderful essay on that. It includes on silence.

[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:28.180]  , while telling a deeply human story? Yeah, I mean, I want to be honest, which I think is akin to being objective. I try to keep in mind, who am I writing for? I'm not writing for Elon Musk, as I say. I haven't sent him the book. I don't know if he, I don't think he's read it yet. I've got one person I'm writing for. The open-minded, real-time person.

[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:22.860]   But from having written biographies, having studied so many great men and women, what advice could you give to people of how to live this life?
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:28.860]   Well, I keep going back to the classics and Plato and Aristotle and Socrates.
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:36.860]   And I guess it's Plato's maxim, but he may be quoting Socrates, that the unexamined life is not worth living.

[01:58:37.400 --> 01:59:05.900]  , and it gets back to the know thyself, which is, you don't have to figure out what is the big meaning of it all.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:05.900]   But you have to figure out why you're doing what you're doing.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:05.900]   And that requires something that I did not have enough of when I was young, which is self-awareness and examining every motive, everything I do.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:05.900]   And I guess it's Plato's maxim, but he may be quoting Socrates, that the unexamined life is not worth living.

[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:13.940]   Where does the examination lead you?
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:14.940]   Is it to a shift in life trajectory?

[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:23.100]   I was probably too ambitious when I was young and at Time Magazine. That was when I was green. And, oh, well, that was when I was in my salad days and green and judgment.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:46.680]  , and it was like chasing the next level at Time Incorporated, whatever it might be. And then one day I caught the brass ring and I became an editor and then the top editor. And after a while I realized that wasn't really totally what I'm suited to be, especially when I got put in charge of CNN.
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:01:10.260]  , I mean, all young people are almost by definition in their salad days and green and judgment. But you learn what's motivating you and then you learn to ask, "Is that really what I want? Should I be careful of what I'm wishing for?"
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:10.260]  ,
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:44.580]  ,
[02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:45.140]   and then I was like, "I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.",
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:45.140]   I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.
