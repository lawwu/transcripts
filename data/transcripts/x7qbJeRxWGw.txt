[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.660]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.400]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.060]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.060]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.100]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.960]   to the general public.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.220]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.240]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.540]   Our first sponsor is Four Sigmatic.
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.460]   Four Sigmatic is a wellness company
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.060]   that makes mushroom coffee.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.200]   And if you're asking yourself,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.380]   why would you want to put mushrooms in coffee?
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.360]   First of all, let me tell you,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.480]   these are not psychedelic mushrooms,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.040]   and no, the coffee doesn't taste like mushrooms.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.640]   The coffee is delicious,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.880]   and you don't taste mushrooms at all.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.980]   I know this because I've been using Four Sigmatic coffee
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.920]   and been stocking it in my laboratory for several years now,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.900]   long before I ever had the podcast,
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.100]   or Four Sigmatic was a sponsor.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.520]   The two kinds of mushrooms that are in Four Sigmatic coffee
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.220]   are lion's mane and chaga mushrooms,
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.260]   both of which have been shown
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.600]   to have a slight anxiolytic effect to reduce anxiety.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.440]   And lion's mane has also been shown in several studies
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   to lower the symptoms of depression just slightly,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.120]   although I wouldn't consider it a treatment for depression.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.640]   That's an attractive benefit,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.020]   as well as have some effect at offsetting cognitive decline.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.140]   Albeit slightly, the effects were real
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.600]   in the studies that I've found.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.220]   So if you'd like to try Four Sigmatic,

[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.760]   Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.320]   condensed down to just 15 minutes of key takeaways
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.480]   that you can read or listen to.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.200]   I'm a big reader and I'm a big consumer of nonfiction.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.800]   And most of the time I consume books
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.920]   in their traditional form,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.380]   like a book where you flip the pages and so forth.
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.640]   I also listen to full length audio books.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.600]   However, over time, we know that we forget lots of things.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.840]   And even though sometimes I think
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.320]   I got all the critical information from a book,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.200]   when I listen to Blinkist and I get the 15 minute rundown,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.840]   either in audio or in written form,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.400]   what I find is there are key points
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.940]   that oftentimes I missed.
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.000]   And so it's a great way for me to both jog my memory
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.260]   and to bring forward ideas
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.360]   that I hadn't considered previously.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.860]   They have thousands of nonfiction titles
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.320]   and some really terrific ones in the science category.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.080]   For example, David Eagleman's book, "Livewired,"
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.840]   which came out recently as a book I read in full length form
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.920]   and I've listened to the Blinkist version of it as well.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.140]   "Livewired" is a book about neuroplasticity,
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.440]   the brain's ability to change in response to experience.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.760]   I get so many questions and requests for books
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.220]   about neuroplasticity.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.500]   In my opinion, "Livewired" is the most recent
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.340]   and up to date and the best one to date.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.400]   So that's there.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.640]   David Sinclair's book, "Lifespan."
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.200]   David, as many of you know,
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.740]   is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.900]   "Lifespan" is this terrific book about aging as a disease
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.520]   and the future and present of longevity treatments.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.860]   Very interesting book.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.180]   As well as Matt Walker's book, "Why We Sleep."
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.520]   Matt, of course, is a professor at UC Berkeley.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.480]   And "Why We Sleep" is a terrific book
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.940]   about why we sleep, the science of sleeping
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.620]   and things you can do to improve your sleep.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.360]   All of those are on Blinkist.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.200]   But with Blinkist, you get unlimited access
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.800]   to their massive library of nonfiction.

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   This episode is also brought to us by Monk Pack.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.680]   Monk Pack is a company that makes keto friendly snacks
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.060]   that taste incredible,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.040]   but have just one gram of sugar or less.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.840]   As I've said before on this podcast,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.040]   I am not in ketosis, I'm not ketogenic.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.980]   I don't advocate or follow any one particular diet.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.940]   For me, what works is to fast in the early part of the day
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.560]   and to eat low carb and keto-ish throughout the day.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.980]   That's for alertness and attention so I can work and focus
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.360]   and I don't feel sluggish or brain fog.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.060]   And then at night and in the evening
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.100]   is when I tend to eat my carbohydrates
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.680]   to aid the transition to sleep.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.180]   That's what works for me.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.580]   Monk Pack bars are a terrific snack
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.120]   whether or not your keto all the time,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.580]   whether or not you're low carb or even if you're not,
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.320]   they are absolutely delicious.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.760]   And I don't say that lightly.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.840]   I'm not a big fan of bars in general.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.860]   Most bars to me tastes like a combination
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.320]   of a metal bumper mixed with some cardboard
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.120]   and some lawn trimmings and some artificial sugar.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.880]   Monk Pack bars, when they were sent to me,
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.960]   I was like, all right, I'll try them.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.400]   I tried it like, uh-oh, this is a problem
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.160]   'cause I like them very, very much.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.560]   And when I say it's a problem, it really is a problem.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.680]   I actually keep the Monk Pack boxes in my basement
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.520]   so that I don't tear through them all at once.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.400]   I'm a huge fan of the caramel sea salt flavor.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.820]   It's delicious, just talking about it.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.200]   It makes me hungry for one.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.180]   But they also have sea salt, dark chocolate,
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.880]   peanut butter dark chocolate.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.000]   They're terrific.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.360]   In addition to being keto friendly,
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.680]   they're also gluten-free, plant-based, non-GMO,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.840]   no soy, trans fat, sugar alcohols, or artificial colors.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.380]   So all the bad stuff that you don't want.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.560]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.440]   they're keto less than one gram of sugar.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.540]   If you want to try Monk Pack, you can go to monkpack.com.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.360]   That's M-U-N-K pack.com

[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.720]   This month, we've been talking all about hormones,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.840]   which are these absolutely incredible chemicals
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.640]   in our brain and body.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.520]   They impact our entire lifespan.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.080]   So from the time that we are in the womb,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.160]   they're controlling the development of our brain
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.480]   and our bodies.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.420]   After we are born, they're still controlling
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.360]   the development of our brain and bodies.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.580]   And I did say development and that's because,
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.200]   contrary to what most people think,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.980]   development lasts the entire lifespan.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.040]   From the time you're conceived until the time you die,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.720]   you are developing, you are changing
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.600]   and hormones are constantly updating and changing
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.680]   the different functions of your body.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.000]   They have two major kinds of effects.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.600]   One are immediate effects, so they can actually bind to
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.960]   or kind of park in parking spots on cells
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.880]   and impact all sorts of things
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.840]   like the growth of cells, et cetera.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.320]   They also can control gene expression.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.200]   This is the way that hormones during puberty
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.320]   control body hair growth and breast development
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.120]   and growth of muscles and limbs and height
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.100]   and all sorts of things.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.600]   They are incredible.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.160]   We've talked about testosterone and estrogen.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.720]   We talked about insulin and glucagon
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.000]   and some of the other things.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.760]   Today, we are going to talk about metabolism,
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.640]   mainly going to talk about thyroid hormone
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.280]   and growth hormone and some other related pathways.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.840]   I'm going to explain to you the logic
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.140]   of how thyroid hormone and growth hormone work.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.320]   It will become obvious why I've paired thyroid
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.760]   and growth hormone together in the same episode.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.680]   And I will, of course, talk about tools that you can use
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.680]   to elevate or reduce thyroid hormone.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.580]   There are cases where people want to reduce thyroid hormone.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.140]   I will talk about tools that you can use
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.120]   to elevate growth hormone.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.680]   There are rare cases where people want
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.900]   to reduce growth hormone.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.360]   Most people are interested in increasing growth hormone.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.740]   So today is going to be rich with information,
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.980]   rich with actionable tools.
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.040]   And as always, the idea is to spell out
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.240]   an organizational logic so you can come away
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.780]   from this episode and in fact, the entire month on hormones,
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.200]   really understanding at some level
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.920]   what these things we call hormones are and how they work.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.600]   And that's really to arm you
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.740]   to encounter information going forward,
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.040]   whether or not it comes from me or from somebody else,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.060]   a book or a course, someplace else online,
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.080]   to make sense of how to work
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.000]   with these incredible chemicals we call hormones.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.920]   Before we begin to talk about thyroid and growth hormone
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.000]   and how our metabolism works
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.500]   and how to control metabolism,
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.520]   I want to answer a few questions that I received from you,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.360]   from the audience.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.240]   Every once in a while,
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.540]   someone will send me a quite earnest question
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.140]   about something they saw on the internet.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.820]   And one of the things I've heard about quite a bit
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.800]   in the last couple of weeks
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.480]   is we've been talking about hormones and food intake
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.160]   and how those interact is this question of,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.880]   are certain foods particularly good
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.640]   for certain organs of the body
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.900]   and can that be predicted
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.140]   on the basis of the shape of those foods?
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.060]   So, first of all,
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.760]   I want to acknowledge the question as a valid one
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.600]   because I see this every once in a while out there,
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.440]   people will say,
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.720]   "Well, walnuts are in the shape of the brain
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.420]   and therefore they are good for your brain."
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.900]   Or a particular fruit like the beet
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.840]   often looks like a heart and it's good for your heart.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.400]   And I certainly invite questions of all kinds
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.160]   provided they are sincere questions.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   However, I am not aware of any science whatsoever
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.800]   supporting the idea that the shape of a given food
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.620]   or object for that matter
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.160]   is relevant to its functional role in the body
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.480]   in reference to biology.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.640]   Now, beets contain something
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.680]   that we're going to talk about today.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.360]   They contain a substance called arginine,
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.540]   which actually can control the dilation of blood vessels
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.760]   and arteries.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.720]   So it has some relationship to heart and heart health.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.840]   Walnuts contain various fatty acids that maybe,
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.160]   I want to underscore maybe,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.200]   beneficial for certain aspects of brain health.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.960]   But there's no evidence whatsoever
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.940]   that the shape of the food itself is relevant.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.720]   And I think what's happened is,
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.880]   is that people have gone out there
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.340]   and found foods that contain certain substances
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.100]   like carrots and vitamin A
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.920]   or walnuts and particular fatty acids or beets and arginine.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.060]   And they've selected the foods
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.380]   that happen to be in the shape of the thing,
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.260]   the organ that the particular substance like vitamin A
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.540]   or fatty acids and so forth might benefit or support.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.340]   But of course, there are many, many other sources
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.580]   of these nutrients that don't come from walnuts
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.060]   or from beets or from carrots.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.620]   And so I guess the short way to put it
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.360]   is that the idea that the shape of some food
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.980]   is an indication of whether or not that food
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.980]   would be healthy for a particular organ in the body
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.600]   is absolutely unfounded.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.560]   I don't know of any evidence for it.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.840]   And I'm not out to quash anybody's great love of these foods.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.000]   I enjoy all the foods I just described,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.480]   but the shape of things in the physical universe
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   bears very little, if any relevance to the nutrients
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.520]   that it contains and therefore the organs that it supports.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.360]   So thank you for your question.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   But if you see that out there,
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.620]   I don't even think you need to tell the person
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.880]   who's putting that information out into the world.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.600]   I would just back away slowly.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.480]   One other thing before we move into today's material,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.060]   last episode, I talked about the problems with emulsifiers
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.880]   in highly processed foods
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.980]   and the way that they can strip the mucosal lining
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.260]   of the gut and they can limit the signaling of hormones
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.140]   like CCK that can signal to the brain satiety,
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.260]   the signal to stop eating.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.360]   And then we got into a discussion
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.500]   about artificial sweeteners.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.980]   And I threw out Stevia as an artificial sweetener
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.900]   and several people reached out to correct me
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.040]   that Stevia is not an artificial sweetener.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.980]   It is a non-caloric sweetener and you are correct.
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.940]   I lumped artificial and non-caloric sweeteners together.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.140]   And thanks to many of you that also sent me some references,
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.180]   it does not appear that Stevia can negatively impact
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.260]   the gut microbiome.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.920]   It does seem unique among non-caloric sweeteners.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.860]   There are probably others out there.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.140]   The other thing that we discussed
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.120]   is how Stevia can lead to slight increases in blood glucose
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.920]   but can also improve insulin management just slightly,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.820]   probably cancels to zero in terms of its impact
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.140]   on blood glucose provided it's not at concentrations
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.340]   that are super, super sweet.
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.460]   Ingestion of anything that's very sweet,
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.640]   whether or not it contains calories or not,
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.980]   artificial or not, will create an insulin response.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.700]   In fact, just walking past a bakery
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.180]   and smelling delicious baked goods
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.140]   can increase your insulin secretion.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.260]   And so I just want to point that out.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.760]   Thank you for the information and the references
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.600]   that you found.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.480]   Please send additional ones if you do find them.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.440]   And I appreciate that you allow me to make corrections.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.640]   Every once in a while I misspeak here
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.080]   and the opportunity to make corrections
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.740]   keeps us all on the same page.
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.980]   And please do keep any feedback that you have
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.760]   about particular things I cover here coming my way.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.680]   There is so much interest in metabolism.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.820]   We hear about having a high or a low metabolism.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.860]   There are some people out there
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.160]   who would like to reduce their metabolism.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.280]   They simply can't eat enough to maintain their weight.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.800]   Most people, however, struggle with the opposite issue.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.420]   They struggle to maintain a healthy weight
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.060]   and/or their metabolism is too low.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.460]   Now, there are a variety of reasons
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.160]   why metabolism can be low.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.220]   Today, we are going to talk about two hormones,
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.420]   thyroid hormone and its related pathways
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.740]   and growth hormone and its related pathways,
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.540]   which arguably are the two hormones
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.060]   and two systems in the body that are most significant
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.040]   for setting your overall level of metabolism.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.260]   Before we dive into those,
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.860]   I just want to cover a little bit of what metabolism is.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.920]   And I want to talk about which organs in your body
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.340]   use the most energy.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.480]   So metabolism is the consumption of energy,
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.820]   not necessarily eating,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.060]   but it's the use of energy in the cells of the body
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.480]   for growth of tissues, for repair of tissues,
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.780]   and also just for day-to-day maintenance of function.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.420]   A good example of maintenance of function
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.700]   would be your brain.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.820]   Most of your metabolic needs,
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.900]   your so-called basal or resting metabolic needs
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.800]   are for your brain, for thinking.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.680]   If you were to just sit in a bed all day
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.780]   and do nothing but think,
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.540]   that consumes about 75% of your metabolic needs.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.820]   Now, there's also moving around.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.540]   If you have a job that requires a lot of heavy labor
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.400]   or lifting things, or you're a new parent
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.500]   and you're carrying kids around
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.620]   and you're going up and down the stairs
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.060]   or back and forth to the refrigerator for formula, et cetera,
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.700]   well, then you're burning more energy,
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.760]   burning more calories.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.420]   But even if you are very physically active,
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.940]   unless you're an ultra marathoner or a marathoner,
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.700]   chances are that 75% of your metabolic needs
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.540]   are coming just from your brain.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.340]   And that's because neurons consume a lot of energy.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.220]   Neurons, of course, are just the nerve cells of your brain.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.660]   So these two hormones, thyroid hormone and growth hormone,
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.900]   we think of as related to metabolism of things in the body,
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.940]   keeping body fat low and keeping muscles strong
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.780]   and tendons strong and repairing themselves, et cetera.
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.980]   But they are also key for brain function,
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:54.200]   for the ability to maintain cognitive function
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.780]   throughout the lifespan.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.960]   So the big theme I'd like to introduce
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.360]   is that metabolism isn't just about losing weight,
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.900]   but having a high metabolism,
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.620]   provided it's not too high, is great.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.560]   It means that you will have more lean tissue,
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.120]   more bone and muscle and less adipose tissue, fat.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.080]   And we know that that's healthy.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.320]   How much fat and how much muscle?
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.040]   Well, that varies and the numbers on this
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.200]   are always shifting.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   But in general, muscle and its related tissues
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.820]   burns more energy than does adipose tissue or fat.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.420]   And the water in your body doesn't consume any energy.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.980]   So metabolism can be increased
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.340]   simply by adding muscle to your body
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.500]   and reducing fat or adjusting the ratio of the two.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.340]   But regardless,
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.700]   even if you're not interested in changing body composition,
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.140]   these two hormones, thyroid hormone and growth hormone
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.520]   are super important for metabolism of all kinds,
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.860]   including tissue repair after injury,
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.680]   including maintaining cognitive function and wellbeing
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.660]   and the ability to think clearly as you age,
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.680]   offsetting dementia and so forth.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.620]   So the big theme here
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.020]   really includes the previous episodes.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.020]   You don't have to have seen those episodes,
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.100]   but for the last three episodes and today as well,
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.440]   we've been talking about hormones,
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.660]   these substances that are released
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.700]   from one location in the body
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.140]   that go and act other locations in the body.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.260]   I'm going to tell you how that works
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.860]   for thyroid and growth hormone.
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.580]   But now that you've heard about testosterone and estrogen
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.000]   and you're going to hear about thyroid and growth hormone,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I want you to realize that there's a repeating logic.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.540]   First of all, there are neurons in your brain
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.980]   in an area called the hypothalamus,
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.160]   which it just means it's below the thalamus hypo.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.020]   It sits at the base of your brain in the front,
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.320]   it's part of the forebrain.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.160]   So it's more or less above the roof of your mouth,
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.980]   maybe about a centimeter or so,
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.020]   and then about a centimeter forward in most people.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.420]   And neurons in the hypothalamus
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:54.260]   release hormones that are called releasing hormones.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.020]   So we've talked in previous episodes about, for instance,
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.580]   gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.140]   So those are little neurons that then signal
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.260]   another brain area called the pituitary
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.860]   to release other hormones.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.040]   Today, we're going to see this again.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.740]   In the brain, you have neurons that release
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.580]   thyrotropin or thyroid-releasing hormone.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.780]   You also have growth hormone-releasing hormone.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.740]   So anytime you hear releasing,
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.180]   chances are those are neurons that are in your brain
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.220]   and they extend little wires we call axons
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.540]   into your pituitary.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.380]   And the pituitary releases a bunch of hormones
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.380]   into the bloodstream and the pituitary releases things
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.540]   that most often have the name of stimulating hormone
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.660]   because they stimulate organs.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.420]   So in keeping with the theme of thyroid hormone,
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.500]   you have thyroid-releasing hormone in the brain,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.740]   tells the pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.540]   And then the thyroid, which we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.420]   releases thyroid hormones.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.980]   In the testosterone and estrogen episode,
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.800]   we talked about how you have
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.500]   gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.340]   There's the releasing again up in the brain,
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.060]   remember, releasing hormone comes from the brain.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.420]   Then you had things like luteinizing hormone
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.020]   and follicle-stimulating hormone,
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.360]   which were in the pituitary,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.540]   and those traveled to the ovaries or the testes
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.700]   and acted on those tissues, okay?
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.700]   So please try and embed this logic.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.500]   If you hear the word releasing hormone,
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.120]   it's coming from the brain,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.580]   and that makes it actionable in certain ways
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.580]   that we'll return to later.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.740]   In addition, the pituitary is letting go
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.340]   of all these hormones into the bloodstream
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.460]   that are stimulating different tissues.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.660]   So for thyroid, it's thyroid-stimulating hormone,
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.860]   and then it goes to the thyroid.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.160]   And the thyroid is a little butterfly-shaped gland
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.200]   that's right around the Adam's apple.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.840]   If you want to see yours,
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.760]   not directly 'cause it's got skin over it,
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.080]   what you would do is you'd take a sip of water,
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   you'd look in the mirror, and you'd swallow.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.180]   And the thing that moves up and down, that is your thyroid.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.100]   Now, some people call it your Adam's apple
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.780]   because it sits right near this protrusion in the trachea,
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.620]   which is the Adam's apple.
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.320]   No matter whether or not you're male, female,
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.500]   or regardless of what your chromosomal background is,
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.420]   everyone has an Adam's apple.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.060]   It tends to be more pronounced in people
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.340]   that got a surge of testosterone early in development
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.620]   because it has a testosterone sensitivity to it,
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.700]   and that actually controls the timbre,
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.180]   the so-called deepness of the voice.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.540]   So the thyroid gland sits right there,
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.520]   and it's got four little bumps behind it
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.980]   called the parathyroid gland,
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.460]   and it releases two hormones into the blood
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.780]   to stimulate different tissues and their metabolism,
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.380]   and those hormones are called T4 and T3.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.700]   So if this is already sounding like a lot of information,
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.020]   it's really easy, I promise.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.480]   Releasing hormone comes from the brain,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.560]   stimulating hormone comes from the pituitary,
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.220]   and in this case, we're talking about the thyroid
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.620]   binding up that stimulating hormone and saying,
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.940]   "Oh, I need to release something,"
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.380]   and it releases T4 and T3.
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.220]   And guess what?
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.940]   You can basically forget about T4.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.100]   T4, it's not completely inactive, it has some roles,
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.840]   but T3 is the one that's more or less active.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.980]   Now, what does thyroid hormone do?
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.560]   A lot of people think, "Oh, thyroid, it's like metabolism,
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.780]   and people who are hypothyroid
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.580]   all have bulging eyes and are real thin,
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.840]   and people who have hypothyroid are overweight,
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.380]   and their eyes are half closed or something."
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.780]   And indeed, thyroid hormone controls
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.840]   a lot of the features of the face and the eyes,
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.120]   and it can control amounts of adipose tissue and so forth.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.120]   But the main role of thyroid hormone, of T3,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.840]   is to promote metabolism.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.920]   And that doesn't just mean the consumption of energy,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.840]   it means the utilization of energy,
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.240]   including the buildup of tissues.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.680]   So it acts on all sorts of target tissues in the body.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.340]   It acts on muscle, it acts on the liver,
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.060]   it acts on the cartilage, it acts on the bone.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.420]   And it's not just involved in using energy,
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.980]   it's also converting energy.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.740]   I do realize I said that twice.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.740]   It's involved in taking fats
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.980]   and breaking them down into fatty acids
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.440]   and converting those into ATP,
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.760]   which is an important thing for cells to use energy.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.180]   It's also involved in taking sugars
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.100]   and turning those into energy.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.560]   And yes, it goes to adipose tissue, to fat.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.440]   We have different kinds of fat that we'll talk about today,
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.520]   but it goes to white fat
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.920]   and it liberates or helps liberate some of the fats
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.600]   from those fat cells and use them for energy.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.960]   And this is why higher thyroid
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.360]   is associated with leaner bodies.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.400]   Lower thyroid is associated with less lean bodies.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.580]   So one thing that's absolutely key and is actionable,
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:42.360]   we're right there already in discussing tools, is iodine.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.300]   Iodine comes from things in the ocean, right?
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.160]   And here are a couple of interesting facts about iodine.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.620]   And then we'll talk about whether or not
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.960]   you should be supplementing iodine or not.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.960]   First of all, iodine is most common in sea salt,
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.040]   in kelp and in seaweed.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.960]   And most people can get enough iodine
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.720]   from the food they eat and/or the table salt they consume.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.600]   Almost all table salt from all over the world,
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.060]   regardless of where you are, contains iodine.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:22.960]   The thyroid needs iodine in order to produce thyroid hormone
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   and you need sufficient levels of thyroid hormone.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.180]   Not too much, but you need it.
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.540]   So chances are you are getting enough iodine,
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.160]   although you might not,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.560]   especially those of you following a particularly
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.320]   quote unquote clean diet might not be getting enough iodine.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.720]   Here's the deal with iodine.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.320]   Iodine combines with an amino acid
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.400]   that we've talked about before called L-tyrosine.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.680]   L-tyrosine comes from meat, from nuts.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.840]   There are some plant-based sources as well.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.720]   It is the precursor to dopamine.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   But in the thyroid, iodine combines or works with L-tyrosine
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.220]   to produce T3 and T4, the thyroid hormone.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.440]   So you absolutely need sufficient iodine.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.880]   You need sufficient L-tyrosine.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.200]   And then you also need something else,
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.220]   which is called selenium.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.740]   And we'll talk about selenium in a moment.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.080]   So there's a condition
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.440]   that shows up in little pockets in the world.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   It's not super common, meaning it's not very widespread,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.020]   but in certain areas that are far away from the ocean.
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.120]   At one point, this was historically
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.000]   in the Midwestern states of the United States,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.520]   in some mountain regions of other countries,
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.520]   in some areas of Africa that were far from the ocean.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.260]   People would get extremely swollen bulges in their necks.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.520]   And this was called goiter.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.080]   And the reason they were getting those swollen bulges
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.660]   is because the thyroid itself was hypertrophy.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.660]   It was growing in an attempt to churn out more thyroid.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.480]   And because it was getting a lot of stimulating hormone
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.000]   from the pituitary.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.140]   But, and I don't want to go too far off track here,
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.320]   but as you recall, the brain and the pituitary
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.040]   are paying attention in a cellular sense
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.920]   to the levels of hormones in the blood.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.740]   And when those hormones get too high,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.280]   they shut off the stimulating hormone.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.740]   They shut down the signal to make more,
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.020]   kind of like a thermostat.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.780]   When the levels are too low,
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.860]   like there's not enough testosterone in the bloodstream,
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.980]   or there's not enough estrogen,
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.120]   the brain will continue to push out the signal to make more.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.620]   Similarly, if there's not enough thyroid circulating,
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.240]   or there's not enough iodine to make thyroid,
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.880]   therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.480]   the thyroid gland itself is not getting shut down.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.060]   There's tons of stimulating hormone
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.460]   and releasing hormone coming from the brain,
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.580]   like release, release, release.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.380]   And there's no way they can make thyroid hormone
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.340]   instead the gland just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.880]   And so people get goiter.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.220]   This is one of the reasons why table salt has iodine in it.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.180]   Although there are other foods
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.420]   that have iodine in it as well.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.340]   So how much iodine do you need?
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.400]   Well, you don't need a whole lot.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.140]   Some people who are hypothyroidal might,
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.100]   and I want to emphasize might,
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.780]   you absolutely should talk to your doctor.
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.960]   This is a serious matter.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.100]   Anytime you're talking about hormones
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.860]   or manipulating levels of thyroid,
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.700]   you absolutely want to talk to your doctor.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.340]   Some people benefit from supplementing iodine.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.940]   It is contained in most salts.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.680]   It's in Himalayan salt, not always, but often.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.940]   I know these days there's a lot of excitement
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.580]   about pink salts and sea salts,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.020]   and the kind of artisan salt thing has kind of taken off
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.420]   in the foodie land, which is great.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.380]   Some of them are actually quite tasty.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.180]   You can just take it directly if you like the taste of salt,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.280]   but iodine can be supplemented through things like kelp
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.940]   and seaweed and kelp tablets.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.060]   Now, if you are hyperthyroidal, you make too much thyroid,
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.780]   that actually can be a problem.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.280]   So really the best way to figure this out
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.060]   is to get your blood levels tested of thyroid hormone.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.980]   But there's so much iodine in the ocean
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.520]   that believe it or not, people that live near the coast
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.540]   can actually just absorb it through the air
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.320]   just by breathing ocean air.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.460]   So that gives you a sense of just how little iodine
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.660]   you actually need to consume in food or in salt.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.260]   So if you're within a few miles of the ocean
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.720]   or you visit the ocean from time to time,
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.580]   you're probably getting plenty.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.520]   It does have to come together, as I mentioned,
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.380]   with L-tyrosine, and this is why foods
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.820]   that contain L-tyrosine,
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.960]   and provided that you have sufficient iodine in your diet,
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.000]   and if you have sufficient selenium in your diet,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.600]   does serve to increase your metabolism.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.860]   And that is, again, is for the growth and repair of tissues.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.560]   And that's really important.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.520]   It's not just about keeping your metabolism high
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.920]   so that you can be on the leaner side of things
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.100]   or adjust your body weight, excuse me,
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.760]   your body composition ratios the way you like.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.040]   Repair of injuries, repair of brain tissue,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.840]   clearance of any damage from neurons,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.440]   clearance of any damage to the body
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.180]   is also going to depend on thyroid.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.820]   Again, metabolism being this kind of rate of fuel consumption
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.420]   and use in the body generally,
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.960]   not just about body mass indexes and things of that sort.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.780]   So let's talk about selenium because it's really important.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.460]   And even though most people are getting
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.660]   a lot of sufficient iodine
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.260]   and most people are probably getting enough L-tyrosine,
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.520]   I'm guessing most people may not be getting enough selenium
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.800]   if their goal is to increase thyroid hormone,
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.060]   at least that's what the literature says.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.480]   Without going into the biochemistry,
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.900]   selenium is important in order for thyroid hormone
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.960]   to be made because of the way that it allows L-tyrosine
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.480]   and iodine to interact.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.120]   And the thing is most people aren't getting enough selenium
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.040]   because they don't eat foods that are high in selenium.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.600]   Now, how much selenium you need
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.880]   will depend on where you live.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.920]   It actually varies country by country.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.640]   Some countries I found say that you should get
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.560]   100 micrograms, some say 200, some say 155.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.720]   The average was about 155 micrograms,
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.340]   the countries I looked at.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.740]   People who are trying to increase thyroid levels
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.960]   might want to consume more selenium.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.500]   And if you consume a vitamin, of course,
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.320]   you want to make sure if it has selenium
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.240]   that you're not overdoing it
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.080]   by consuming a lot of selenium-rich foods either.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.340]   But nonetheless, I think it's fair to say
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.920]   that most people probably could do well
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.020]   by ingesting slightly more selenium than they currently are,
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.220]   although, of course, always talk to your doctor.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.740]   Brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion of foods
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.440]   to get selenium from.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.660]   It has very high concentrations of selenium.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.100]   In just six or eight, Brazil nuts contain
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.400]   something like 550 micrograms of selenium.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.240]   It's also present in fish.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.940]   So certain fish like yellowfin tuna,
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.140]   although nowadays, whenever I mentioned tuna or shellfish,
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.860]   which is the other rich source of selenium,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.060]   people will tell me immediately there are all sorts
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.100]   of issues around farm, not farm, mercury, et cetera.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.200]   So I've never particularly liked eating fish
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.600]   'cause of the way it tastes.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.740]   So that's why I avoid it.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.880]   But for those of you that like it,
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.460]   I'm sure you're much more skilled in knowing
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.580]   which fish to buy and which fish not to buy.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.780]   Ham, of all things, contains a lot of selenium.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.480]   For whatever reason, pork does.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.220]   I'm not a big consumer of pork.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.740]   Beef has some selenium, but what's interesting,
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.360]   if you look at the sources, pork, beef, turkey, chicken,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.620]   cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice,
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.020]   what you want to understand is that Brazil nuts,
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.940]   six to eight Brazil nuts has 550 micrograms of selenium
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.060]   and all the other foods I mentioned
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.660]   at much greater portion size than equivalent
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.740]   to six to eight Brazil nuts,
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.660]   either by volume or by calories,
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.540]   they have something like 30 to 50 micrograms of selenium.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.820]   So if you're not eating Brazil nuts,
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.400]   and I'm guessing most people aren't,
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.140]   and you're not eating a lot of animal-based foods,
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.700]   which I know many of you aren't,
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.860]   then you're probably not getting enough selenium.
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.300]   And again, you can have these levels measured
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.620]   or you can just check what you're consuming
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.360]   and figure out whether or not you're meeting the ration
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.860]   that you need in order to get healthy levels of thyroid.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.280]   It is present in things like mushrooms,
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.920]   but again, in a bowl of mushrooms,
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.940]   what is the equivalent to a bowl of mushrooms?
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.580]   12 micrograms of selenium.
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.180]   And if the daily ration is something
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.480]   in the 100 to 200 range,
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.140]   again, look it up for the area you are,
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.180]   you can see really quickly why,
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.180]   even though things like mushrooms and spinach
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.060]   and milk and yogurt and lentils and cashews,
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.340]   and now we're into the vegetarian segment
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.020]   in the list that I constructed,
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.740]   you're probably not getting enough selenium.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.920]   So it's kind of an interesting thing
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.360]   if you're an experimenter
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.140]   and you get the clearance from your doctor,
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.940]   you could try increasing your selenium levels
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.060]   and see how that impacts your metabolism.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.320]   Again, Brazil nuts are probably going to be
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.000]   the most direct way to get sufficient selenium levels,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.180]   but because levels are so high in Brazil nuts,
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.660]   it also means that you could overdo it as well.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.660]   I'm not really aware of what the consequences are
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.260]   of getting too much selenium,
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.940]   although you can get too much of anything
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.460]   and I'm guessing those consequences aren't good.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.580]   I also want to mention that for children,
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.660]   their daily requirements of selenium are much lower
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.660]   as low as 30 or 40 micrograms for kids 14 years or younger.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.940]   And in some areas, I really want to underscore this,
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.100]   the amount of selenium that's recommended daily
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.060]   is as low as 55 micrograms.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.980]   So it's not that you should be shooting for thousands
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.740]   or even high levels of hundreds of micrograms of selenium,
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.280]   and again, that's micrograms, not milligrams.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.600]   So again, look into what you need,
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.700]   but if you're somebody who's interested
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.700]   in keeping thyroid function healthy and productive,
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.780]   then you certainly want to make sure
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.900]   you're getting enough iodine,
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.780]   you're getting enough selenium,
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.580]   and you're getting enough l-tyrosine.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.060]   And it's interesting when you start looking
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.940]   at the various foods, especially highly processed foods,
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.800]   then you start to realize that perhaps many people,
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.500]   maybe you, are not.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.780]   Not incidentally, selenium has some other effects on health
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.420]   that can be quite positive.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.160]   And even though these don't relate to thyroid
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.380]   or growth hormone function specifically,
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.260]   I think you might want to know about them
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.360]   given that we're on the topic of selenium.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.660]   The first is that there are three studies,
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.340]   all of which showed very high efficacy
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.140]   for reducing the risk of something called pre-eclampsia.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.800]   Excuse me, pre-eclampsia.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   Pre-eclampsia is seizures that are related
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.560]   to blood pressure issues during
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.200]   or around the delivery of a new baby.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.860]   And it actually, it's a rare-ish condition,
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.740]   but it actually can be quite deadly.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.840]   And so the fact that selenium is important
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.800]   for offsetting pre-eclampsia risk is interesting.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.580]   I don't know the exact mechanism,
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.460]   and I'm guessing there are only a few of you out there
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.160]   that are either pregnant or thinking of conceiving soon,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.440]   but that's worth noting.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.540]   Obviously, anything related to pregnancy or lactation,
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.040]   especially talk to your doctor.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.860]   I'm guessing that selenium is probably
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.540]   in a lot of prenatal formulas,
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:10.540]   but that's one clear benefit of having sufficient selenium.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.140]   The other is a reduced prostate cancer risk.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.100]   There's a study showing that having sufficient selenium
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.200]   can reduce prostate cancer risk.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.540]   And there is some evidence that if you consume foods
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.420]   from areas with soil that's low in selenium,
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.760]   that can be a problem.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.860]   And last episode, we talked about all these issues
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.940]   related to soil quality,
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.320]   things that are making their way into food
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.020]   that are disrupting hormones and so forth.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:40.260]   But having sufficient selenium from food
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.600]   could offset the low content in any soil.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.800]   And so that apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.740]   It's a minor effect,
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.080]   but it's a statistically significant one.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.440]   And the other one is a reduction in acne,
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.280]   which is interesting.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.680]   I'm guessing that that probably has to do
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.220]   with the thyroid hormone pathway
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.080]   because of the way thyroid hormone can impact the liver.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.780]   And then it turns out that the liver and various
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.380]   biochemical reactions in the liver can impact acne.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.700]   And that's probably an episode all into itself,
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.100]   but those are just some additional benefits
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.180]   of getting sufficient selenium.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.440]   Okay, so we're already deep into tools related
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.920]   to making sure that you have sufficient selenium,
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.220]   iodine, and L-tyrosine in order to make enough
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:28.620]   thyroid hormones that can support your metabolic processes
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.460]   in your liver, your muscles, your tendons,
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.660]   for whatever purpose, keeping your metabolism high,
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.480]   for body composition reasons, or for healing,
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.780]   for keeping your brain working well.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.540]   Earlier I mentioned there are people
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.680]   who are following very clean diets.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.640]   So these are people that consume no processed foods.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.720]   Any starch they might eat is going to be
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.280]   maybe a rice or a grain,
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.620]   or any protein they might consume is going to be
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.980]   either from, let's hope, from humanely raised animal sources
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.460]   or maybe they're pure plant-based.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.480]   Believe it or not, those folks are actually
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.900]   very susceptible to low iodine,
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:13.720]   because it turns out that diets that are very meat rich
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.300]   and don't have many vegetables,
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.120]   as well as diets that are very vegetable rich,
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.100]   but don't have many meats or salts,
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.300]   are at risk of lowering thyroid hormone
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.900]   by way of the iodine pathway and other pathways.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.700]   And so let me try and simplify this for you.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.780]   Chances are, if people are doing the all meat diet,
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.700]   they're not sprinkling,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.540]   they're not wrapping those steaks in seaweed,
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.220]   and they may or may not be supplementing with iodine.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.000]   Chances are they're probably consuming iodine salt,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.400]   but their requirements go up
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.840]   if they're not consuming vegetables.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.620]   People who are consuming vegetables,
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.460]   it's kind of interesting,
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.540]   we always hear that we should have
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.700]   our cruciferous vegetables, and those are so important,
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.020]   but they're actually substances, compounds,
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.780]   within high quality cruciferous vegetables
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.660]   that can interfere with thyroid hormone function.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.980]   So if you're eating a lot of that stuff,
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.620]   a lot of cabbages, and just look up your other,
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.580]   I think broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable,
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.900]   and I won't read off the whole list,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.860]   you could just put into the internet.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.820]   But if you're, we're always told to eat
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.540]   a lot of the dark leafy green stuff.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.540]   Well, unless that dark leafy green stuff is kelp or seaweed,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.940]   chances are that we're not getting enough iodine
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.360]   unless we're adding salt to our food.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.780]   And chances are that we may be lowering
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.900]   the total amount of thyroid that we're making,
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.920]   as well as the fact that in plant-rich diets,
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.700]   it's hard to get enough L-tyrosine.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.240]   And I don't want, I'm not here to inflame
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.020]   any of the vegans or the carnivore folks.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.340]   I don't take a stance either way on any of that.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.940]   I'm just learning, trying to report the science.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.700]   The point I want to make is your health is important.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.700]   So if you are purely plant-based
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.400]   and you're eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables,
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.200]   make sure you're getting enough iodine.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.360]   It does seem like the cruciferous vegetables
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.480]   can increase the need for further iodine.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.220]   And same thing if you're purely,
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.660]   and you're on this all meat diet or your keto,
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.940]   and you're not ingesting many vegetables.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.080]   So I always thought that the cleaner the diet, the better,
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.980]   but it turns, and probably that's true
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.240]   from the standpoint of hormone regulation,
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.680]   estrogen and testosterone and other hormones.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.460]   The highly processed foods really are terrible.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.040]   There's so much evidence for that.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.720]   The phthalates in plastics and the processed foods
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.640]   and the emulsifiers,
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.840]   all the stuff we talked about previous episode.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.380]   But it does seem to be that people
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.160]   that are not getting enough iodine for whatever reason,
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.220]   really need to check out whether or not
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.440]   their iodine levels need to be increased
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.200]   because of the fact that they're consuming so many plants
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.500]   or so many meats, and in some cases,
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.720]   plants that actually lower thyroid hormone.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.420]   And not to beat a dead horse or cabbage,
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.460]   but there are a number of things that iodine can do
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.960]   that are positive, that are sort of,
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.140]   they're related to thyroid, not directly.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.580]   They're kind of offshoots of the thyroid pathway.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.960]   They're downstream of it, we would say,
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.380]   in terms of how they impact metabolic function.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.280]   One of those is to reduce something
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.880]   called C-reactive protein.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.920]   Some of you may have heard of CRP or C-reactive protein.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.960]   C-reactive protein is something that you want to keep
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.880]   at modestly low levels.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.360]   It's associated with inflammation
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.840]   and various forms of heart disease
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.580]   and even eye disease, macular degeneration.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.060]   So it does appear that iodine supplementation
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.680]   or getting sufficient iodine from food either works,
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:39.320]   is associated with reduced levels of C-reactive protein
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.580]   in the blood and an anti-inflammatory effect.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.960]   And the anti-inflammatory effect brings us back
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.760]   to our old friend interleukin-6.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.440]   Remember, there are these inflammatory cytokines.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.140]   They have many, many names
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.000]   because there are many, many of them.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.280]   Interleukin-10 is the one that's anti-inflammatory.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   Interleukin-6 is the one that's inflammatory.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.400]   Anytime you see IL-6,
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.140]   that usually means that there's an inflammatory response.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.280]   There's a wound, there's inflammation of the brain.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.120]   Somebody is either sleep deprived or had a brain injury,
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.960]   or they're dealing with some sort of infection.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.080]   IL-6 is kind of a catchall for inflammation.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.040]   And it does appear that iodine supplementation
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.100]   can reduce circulating IL-6 associated with inflammation.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.520]   So in that sense, iodine can have
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.280]   an anti-inflammatory effect.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.640]   So by now, it should be abundantly clear,
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.200]   if you care about thyroid hormone,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.920]   if you care about the pathways that it impacts,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.480]   like having a high level of metabolism,
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.280]   which I guess if for no other reason is attractive,
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.540]   'cause then you can eat more
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.740]   and still maintain a healthy body composition,
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.180]   but also for brain health, cognitive function,
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.260]   tissue repair, all that stuff,
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:52.120]   keeping C-reactive protein low, keeping IL-6 low,
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.960]   make sure you're getting enough
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.200]   iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.520]   If you're curious how thyroid actually increases metabolism,
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.900]   allows you to eat more, et cetera,
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.160]   it relates to something we covered last issue,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.620]   which is glucose.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.820]   Remember, when you eat something, blood sugar goes up,
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.300]   insulin is secreted from the pancreas,
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.420]   and it makes sure that blood glucose doesn't go too high,
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.440]   which can damage tissues, or too low,
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.100]   which can make you hypoglycemic.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:19.060]   Thyroid increases glucose uptake by various tissues,
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.320]   in particular muscle and bone.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.680]   It actually can increase bone mineral density,
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.000]   which is a really good thing as you get older.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.080]   Injuries, when I say older, I mean basically 30 and older.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.800]   The reason you can recover more quickly from injuries
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.280]   if you have a healthy thyroid and healthy thyroid pathways
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.700]   is because you can consume energy,
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.780]   that energy is diverted toward bone repair
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.860]   and muscle repair and cartilage repair.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.760]   And so the way it does this again is by increasing ATP,
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.760]   but the whole idea here is that iodine, selenium,
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.380]   L-tyrosine allow thyroid to be at healthy levels
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.720]   so that thyroid then can take glucose in the blood
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.280]   and divert it to tissues for it to be used,
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.540]   in particular your brain.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.360]   And that's why these things that we're talking about
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.700]   supplementing or getting from food
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.900]   can actually improve or support brain function.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.920]   People are always asking me,
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.820]   what is the food that I should eat for my brain?
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.440]   Like, are blueberries good for your brain?
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.820]   Or they do ask me, are walnuts good for your brain?
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.180]   'Cause it looks like a brain.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.540]   We talked about that earlier.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.000]   The fact of the matter is that what you need are nutrients
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.820]   that support hormones and biological pathways
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.720]   that support the brain.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.920]   That's the way to think about it.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.180]   And I realized when people ask,
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.640]   what should I eat to support my brain?
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.720]   That's basically what they're asking in short form.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.980]   So keeping your thyroid hormone healthy,
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.680]   at healthy levels that is,
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.500]   is going to be terrific for your brain
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.660]   because 75% of your metabolism is from your brain.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.220]   The ability of your brain to use glucose or ketones
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.020]   for that matter is going to be aided
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.180]   by having healthy thyroid.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.480]   So do the things, take the things,
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.340]   eat the things that are going to allow you
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.980]   to have healthy levels of thyroid hormone.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:00.800]   I'm sure a number of you are out there wondering,
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.280]   do I have healthy levels of thyroid hormone?
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.840]   Those can be measured from the blood.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.520]   There's some telltale signs of having really high thyroid
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.160]   or really low thyroid.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.560]   And I could start listing those off.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.560]   They're easy to find online as well.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.320]   Things like bulging eyes, inability to maintain weight,
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.620]   shaky, anxiety, that's kind of hyperthyroidal,
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.520]   thinning of hair, this kind of thing.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.720]   I don't want to get into diagnosing hypothyroidism
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.840]   and hyperthyroidism.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.300]   It's just impossible 'cause you're there and I'm here
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.540]   and we're kind of shouting back and forth
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.400]   through a tunnel of video and comments.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.120]   If you're concerned about having excessively high
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.600]   or excessively low levels of thyroid hormone,
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.960]   absolutely look up what the symptoms are,
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.880]   talk to your physician.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.560]   And there are a number of good treatments.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.360]   I didn't talk about prescription drugs
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.720]   that can improve symptoms related to hypo or hyperthyroid.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.200]   Of course, they have synthesized thyroid.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.720]   So if you don't make enough thyroid, you can take thyroid.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.160]   It's by prescription.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.180]   If you have too much thyroid,
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.640]   sometimes they'll take out the thyroid gland
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.240]   or they can administer drugs that will
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.240]   either block receptors or will interfere
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.120]   with some of the pathways from the brain to the pituitary
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.960]   or from the pituitary to the thyroid
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.720]   in order to adjust thyroid hormone that way.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.120]   So there are the big guns in terms of the treatments
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.080]   for different thyroid disorders,
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.000]   but we're not talking about thyroid disorders.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.340]   We're talking about how to get and maintain thyroid levels
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.300]   in healthy ranges and some straightforward ways to do that
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.720]   through diet and supplementation.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   There's also a lot of evidence that for people
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.600]   who menstruate, levels of thyroid hormone
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.540]   can fluctuate dramatically across the menstrual cycle.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.820]   So that's really going to be a process of experimentation.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.460]   I don't know that you could, in theory,
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.280]   take blood at different phases of your cycle
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.080]   and figure out whether or not your thyroid hormone
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.240]   was excessively high or low
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.680]   at different phases of the cycle.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.520]   That's going to be pretty tough to do.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.920]   If you have an endocrinologist
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.360]   that's willing to do that with you, terrific.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.700]   I think most people are going to have to figure out
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.600]   how supplementing the sorts of things
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.100]   that we talked about before or getting them from foods
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.320]   relates to different aspects of their cycle.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.260]   In general, the first half of the cycle before ovulation,
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.620]   people crave carbohydrates and sweets more related to the,
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.440]   and that makes total sense
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.340]   based on the biology of the menstrual cycle.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.840]   Thyroid hormone is going to go up as you, as anyone,
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.820]   male or female, menstruating or not,
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.520]   increases more starchy carbohydrates.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.320]   This is interesting because ketogenic diets
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.620]   have been shown to slightly lower thyroid levels,
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.940]   and that makes sense because in ketogenic diets,
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.160]   blood glucose levels are very low
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.900]   and thyroid hormone is secreted in large part
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:48.040]   in proportion to how much glucose is in the bloodstream
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.320]   and how much that glucose, excuse me,
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.760]   needs to be regulated.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.020]   So I'm not trying to demonize the ketogenic diet.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.380]   I think it definitely has its place.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.640]   There are 22 studies now
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.920]   showing that it can dramatically reduce blood glucose,
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.720]   and about a third of those show
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.120]   that thyroid hormone levels are slightly reduced,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.800]   sometimes significantly, if not more,
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.520]   in the ketogenic diet.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.580]   That may explain, I want to highlight may,
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.800]   explain the fact that when people go back
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.280]   to a more traditional diet,
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.680]   if they've been on a ketogenic diet for a long time,
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.960]   that oftentimes they will gain weight very quickly
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.600]   as they bring carbohydrates back into their diet.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.360]   Some people are cycling between ketogenic
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.160]   and non-ketogenic every three, four days,
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.520]   so-called cyclic ketogenic diet.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.780]   Some people are staying ketogenic for long periods of time.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.420]   Some people, six days on, one day off.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.680]   So it was a huge variation there.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.360]   The point is that carbohydrates,
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.840]   starchy carbohydrates in particular,
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.480]   support the healthy production of T3 and T4.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.500]   And so if you're very low carbohydrate,
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.240]   you're going to have a reduction in T3 and T4.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.160]   And so if you're going to bring carbohydrates
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.320]   back into your diet,
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.760]   then you might want to do it more gradually.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.400]   And for those of you that menstruate
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.520]   and are craving carbohydrates
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.700]   in the early part of the cycle,
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.960]   that is actually associated with having a healthy cycle.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:10.020]   If any of you have had a healthy cycle on a ketogenic diet,
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:10.860]   that would be interesting.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.460]   Maybe let me know through the comments
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.400]   or point me in the direction of some research
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.500]   if you're aware of it.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.440]   So as you can start to see,
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.080]   there's this really beautiful interplay
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.200]   between the different hormones,
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.020]   between insulin and glucose,
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.800]   between estrogen and thyroid,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.240]   between thyroid and blood glucose and the ketogenic diets.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.760]   It all starts to fit together
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.560]   in ways that make a lot of sense
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.640]   once you understand just kind of the core elements
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.720]   of what the hormones are
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.980]   and the variety of tissues that they work on.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.380]   The simple version of this is
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.380]   if you haven't had a carbohydrate for a year,
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.860]   then your T3, T4 levels are going to be pretty low.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.660]   And I'm sure there's some ketonistas out there.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.500]   They're going to say,
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.040]   "Wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go up with keto."
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.640]   That might be true for other reasons,
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.600]   indirect reasons related to hormone pathways
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.240]   that are cascade from being in ketosis
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.000]   for long periods of time, great.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.660]   But for most people that don't consume any carbohydrate,
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.240]   T3, T4 are going to go down.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.480]   And when they start to consume foods
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.920]   that require thyroid metabolism
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.680]   in order to work with, to metabolize,
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.820]   then weight gain can sometimes happen more quickly.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.520]   So it's just something to consider
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.840]   and it's something to work with carefully
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.280]   if you're going to be cyclic ketogenic, long-term ketogenic.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.480]   And if you're not ketogenic
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.000]   and you're consuming carbohydrates
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.460]   and the three things that we talked about earlier,
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.540]   selenium, tyrosine, and iodine,
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:35.180]   chances are, unless there's an underlying condition there,
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.340]   that your levels of thyroid
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.180]   are going to be in healthy range.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.100]   Next, we're going to talk about growth hormone.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.760]   Growth hormone has received a ton of attention
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.060]   in the last 20 years.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.320]   I actually remember when it was first sequenced.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.160]   This was a huge deal.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.560]   There was a huge patent drama.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.780]   I won't mention the universities or the people involved.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.300]   There were companies and monster patents and payouts.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.700]   And it was really interesting.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.820]   You can look that up online if you're interested
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.640]   in some of the scientific history.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.460]   Growth hormone is a pretty straightforward one
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:05.460]   for you to understand now
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:09.260]   because it follows the exact same logic as thyroid hormone.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.740]   In fact, their functions are so closely overlapping
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.820]   when we first look at the face of it
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.020]   that you're probably going to think,
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.660]   why do you have these two systems?
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:23.660]   So just very briefly, growth hormone releasing hormone,
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.820]   so remember, releasing means it comes from the brain,
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.100]   comes from the brain and tells the pituitary
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.580]   to release growth hormone.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.740]   And then growth hormone is released into the bloodstream
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.000]   where it goes and acts on a ton of tissues,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.380]   muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et cetera,
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.940]   to increase metabolism.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:43.420]   It sounds just like thyroid hormone
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.780]   and they do work in parallel.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.020]   And that's why we've lumped them together
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:46.860]   in the same episode.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:50.400]   They increase metabolism and repair and growth of tissues.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.740]   A conversation about growth hormone would be incomplete
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.620]   if we didn't talk about the kind of extremes.
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.140]   There are certain people who are born
[00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.200]   that don't make enough growth hormone
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.060]   and they end up very short in stature.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.940]   There are certain people who make a ton of growth hormone
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.860]   and they end up very, very large.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.140]   They tend to have very large appendages.
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.140]   They have something called acromegaly.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.700]   It's kind of like a ridging of the forehead.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.700]   It's actually a bone ridge.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:21.380]   They are giant and it used to be called giantism.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:26.260]   And most people, of course, are in a range of height
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.220]   and appendage length that doesn't imply
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.920]   that there's a growth hormone disruption there.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.680]   Growth hormone received a lot of attention
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.780]   after it was sequenced because that meant the opportunity
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.220]   to inject growth hormone and replace growth hormone
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.060]   that was lost.
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.860]   And there was actually a lot of cases
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:46.380]   of people taking their kids
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.700]   and trying to get them to be taller for whatever reason
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.740]   by injecting growth hormone.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.360]   Today, we're going to talk about the things
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.060]   that anyone can do to increase growth hormone.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.820]   And there are reasons why certain people
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:58.660]   would want to do that.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.100]   People who overproduce growth hormone
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.360]   certainly would not want to do that.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.340]   People who underproduce it would probably want to do that.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:09.000]   People that make normal quote unquote levels
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.400]   of growth hormone might want to do that as they age
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.940]   because during puberty and development,
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.780]   the pituitary is churning out tons of growth hormone.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.780]   It's responsible for the growth, not surprising,
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.540]   of the body and all its features,
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.180]   height just being one of those.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.020]   And so as we age, we make less growth hormone.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.000]   And that is one of the reasons
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.180]   why we recover more slowly from injuries.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.540]   It's one of the reasons why we accumulate body fat.
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:40.220]   And it's one of the reasons why our metabolism slows.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.740]   And so growth hormone replacement therapy
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.620]   has been tremendously popular in the last 20 years,
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.500]   which is not to say it doesn't carry its problems, it does.
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.200]   Here's one of the major problems
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.460]   with injecting growth hormone.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.900]   Not saying people shouldn't do this
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.300]   if the doctor has approved it
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.980]   or it's in keeping with their particular life goals,
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:04.400]   but growth hormone, if it's in levels that are too high,
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.500]   will cause growth of all tissues.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.100]   So not just muscle, not just reduction in body fat
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:15.540]   by metabolizing, by allowing fatty acids
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.140]   to be pulled out of storage and used for ATP,
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:22.220]   but it will also cause increase in growth of the heart
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.620]   and the lungs and the liver and the spleen.
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.060]   And so this is the concern with abuse of growth hormone.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:28.900]   So we're not going to be talking
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.100]   about abuse of growth hormone.
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.660]   We will, however, talk about tools that anyone can use
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.860]   to increase levels of growth hormone.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:36.900]   Some of them are behavioral,
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.580]   some of them are supplement-based,
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:42.240]   and some of them interact with behaviors and supplements.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.340]   And what's cool about the discussion about growth hormone
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.740]   is that the tools that exist out there
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.900]   to increase growth hormone are very actionable.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.340]   Most people can do these without the need for any equipment
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.380]   or even any supplement,
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.860]   although there are some supplement-related themes
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.040]   for tools for growth hormone increase.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:03.620]   And also the increases that one can get in growth hormone
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:05.180]   are substantial.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.440]   So normally when you talk about the difference
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.300]   between taking something as an exogenous substance
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.840]   like testosterone or estrogen
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   versus using supplements or behaviors to increase them,
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.200]   you're talking about tenfold differences
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.940]   from administering the prescription compound.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.880]   In terms of growth hormone,
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.960]   there are things that can increase growth hormone
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.060]   three, four, 500% or more.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.200]   And even though that's a short-lived increase,
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.440]   they can have very powerful effects on metabolism
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.840]   and on repair of tissues.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.440]   So let's talk about those.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.460]   Okay, let's go step by step
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.640]   in terms of the things that anyone,
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.140]   perhaps everyone should be doing
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.980]   in order to maintain healthy growth hormone levels
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.180]   or increase growth hormone levels.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:51.220]   Unless you have overproduction of growth hormone,
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:54.280]   chances are these things are going to benefit you.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.960]   However, as always, I want to emphasize,
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.700]   talk to a doctor before you do anything,
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.300]   including remove any treatments.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.100]   So anything you would add or take away,
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.220]   that's a responsibility of you and your healthcare provider.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.780]   Okay, I don't just say that to protect me,
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.920]   I say that to protect you.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.400]   First of all, growth hormone is released every night
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.540]   when you go to sleep,
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.120]   and it's released in the early part of sleep
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.040]   during so-called slow wave sleep.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:25.760]   So the two conditions that have to be met
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.160]   in order for growth hormone to be secreted regularly
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.600]   for tissue repair, et cetera,
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.560]   are you need to get into slow wave sleep,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.480]   the so-called deep sleep,
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:40.120]   and you need blood insulin and glucose
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.760]   to be relatively low.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.720]   So eating within two hours of sleep,
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.280]   excuse me, eating within two hours of going to sleep
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.160]   is going to suppress growth hormone release.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.660]   That's very clear.
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.920]   However, some people are going to have problems
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.440]   falling asleep if they are too hungry.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.920]   So you have to work with that
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.480]   and decide what you're going to eat
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.380]   and when you're going to eat that thing
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.600]   so that you're not so hungry
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.800]   that you're having trouble falling asleep.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.620]   The episodes on sleep that were covered
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.000]   in episodes two, three, and four
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.740]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.120]   has I believe more tools there than you could ever want
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.420]   or make use of in terms of how to optimize sleep.
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.580]   So you can refer to those if you like.
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.800]   So don't eat too close to sleep
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.400]   and then get into slow wave sleep.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.300]   And as I've talked about in one of those earlier episodes,
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.780]   the first half of the night,
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.340]   slow wave sleep and deep sleep predominate.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.240]   The second half of the night,
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.860]   it's another kind of sleep we call REM sleep.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:36.020]   So what is special about this early phase of sleep?
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.340]   This is how you should be thinking
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:39.180]   if you listen to this podcast.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.360]   You should be thinking, okay,
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.920]   I hear that something is important,
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.520]   it's related, it's in the pathway,
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.660]   but mechanistically when we say get into slow wave sleep,
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.020]   get into deep sleep,
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.940]   that's when growth hormone is secreted.
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.700]   The question you should be asking yourselves
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:55.780]   as scientists of yourselves is,
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.620]   wait, why slow wave sleep?
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.440]   What in particular about slow wave deep sleep
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.340]   allows the pituitary to release growth hormone?
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.380]   Like what is it?
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.240]   Because if you can understand that,
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.440]   if you can understand a little bit of mechanism,
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.780]   there are actually ways
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:15.240]   that you can increase the amount of growth hormone
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.220]   that you release both in sleep and out of sleep.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:22.580]   So the answer is it's delta wave activity in the brain.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:26.280]   Delta waves are these big giant waves of activity
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.880]   in the brain that correlate with slow wave sleep
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.500]   as opposed to faster waves of activity
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.420]   that is associated with rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.760]   So slow wave sleep and the delta activity
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:40.760]   actually triggers the neurons in the brain,
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.540]   the releasing hormone, right?
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:44.340]   Growth hormone releasing hormone neurons
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.020]   to signal to the pituitary.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.280]   Now, how do I know this is true?
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.200]   And what can you do with this?
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.100]   Well, we know this is true
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.140]   because researchers have taken people
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:54.060]   and sleep deprived them and they just asked,
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.060]   well, is it just one period of time every 24 hours
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:59.220]   and then the pituitary releases growth hormone?
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:00.460]   If that were the case,
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.640]   that would say that growth hormone is just released
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.340]   in a so-called circadian dependent way.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.540]   Every 24 hours, there's the pulse of it,
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:11.260]   but no, it's always relating to slow wave deep sleep
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.380]   and delta waves.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.860]   And this is cool because what it means is that
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.980]   even if you're not measuring your brain waves during sleep,
[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.440]   which most of you probably are not,
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.580]   you might be measuring slow wave sleep or deep sleep
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.020]   using a device like a whoop or an aura.
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.180]   And even if you're not,
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.460]   what this means is that during the day,
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.180]   there's the potential to also increase
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.460]   growth hormone release if you can get the brain
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.420]   into the so-called delta waves.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:38.260]   And it turns out there are things you can do
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.260]   in waking as well to increase growth hormone release.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.860]   So we're going to talk about those next,
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:45.260]   but as a tool and to just really make sure
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.180]   that we put brackets around this,
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.340]   try and have blood glucose not too high.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.820]   So if you do need to eat close to bed,
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:51.980]   you wouldn't want to eat anything
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.580]   that would increase blood glucose too much.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.040]   Try and not eat too close to bedtime,
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.980]   get into deep sleep early in the night,
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:00.940]   get the growth hormone release
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.940]   and understand that it's the delta waves of activity,
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:06.140]   these sweeping big waves of activity in the neurons
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:08.860]   that stimulate the brain to stimulate the pituitary.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.540]   'Cause once you understand that,
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.080]   then you have something to anchor to in terms of thinking,
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.780]   what are the things I can do in waking
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:18.160]   that will allow me to release more growth hormone,
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.940]   which for most people is going to be a good thing.
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.580]   Several times before on this podcast,
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:25.900]   I've talked about the fact that I'm not a big fan
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:30.220]   of melatonin supplementation for most purposes.
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:34.200]   It might be helpful under conditions of jet lag.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.220]   However, there are a lot of reasons why
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.240]   I personally don't like melatonin.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.000]   It interacts with the reproductive hormones,
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.380]   testosterone and estrogen,
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:45.500]   and that whole axis in ways that are unattractive,
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.720]   at least to me, it suppresses puberty during development.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:53.080]   It's present in much, much higher doses in most supplements
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:57.200]   than one would normally make, like 100 fold, 300 fold.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   However, today I'm going to talk about an instance
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:03.840]   where very low levels of melatonin supplementation
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.120]   might actually be advantageous.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.860]   And that is aiding the transition
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.040]   to the delta wave slow wave sleep I just described,
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.980]   because that's the pattern of sleep
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:17.900]   and brainwave activity that triggers growth hormone release.
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:21.500]   So whereas most melatonin supplements are one milligram,
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.880]   three milligrams, 12 milligrams, this kind of thing,
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.300]   that is super physiological.
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.260]   There are some data showing that microgram,
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:35.260]   maybe 500 micrograms of melatonin, so half a milligram,
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:38.920]   can be beneficial in shifting the pattern
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:39.960]   of early night sleep
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.600]   toward more of the slow wave deep sleep delta activity
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.880]   and improving growth hormone release.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:49.560]   Not a lot of studies, but the ones that I saw are quality.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.180]   They were done in subjects that, you know,
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:55.620]   both sexes, sufficient numbers, et cetera.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:56.540]   So this is interesting.
[00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.000]   So if you're interested in melatonin supplementation,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.820]   you might think about it just at very low levels, you know,
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.960]   hundreds of micrograms as opposed to the milligram dosages.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.400]   Most of the ones out there
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.260]   are going to be in milligram dosages.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.620]   So that's one way that some studies have shown
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.040]   that you can increase the amount of growth hormone
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.940]   that's secreted in early phases of sleep.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.660]   Now, the delta wave activity
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.280]   and the slow wave activity in the brain
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.340]   being very important for growth hormone release
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.400]   and growth hormone release being so important
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.360]   for metabolic functions and peeling away unwanted body fat
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.840]   and repairing tissues, et cetera, forces us to ask,
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.360]   well, what other things can we do in waking
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.940]   in order to increase growth hormone release?
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.040]   So let's start with the ones
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.480]   that have a potentially big effect,
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.360]   but are a little bit harder to access.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.160]   And for that, I want to point toward a book,
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.680]   which is really kind of interesting.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.440]   It's not focused on growth hormone,
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.940]   but the book is called "Altered Traits."
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.440]   This is the book.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.240]   It's an excellent book.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.060]   "Altered Traits" by Goleman and Davidson.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.180]   "Science Reveals How Meditation Changes
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.360]   "Your Mind, Brain, and Body."
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.080]   Very interesting book.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.520]   For those of you that are interested in meditation,
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.140]   and perhaps those of you who are not,
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.240]   but are considering it,
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.200]   what they talk about in this book is the fact
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.120]   that meditation has two separate lines of effects.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.380]   One of those lines of effects
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.200]   are things that change your state.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.880]   So you're stressed, you sit down, you meditate,
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.840]   and you relax, and you go into a particular state.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.620]   The other are the changes that occur over time,
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.600]   and those are changes in trait.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.680]   So personality can actually change
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   with long bouts of TM meditation or repeated meditation.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.080]   In any case, the reason we're talking
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.080]   about altered traits today is because certain types
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.640]   of meditation can get people's brains into states
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.560]   that very closely mimic slow wave sleep.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.640]   If you hear snoring in the background, Costello is,
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.440]   it sounds like he's in slow wave sleep,
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.280]   these big oscillatory snores
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.920]   that he's in 23.6 hours per day.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.560]   So what this means is for people
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.560]   that are interested in increasing growth hormone,
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.580]   a meditation practice that allows you
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:20.580]   to get into these slow wave delta-type frequency activity
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.760]   in the brain may be very beneficial
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.880]   because as I mentioned before,
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.040]   that's what's gating growth hormone release.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.880]   It's not just a circadian phenomenon.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.960]   It's actually controlled by these brain waves.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.920]   I did look up binaural beats.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.940]   I get so many questions about binaural beats,
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.560]   and it's a really attractive idea, right?
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.900]   Binaural beats, for those of you who don't know,
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.520]   you listen to one frequency of tone, do, do, do, do, do,
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.560]   in one ear and another frequency of tone in the other ear,
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.240]   do, do, do, and then the brain essentially
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.080]   takes the average of the two,
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.840]   or there's some other wiring in the brainstem
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.040]   that makes it not quite the average,
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.560]   but takes the average of the two for sake of discussion,
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.280]   and that frequency is what the brain entrains
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.900]   or maps onto.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.800]   There are a lot of apps that are claiming
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   that you can get the brain into delta waves
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.880]   using binaural beats.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.840]   I could not find quality peer review studies
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.900]   supporting that, but I know there are a lot of fans
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.200]   out there of binaural beats.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.520]   If you know of any literature that's independent
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.660]   of the company that makes the binaural beat technology,
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.960]   so unbiased research, please send it my way,
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.960]   but in "Altered Traits," Goleman and Davidson talk about
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.320]   the fact that people who do 20 minutes
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.920]   of sitting meditation per day
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.920]   can access these slow wave sleep-like brain states.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.360]   Now, I've talked a lot on here about non-sleep deep rest,
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.600]   things like yoga nidra and hypnosis.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.560]   I'm not aware that those will put people
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.840]   into slow wave sleep per se, or delta waves per se,
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.400]   so we're really talking about 20 minutes
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.240]   of more traditional type meditation.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.700]   Okay, so we talked about very low doses of melatonin
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.200]   as a way to trigger delta waves
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.600]   and more growth hormone release in sleep.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.840]   There's science to support that.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.100]   We've now talked about a waking behavior of 20 minutes
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.000]   of sort of what I would call standard meditation
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   of just sitting there, concentrating on one's breathing
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.880]   to try and access delta waves, binaural beats,
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.540]   no science yet, who knows?
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.280]   Maybe there's science to support it.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.900]   If you're aware of it, let me know.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.580]   Now let's move to the things that one can do
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:25.080]   that have been shown to have, let's just be honest,
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.900]   pretty enormous effects on growth hormone release in waking.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.880]   And these are things that are very actionable.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.240]   One of the things that can have a dramatic effect
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.080]   on levels of growth hormone release in waking,
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:42.020]   as well as in sleep the following night, is exercise.
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:46.600]   But the key is the type of exercise and the duration.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.880]   Now there's a logic to this.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.280]   There are hundreds, if not thousands of studies
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.400]   measuring growth hormone, both during
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.740]   or sometimes after exercise or the following night.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.160]   And the conclusion that one takes away from all of these
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.780]   is that exercise has to be of particular duration
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.780]   and intensity in order to get growth hormone release.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.480]   So first I'm just going to tell you what I found to be
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.880]   the maximum amount of growth hormone release
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.880]   as it relates to a particular form of exercise.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.200]   The particular form of exercise is either weight training
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.820]   or it can be endurance training,
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:28.160]   but the endurance training and the weight training
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.420]   actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes,
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.320]   not much longer.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.880]   Now this is important because it's been shown
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:40.080]   over and over again that if one exercise is too long
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.000]   with weights or endurance exercise,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.580]   that cortisol levels go high enough
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.500]   that it starts to inhibit the testosterone
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.660]   and even the estrogen pathways.
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.440]   This is why I believe people who over exercise
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.760]   or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles,
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.120]   they stop menstruating.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.040]   It's why you get suppressions and testosterone
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.360]   if people train too long and too hard.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.520]   The cutoff has always been 60 to 75 minutes
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.360]   of the hard work part.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.800]   It's going to vary a lot from person to person,
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.720]   but in terms of growth hormone,
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.520]   the conditions that seem to lead
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.520]   to the greatest growth hormone release are one, get warm.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.580]   This is interesting.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.400]   We're going to talk about temperature.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.980]   So a proper warmup seems to accelerate
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.840]   the release of growth hormone
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.240]   once the hard work phase starts.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:30.540]   So 10 minutes of warmup or so was the number
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.960]   that I extracted from all these studies.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.880]   There's a beautiful review on this by the way.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.940]   Growth hormone response is a varying, excuse me,
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.280]   growth hormone arginine and exercise.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.920]   We'll talk about arginine in a few minutes.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.900]   That's by Kannalee, K-A-N-A-L-E-Y.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.900]   It was published in Current Opinion
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.480]   in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Clear.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.640]   The Current Opinion journals are generally
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.120]   of pretty high quality in terms of the reviews,
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.800]   just because they tend to be pretty recent.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.140]   And then the references therein are also quite good.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.520]   So what does this mean?
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.880]   This means warm up.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.880]   And when you say warm up,
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.560]   it doesn't mean just warm up the limbs and tissues
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.100]   that you're going to use so you don't get injured,
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.960]   actually warm the body.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.540]   So there was actually some discussion
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.360]   about whether or not in cold winter months,
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.860]   people should wear like a stocking cap,
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:25.200]   bringing the conditions of making the room warm.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.380]   So getting the body warm as a warmup seems to be important
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.360]   because temperature of the body
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.600]   seems to be an important condition
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   or prerequisite for certain patterns of exercise
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.720]   to maximize growth hormone release.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.960]   So this is really interesting to me.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.920]   I have an obsession with how body temperature,
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.060]   light exercise and food interact.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.640]   We're going right there with the fact that if you get warm,
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.940]   you bring up the body temperature a degree or two
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.800]   or maybe three, and then start exercise.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.600]   It does appear that high intensity exercise,
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.160]   but again, as discussed in a previous episode,
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.200]   not exercise that brings muscles to failure,
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.240]   but close to it.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.080]   So if it's weight-bearing exercise,
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.120]   it would be getting close to that final repetitions
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.160]   where you can't complete them,
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.660]   but not pushing through those or even going to failure,
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:19.400]   but getting close leads to anywhere from 300 to 500%
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.940]   increases in resting growth hormone levels,
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:26.040]   and 300 to 500% increases in growth hormone
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.320]   the following night when you go to sleep,
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.220]   which is incredible.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.200]   Now, I want to dissect this properly, okay?
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.060]   So one of the other conditions that seemed to be important,
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:40.440]   again, was to have relatively low blood glucose.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.480]   So it's looking a lot like the conditions you need
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.120]   for sleep in order to get maximum growth hormone release
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:45.960]   in sleep.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.100]   So not having blood glucose too high or too low,
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.560]   that's a discussion unto itself.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.200]   You want to have sufficient energy to do the exercise,
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.760]   but getting warm, not having blood glucose too high
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   or too low, so probably not eating too close to exercise
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.260]   or not ingesting a lot of sugars during the exercise.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.260]   That was supported by the fact that ingestion
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:09.320]   of a sports drink that contains caloric sugar
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:12.200]   immediately flatlined the growth hormone levels.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.160]   So really interesting relationship
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.040]   between insulin, glucose, and growth hormone.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.360]   So then doing the training for anywhere from 60 to 75 minutes
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.040]   to maximize growth hormone release.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.880]   And then the other interesting thing
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.560]   was that even after the exercise,
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.480]   taking body temperature back down to normal levels
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.120]   relatively quickly seemed to be associated
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   with these big spikes in growth hormone.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.040]   Otherwise, what would happen is you get these big spikes
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.960]   in growth hormone, but if the exercise went too long
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.760]   or if body temperature remained too high for too long,
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.500]   then you didn't get the second increase in growth hormone
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.900]   the following night, okay?
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.720]   So I hope I made that abundantly clear.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.100]   Warm up well, get body temperature up,
[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.560]   exercise 60 to 75 minutes.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.060]   Don't go to absolute failure
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.820]   if your interest is in growth hormone release
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:04.180]   both during the exercise and later that night.
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:06.880]   And if you can bring body temperature
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.780]   back down to normal levels by cooling off,
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.040]   maybe cool shower or maybe ice pack or something,
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.960]   or maybe just turning off the heat in the room
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.820]   or going outside, whatever it is,
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.380]   then you increase the probability
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.680]   that you're going to increase growth hormone
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.540]   the following night as well.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:24.140]   And again, these are big increases, 300 to 500%.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.360]   It's almost like you're getting a second sleep during the day
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.920]   but if the exercise is too hard,
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.600]   if body temperature stays too high for too long,
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.160]   you disrupt the whole process
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.800]   and you don't get the effect of increased growth hormone.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.080]   Growth hormone is really powerful, but it doesn't work alone.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.880]   In fact, a lot of the effects of growth hormone
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.660]   are mediated by its effects on the liver.
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.560]   So growth hormone is released, goes to the liver
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.960]   and then the liver releases something called IGF-1,
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.400]   insulin growth factor one.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   Insulin growth factor one was popular
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.680]   in the neuroscience community as an area of focus
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.240]   because of its ability to trigger improvements
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.360]   in memory and learning after exercise.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.640]   And indeed, exercise triggers both the release
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.900]   of growth hormone and IGF-1.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.660]   IGF-1 seems responsible for a lot of the effects
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.560]   of improved memory.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:14.100]   Some people report that that is due to increased number
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.540]   of neurons or neurogenesis, birth of new neurons.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.180]   It's pretty clear that in humans,
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:19.820]   that's not what's happening.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.220]   Yes, in animals, not in humans.
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.440]   IGF-1 nonetheless has positive effects
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.240]   on memory and cognition.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.340]   And a great way to trigger IGF-1 release
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:30.480]   and growth hormone release is through exercise.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.460]   Now, the interesting thing,
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.000]   and the reason I'm bringing up IGF-1 here
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.460]   is that certain patterns of exercise,
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.340]   actually duration of exercise,
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:42.440]   have different effects on IGF-1 and growth hormone,
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.760]   depending on whether or not the exercise
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.560]   is done by men or women.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.500]   There's what we call a sex dependent effect.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.800]   And the sex dependent effect is as follows.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.960]   In this particular study and several others,
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.440]   what they did is they had people exercise,
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.720]   they measured growth hormone and IGF-1 levels
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:05.640]   from the blood before, during, and after exercise.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:08.340]   And they could see when the greatest increases occurred.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:11.720]   This was standard sorts of resistance exercise.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.720]   So some squats, there was a sprint-like activity.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.780]   It doesn't really matter what the specific exercises were.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.880]   None of them were to failure.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.580]   These were in kind of the 10 repetition or less range,
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.800]   six sets, so kind of standard weight training stuff
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.600]   that anyone might do.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.180]   But what was interesting is that women were able to access
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:38.020]   the biggest peak in growth hormone and IGF-1
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.920]   early in the exercise, so in the first 30 minutes.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.140]   So what this means is even if you just have 30 minutes,
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:48.860]   at least for women, there's going to be a big increase
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:51.000]   in growth hormone and IGF-1 in the first 30 minutes.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.920]   For men, the biggest increase occurred later
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   in the exercise, which was 60 minutes or so total.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.580]   And so the sex dependent effects are interesting.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.500]   They point to the fact that things like cortisol,
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.580]   testosterone, and estrogen, which of course vary
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.600]   in different levels in men and women,
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.700]   are going to impact the release of things like IGF-1
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.540]   and growth hormone.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:16.260]   And yes, they did control for all sorts of things
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.900]   like diet and they controlled for weight
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.980]   and prior experience.
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.760]   It's actually a quite nice study.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.340]   If you'd like to check it out, it's by Pierce et al,
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:28.500]   Growth Hormone and Insulin Glow Factor-1 Molecular Weight.
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.180]   Isoform response to resistance exercise are sex dependent
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.780]   in frontiers and endocrinology, fine journal in 2020,
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.100]   so it's quite recent.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.420]   So what does this mean?
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.180]   This means if you're exercising
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.800]   and you want growth hormone release, warm up,
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.100]   do the type of exercise we've been discussing.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.980]   Women in the first 30 minutes
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.660]   is when you're going to get the maximum benefit
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.580]   in terms of growth hormone and IGF-1.
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:55.860]   Men, you have to keep going for the entire 60 minutes,
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:58.220]   so don't tap out early if you're interested
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.860]   in getting the growth hormone and IGF-1 release.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.120]   And the same conditions apply about then cooling down
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.220]   and not making the exercise last so long
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.180]   that you don't get the increase in growth hormone
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.820]   the following night.
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.260]   My experience thus far in doing this podcast
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:16.120]   is that people fall into one of two categories.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.900]   There are the, just tell me what to take people,
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:21.980]   the people that are really eager to try supplements
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.180]   and maybe even prescription compounds.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:25.020]   And then there are people
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.460]   who are a little bit more shy about supplementation.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.640]   They are more focused on what they can do with diet
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.900]   and behaviors and things of that sort.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.100]   I don't have a bias either way.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.540]   I try and offer tools that are supported
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:38.240]   by the scientific literature.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.320]   And I always point to safety margins.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.360]   There are supplements that can increase growth hormone
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.320]   to a considerable degree.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.080]   And no, these aren't growth hormone itself,
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.080]   although that of course will increase growth hormone
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.060]   to a considerable degree.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.160]   We will talk about prescription drugs at the end,
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.440]   not just growth hormone,
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.440]   but some other things that are quite prominently
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.520]   in use right now,
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.760]   in particular in the entertainment industry.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:06.260]   It's pretty interesting compounds.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:07.920]   But first let's talk about supplements.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.500]   So this has been known about for some time,
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.280]   but arginine, the amino acid arginine,
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.020]   as well as the amino acid ornithine
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:20.540]   can increase growth hormone levels substantially.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:24.620]   Now, arginine has a number of effects.
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.180]   You can get it from food, you can get it from supplements.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.780]   Some people take it in pill form or capsule form.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.900]   Some people will actually take it by IV, intravenously.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.600]   The levels and the amounts of arginine required
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.560]   to get big growth hormone release increases
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.680]   is pretty substantial.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.880]   So some people will take arginine before bedtime.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.720]   Some people will take it before exercise.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.400]   The prerequisite again is low blood glucose.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.820]   Blood glucose is high, it's going to quash the effect.
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.720]   The amounts of arginine that people take
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.560]   are anywhere from three grams
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.640]   to 10 grams or sometimes even more.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.580]   Although this is definitely a case of more is not better.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:12.800]   There is a threshold at which growth hormone release
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.840]   is actually blunted by taking
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.840]   more than nine grams of arginine.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.680]   Now, nine grams of arginine orally is a lot of pills.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:23.020]   It's at minimum nine pills
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.640]   and it can cause some GI disturbance, right?
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:29.080]   People can feel nauseous, some people will throw it up.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.080]   Some people get some constipation or diarrhea, et cetera,
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.520]   or just stomach aches.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.720]   I'm certainly not suggesting people do this.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.480]   They're not that they take arginine,
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.680]   but that's the reason why most of the studies
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.560]   that looked at the role of arginine
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.560]   on growth hormone levels did it by IV intravenous infusion.
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.600]   So what's interesting, however,
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.980]   is that whether or not it's by mouth or by vein,
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:00.200]   taking arginine can dramatically increase
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.600]   growth hormone release.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.380]   And the levels or the amount of increase
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.640]   raised was anywhere from 100 on the low end,
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:13.300]   but anywhere from basically from 400 to 600%
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.140]   above baseline.
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:17.740]   So these are huge increases in growth hormone.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.340]   Now I've never tried arginine.
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.880]   Arginine is out there for a number of different purposes.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.920]   One of them is to increase growth hormone.
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.920]   And some of the supplements out there
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.320]   to increase growth hormone include arginine and ornithine.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.200]   Arginine does have the effect of dilating arterioles
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.180]   and it basically increases blood supply.
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:42.140]   The arginine pathway is involved in vasodilation.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.600]   It's actually the pathway that's downstream
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.460]   of a lot of drugs that are used
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.020]   to treat things like erectile dysfunction.
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.860]   And anytime people have problems
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.020]   with peripheral blood flow of any kind,
[01:17:55.020 --> 01:18:00.020]   they focus on compounds that will either disrupt the enzymes
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.980]   or will adjust the levels of amino acids
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.340]   to get more vasodilation.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.500]   So taking arginine for the purpose
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.300]   of increasing growth hormone will also have the effect
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.980]   of dilating blood vessels.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.380]   And for people with blood, excuse me, with heart conditions,
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.220]   that actually can be a serious issue.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.300]   Now here is something really important
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.780]   and interesting to note,
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:24.900]   which is that increasing arginine levels
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:28.420]   with the specific goal of increasing growth hormone release
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:33.420]   can actually short circuit the effects of exercise
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.340]   on growth hormone.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.660]   Several studies that I looked at looked at the interaction
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:42.120]   of taking arginine and the exercise
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.780]   or just the arginine or just the exercise alone.
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:47.040]   And so you don't, unfortunately,
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.660]   if growth hormone increases your goal,
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:52.160]   you don't unfortunately get to increase growth hormone 800%
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.860]   by taking arginine and exercising.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.200]   It always seems to be clamped
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.180]   at about 300 to 500% increases, still large increases.
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.900]   So I make that point for several reasons.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:04.600]   First of all, be aware that arginine has these other effects
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.620]   on vasodilation.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.180]   Take those seriously if you have a heart condition
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.620]   or take them seriously in any case.
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.500]   Second of all, you can supplement with arginine,
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.120]   not exercise and get these big increases in growth hormone
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.140]   by taking them before sleep.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:23.300]   But if you're taking the arginine before exercise,
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.380]   you are going to short circuit or clamp the effects
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:29.020]   of exercise on growth hormone, okay?
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:31.720]   So it's something that one could use,
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.420]   but it doesn't have a synergistic effect with exercise.
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.180]   The two more or less cancel each other out, not to zero,
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.100]   but you end up with the same effect you would
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.840]   had you done one or the other.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.280]   So hopefully that's clear.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.640]   The other thing is if one's goal is really
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.460]   to increase arginine in the blood for whatever reason,
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:53.140]   arginine may not actually be the best way to do that
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:56.180]   because of the way it's metabolized in the gut.
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:00.080]   It doesn't have access or get access to the tissues
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.620]   that you're most interested in
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.220]   in terms of increasing growth hormone
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.860]   or vasodilation for that matter.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:08.220]   And in that case, there's something else called L-citrulline
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.860]   which has powerful effects on vasodilation,
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:16.860]   powerful effects potentially on growth hormone levels
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.180]   via the arginine pathway.
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:23.540]   But basically L-citrulline acts as sort of a donor
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:25.880]   or let's say it's kind of a biological prerequisite
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.760]   for arginine and can lead to even bigger arginine increases
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.180]   than you would get if you took arginine itself.
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.660]   And so L-citrulline is out there.
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:37.680]   Keep in mind that anything that dilates the blood vessels
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.100]   will lower blood pressure.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:42.020]   So L-citrulline, yes, will lead to increased blood flow
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.620]   for whatever purpose you want to use it for,
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:47.140]   whether or not that's pumps in the gym or whatever.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:51.060]   It also can lead to big increases in arginine
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:54.200]   and growth hormone, but it will lower blood pressure.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.500]   So be aware of that.
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.660]   But, and understand that the biology
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.700]   isn't so straightforward.
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.400]   L-citrulline may actually be the better way
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.900]   to get arginine increases than arginine itself.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.780]   And ornithine can also increase growth hormone,
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.140]   although that's also through an indirect pathway.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.440]   And nowadays there isn't a lot of focus on ornithine
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.420]   as a way to increase growth hormone.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.700]   That was kind of all the rage in the '90s,
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.740]   not so much anymore.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.560]   Nowadays, the people who are really in the know
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:23.400]   for this stuff tend to focus on L-citrulline.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.560]   And if you're interested in L-citrulline or arginine,
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.320]   I highly recommend you go to our old friend,
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.560]   good friends examine.com,
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.880]   because there you can put it into the list.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:39.000]   You can just put search and it's totally free.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.400]   And it will tell you that blood pressure
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.480]   will be slightly decreased,
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.460]   power output in the gym will increase.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.360]   There's very strong effects on blood glucose.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:51.200]   Fatigue is reduced notably, big increases in nitric oxide.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.040]   That's also related to the increase in vasodilation,
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:59.040]   plasma arginine, very high, excuse me, notable effects,
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.980]   very high support for studies,
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.840]   which allow people more training volume,
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.420]   aerobic exercise, arterial stiffness is brought down.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.660]   There's a huge list of things, increase in growth hormone.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:13.520]   So two studies showing this was done double blind.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.000]   Great, you always want to see double blind,
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.080]   placebo controlled.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.960]   This was only done in males, not in females.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.760]   Unfortunately, just have data from males,
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   but increases in growth hormone.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:27.400]   It's a small, but a real significant effect.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.300]   And again, from quality studies.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.400]   So there's a huge number of effects there.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.680]   And some of the other kind of more interesting ones
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:39.000]   about L-citrulline that you might not have thought about
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.060]   are things like muscle oxygenation,
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:47.280]   as we scroll down, decreases in C-reactive proteins.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.240]   So a lot of the same things that you might expect,
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.020]   excuse me, from the same sorts of compounds we saw before.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.160]   The takeaway here is if you want to increase growth hormone,
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.800]   think about the arginine pathway,
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.160]   but arginine itself might not be
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.540]   the best direct route to get there.
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:03.860]   L-citrulline might be a better option,
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:07.100]   but please do consider and take very seriously
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.600]   the effects on blood pressure.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.880]   So we've been talking about big effects
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:15.380]   from supplementation or exercise on growth hormone,
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.720]   this extremely powerful hormone.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.320]   And one thing to note is that the profile of growth hormone
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.200]   as we age changes.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.500]   I mentioned that earlier,
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.520]   but it's important to understand how it changes.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.200]   One thing that's particularly interesting to me
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.960]   as somebody who's in his 40s
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.620]   is that it's actually between ages 30 and 40
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:39.120]   that the amount of growth hormone that you release
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.960]   each night is reduced by two to threefold.
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.660]   That's really incredible.
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:47.760]   We hear so much about testosterone levels going down
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.960]   as we age or estrogen levels going down.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.360]   But if you recall from the testosterone and estrogen episode
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.980]   talked about the fact that if you really look at the data,
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:58.080]   just for instance, on testosterone,
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:02.160]   there are men in their 90s and they are not rare,
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.480]   it turns out, that are making as much testosterone
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:09.400]   and DHT, dihydrotestosterone, as they were in their 20s.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.160]   Okay, so we hear so much nowadays
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.360]   about how testosterone levels are dropping,
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.520]   sperm levels are dropping, et cetera.
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.420]   And I don't dispute that.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.540]   I talked about that in that episode.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:22.580]   But it's clear that testosterone levels vary tremendously
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:23.960]   from person to person.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.520]   And just getting older does not necessarily mean
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.760]   that testosterone levels are dropping.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.400]   Growth hormone levels, it seems,
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.900]   are dropping when people are in their 30s and 40s
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.340]   and they're dropping substantially.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.580]   And that seems to be the case across the board.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.960]   You're just not going to find people in their 40s, 50s,
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.540]   and 60s that are making as much growth hormone
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:44.780]   as they were in their teens and 20s.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:48.300]   And as somebody who, I feel really good,
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.660]   but as somebody who definitely noticed
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.920]   that as I got into my 40s,
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.160]   that even if I slept the same amount,
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.140]   I wasn't feeling quite as, I would say,
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:02.160]   able to recover from exercise or wound healing,
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.500]   even with the same amount of sleep.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.880]   And I was trying to optimize a great number of things.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.640]   This business of growth hormone
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.400]   became a particular interest to me.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.760]   And since the ways to manipulate growth hormone
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.040]   in men and in women are so straightforward,
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.020]   and since everybody goes through this age-related decline
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.980]   very dramatically, it seems to me that the things
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:22.840]   that we're supposed to be doing anyway, like exercising,
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.620]   like trying not to eat too close to bedtime,
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.700]   trying to optimize sleep,
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.100]   all of these are wonderful tools
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:31.540]   that we should be pursuing and perhaps using,
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:34.220]   and they can actually offset
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:36.320]   the two to three-fold decrease, right?
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.120]   If we're talking about a two to three-fold decrease
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.240]   for people that are in their 30s and 40s,
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.280]   and then we're talking about increases from exercise
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.160]   or from maybe from supplementation,
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.000]   but certainly from exercise of 300 to 500%,
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.960]   well, then all of a sudden we're in a position
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.160]   to actually offset the age-related decline
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.800]   in growth hormone completely just through behaviors.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.120]   And I think that's quite interesting and quite powerful.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.680]   Now I'd like to discuss a way that anyone can increase
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.160]   their levels of growth hormone dramatically.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.520]   And when I say dramatically, I mean dramatically.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.400]   I'll get to the numbers in a couple of minutes,
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.400]   but we have to remember how growth hormone
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.480]   is released in the first place.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.000]   Remember, it all starts in the brain, in the hypothalamus.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.440]   The hypothalamus is a brain area
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.320]   that controls things like sexual behavior,
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.580]   temperature regulation, circadian behavior,
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:26.800]   meaning when you want to be awake
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.460]   and when you want to be asleep, aggression, all of that.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.120]   There are other brain areas involved too,
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.180]   but it has a rich collection of different neurons
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.860]   involved in all these very basic functions.
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:42.580]   Now, as we talked about the releasing hormones,
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:44.920]   the growth hormone releasing hormone
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.300]   comes from neurons in the hypothalamus.
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:49.820]   Those then communicate with the pituitary
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:52.940]   and the pituitary releases growth hormone.
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.180]   And then the growth hormone acts
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:55.300]   on all these different tissues,
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:58.400]   muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.220]   Makes them use energy.
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.260]   That's why you lose body fat
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.860]   when growth hormone levels are high.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:07.460]   Makes you grow muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera.
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:13.640]   Now, one of the things that has a profound effect
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.800]   on growth hormone levels,
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.780]   growth hormone release is temperature.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:21.020]   Now, the data on this are very strong
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:23.220]   and the data come from both animal studies
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.100]   and human studies.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.020]   So there are a number of studies that have explored
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:31.580]   how making animals cold or hot can increase growth hormone.
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.220]   And if you're guessing which direction this is going to go,
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:38.140]   you can probably imagine that making animals
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:41.100]   or people warmer is the way to go
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.220]   if you want to increase growth hormone.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.940]   Now, anytime you're going to increase temperature
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:49.660]   of yourself or anyone else or an animal, it is risky.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:51.180]   I want to be really clear about this.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.140]   Not everyone should engage in the behaviors
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:57.220]   I'm about to describe, but,
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.100]   and I should just say the reason it's risky
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:01.020]   is it doesn't take much of a temperature increase
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:03.780]   in the brain to cook the brain, to cook neurons.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.620]   And after that point, neurons can't come back
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:09.540]   and people can die from hyperthermia.
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:11.420]   We have a much greater range in terms of cold.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:14.940]   You can also die of hypothermia, you can freeze to death,
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:18.180]   but you have a much greater range of getting cold
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.400]   than you do warming up the brain.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.780]   However, there are really strong data pointing to the fact
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:29.780]   that sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia,
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:34.020]   not too high, however, that sauna can increase
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.900]   the release of growth hormone and other hormones.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.060]   And what's so dramatic about this literature
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:42.660]   is the size of the effects that are reported.
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:45.140]   So first of all, let's talk about
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.360]   these temperature increases.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.460]   And yes, I will refer to things that people can do
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.340]   even if you don't own a sauna,
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.540]   because I realize not everybody has sauna in their backyard
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:57.020]   or has access to a sauna.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:01.500]   So first of all, recall our study about exercise
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.940]   where warming up a few degrees before the exercise
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.580]   led to bigger and quicker increases in growth hormone
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:11.100]   during the exercise bout itself.
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.640]   So that already pointed in the direction
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.440]   that temperature was important.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.700]   Now, the degrees, no pun intended,
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:21.620]   that we're talking about increasing body temperature
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:25.140]   is by entering saunas that are somewhere
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:28.140]   between 176 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.220]   so that's 80 degrees Celsius,
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:36.540]   and all the way up to like 210, 215 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.480]   I personally know people that go even higher than that,
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.260]   but they've trained themselves to deal with very high heat.
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:43.740]   So again, high heat is dangerous.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.600]   You must clear this with your doctor.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.460]   Now, what happens in high heat?
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:48.740]   Couple of things happen in high heat.
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:51.940]   First of all, you start getting bigger stroke volume
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.500]   of the heart, kind of like an exercise.
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.700]   Once you get well-trained in endurance activity,
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:57.180]   your stroke volume, the amount of blood
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.640]   that your heart can pump each time gets larger.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.860]   You dilate the blood vessels, right?
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:04.000]   There are a lot of things that happen also.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.660]   You're sweating, your body's trying to unload heat.
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:11.420]   Dilation of blood vessels, arginine increases in heat.
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:14.620]   We're starting to see and hear a common theme,
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:17.160]   but it appears that getting into,
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.900]   I'm not saying getting the body up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.140]   I want to be very clear,
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:23.460]   not talking about getting the body up to 100 degrees,
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.460]   Celsius, that would be terrible.
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:26.420]   You would die.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.160]   But entering environments where it's very hot
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.380]   for short periods of time,
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.180]   anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes,
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:38.980]   where the temperature is 80 degrees Celsius
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:42.540]   to 100 degrees Celsius, or 175 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:45.220]   more or less, to about 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.380]   more or less, has been shown
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:51.740]   to increase growth hormone release 16 fold.
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:53.160]   That's right, 16 fold.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.780]   That's 1,600%.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:58.040]   Now, there are also effects on other hormones,
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.520]   prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:04.000]   So the pattern that was described in this study,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.700]   and there've been many studies now,
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:08.840]   endocrine effects of rupita sauna
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:13.280]   were done in 17 humans.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:16.500]   This was from doing this repeatedly.
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:17.860]   So it wasn't the first time they did this.
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.900]   They actually had to do this three days in a row.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:23.380]   And the pattern was to get into the sauna for 20 minutes,
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:25.420]   followed by a 30 minute cooling period.
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:27.200]   Remember, you don't want to spend long periods of time
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.040]   at high heat.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.800]   You can cook your brain and other tissues.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.320]   Be very careful as you approach this if you decide to.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.540]   But 30 minutes, excuse me, 20 minutes sauna,
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:38.120]   followed by 30 minutes of cooling,
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.620]   followed by 20 minutes sauna, again,
[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.680]   led to a five-fold increase in growth hormone.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:47.160]   And then by doing that day after day after day,
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.120]   on the third day, you would see these huge increases
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.640]   of like 16-fold, up to 16-fold.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.440]   And there are now many studies like this.
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.460]   This was described a few years ago.
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:02.560]   But since then, there have been a number of other studies
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.020]   that have pointed in the direction
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:07.880]   of deliberate hyperthermia,
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.960]   but not too hot that you kill yourself
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.920]   in order to increase growth hormone.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.740]   And I know I keep highlighting the dangers there,
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:16.680]   but again, anytime you're going to mess with heat,
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.040]   you have to be cautious.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.000]   You have to be careful.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.920]   So standard sauna can be useful.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.520]   If you don't have access to a sauna,
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.280]   one way that people do this,
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.640]   we have to look to our friends, the wrestlers, right?
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:31.240]   They wear plastics, which are basically body suits
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.680]   that are fairly inexpensive that you can buy
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   on any online purchase platform, I should say.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.400]   Some people in the old days
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:46.400]   before they had these plastics things so readily available,
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.660]   I actually knew people that wrapped themselves
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:50.640]   in garbage bags and then throw on sweats and a hoodie
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.160]   and then go out for a jog.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.520]   Again, you have to be really careful,
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.680]   especially on a hot day, overheating can equate to death,
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.940]   but that's another way to heat up.
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:00.600]   You don't actually need a sauna.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.720]   I've known people who will do this in hotel rooms
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:03.960]   while they're traveling.
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.600]   They'll turn on the heat, make a hot bath.
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.400]   They won't actually get in the bath,
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.320]   but they'll fill the room with steam and heat
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:14.000]   and they'll put on a hoodie and some sweat pants
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.900]   and they'll sit there with wool socks on
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.580]   and they'll get warm for 20 minutes.
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:20.780]   Then they'll take a cool shower and then they'll do it again.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.700]   I guess when the hotel's paying the water bill,
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:24.080]   you don't worry about it too much.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.520]   Some people of course own saunas.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.360]   There are a lot of ways to do that.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.740]   I have friends who were in the military
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:30.640]   who made saunas out of cars while they were overseas,
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.680]   all sorts of things.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:32.900]   You do have to be careful.
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.200]   I know I've said it many, many times.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.720]   I just don't want anyone to hurt themselves,
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:38.060]   but these increases in growth hormone are tremendous.
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:40.240]   And what they probably stem from
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.880]   are increased activity of neurons within the hypothalamus
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.820]   that stimulate growth hormone release from the pituitary.
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.960]   And that's probably because
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.640]   the growth hormone releasing hormone neurons
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.440]   in the hypothalamus sit very closely
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.180]   and may even be intermixed with some of the neurons
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:00.760]   in the hypothalamus that regulate heat and body temperature.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.480]   Remember metabolism is in part a heat.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.120]   It's like a furnace of how much energy you're consuming
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:11.080]   and using for building or for energy usage purposes.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.620]   So sauna can be very, very interesting
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:16.120]   and again, it's 20 minutes, 30 minute cooling,
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:20.260]   20 minutes again, proceed with extreme caution,
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:23.200]   but nonetheless, these are pretty extreme effects
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.060]   in terms of their abilities
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.360]   to increase growth hormone levels.
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.460]   Along the lines of temperature and hormones,
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.720]   I just want to mention a very recent study just came out,
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.360]   March, April, 2021,
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:38.000]   endocrine effects of repeated hot thermal stress
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.480]   and cold water immersion in young adult men.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.500]   Unfortunately, it was just in men.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.640]   They didn't look at women,
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.620]   but nonetheless, I think the data are relevant
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.600]   to everybody as a general theme.
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.840]   This is Podstrowski et al.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.500]   I will put a link to the study in the caption.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:56.040]   And they looked at testosterone, prolactin, cortisol,
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.420]   et cetera, and what they found was that
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:03.240]   the sauna does indeed lead to a significant decrease
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.040]   in cortisol, a stress hormone,
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.620]   a hormone that you want to be released early in the day
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:08.740]   when you wake up,
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:12.520]   but sauna definitely led to a significant decrease
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.360]   in cortisol, but did not change testosterone,
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.520]   DHEA, or prolactin levels.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.080]   So that's interesting.
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.360]   And it turns out that the cold
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.640]   did affect some of these hormones,
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:27.600]   but the results there were a little bit more mixed.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.960]   So the takeaway here is that heat
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:32.560]   seems to have positive effects on growth hormone,
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.400]   big effects.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.040]   It seems to have positive effects
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.620]   on reducing cortisol levels,
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.640]   and it does not seem to have effects
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:42.800]   on things like testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin directly.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.640]   You can imagine that a shift in any hormone
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.200]   is going to alter the levels of other hormones
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.400]   down the line, sort of indirect effects,
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.320]   but in terms of direct effects,
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:54.840]   just during or immediately after the sauna bath,
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.000]   there were no effects.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.540]   So we've talked about diet, supplementation,
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.560]   behavioral tools,
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.160]   and of course we talked about
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.800]   the underlying biology and logic.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.080]   And hopefully you heard the safety precautions
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.820]   for all of those.
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:14.880]   Now I'd like to just briefly talk about
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.360]   the prescription side of all this.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.560]   There are, as we know, many people taking growth hormone
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.420]   because it's been prescribed to them by a doctor.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:25.580]   And presumably there are people taking growth hormone,
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.860]   even though it has not been prescribed by a doctor,
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.040]   which is none of my business.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.040]   But the point here is that
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.560]   most all of the hormones that we make
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.260]   have been synthesized.
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.080]   So there are versions of them in little bottles
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.780]   or little ampules that people can inject.
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:44.760]   Here are a couple of important things to consider
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.840]   if you're going to go that route.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.280]   First of all, talk to a physician, right?
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   They actually are only legally available through a physician.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.700]   Second of all, anytime you're injecting something,
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:57.540]   you're going to shut down your own production.
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:59.400]   That's the way that the hormone system works.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.640]   If you take thyroid hormone,
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.800]   you won't make thyroid hormone,
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.060]   at least in the long run.
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:06.460]   If you take testosterone,
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:09.540]   you will shut down your own production of testosterone.
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:12.900]   If you take estrogen, the system's a little more resilient,
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.140]   but eventually you will shut down
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.680]   your production of estrogen.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.020]   And the same is true for growth hormone.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:22.420]   So a decision to go that route of taking something
[01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.140]   is often not always a decision to do it forever.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:27.660]   However, if you're willing to sustain a period
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:29.980]   of being without a given hormone,
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:33.460]   some people can do things and then stop taking them.
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:37.360]   And then wait out the period in which they're not making
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.020]   testosterone, estrogen, or growth hormone,
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.180]   and then it will come back.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:41.920]   Sometimes, and sometimes it won't.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.060]   There's a kind of new area that's developing now
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.160]   that I think deserves our attention,
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:51.340]   not because I'm encouraging it, but because it is happening.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:54.260]   And in keeping with the science
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:57.980]   and in keeping with trying to keep things modern,
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:00.420]   it's worth us discussing, and those are peptides.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:02.980]   So these days you hear a lot about peptides.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:06.000]   I'd like to clarify a little bit about what peptides are.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.820]   Peptides is a really huge category of biological compounds.
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:13.940]   Peptides are just strings of amino acids, right?
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:16.380]   So we've talked about L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine,
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.740]   those are amino acids, those are individual amino acids.
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:22.960]   And those are put together into little small peptides,
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.220]   or they're what are called polypeptides,
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:27.020]   which are just longer peptides.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:31.320]   Turns out that for any substance like growth hormone
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.920]   or growth hormone-releasing hormone,
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.500]   it's made up of different amino acids
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.540]   in different sequences,
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:38.660]   just like your genes are made up of A's and G's
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.040]   and C's and T's, nucleotides in different sequences.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.300]   It's like a recipe.
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:48.080]   Peptides tend to be short sequences of amino acids
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.760]   that resemble a hormone enough
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.440]   or resemble some other peptide enough
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.960]   that it can lead to the similar or same effects
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.100]   when you inject them.
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:01.300]   So for example, we make growth hormone-releasing hormone
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.220]   from our brain, which stimulates growth hormone
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:04.060]   from the pituitary.
[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:07.060]   You're probably getting tired of me saying that by now.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:11.620]   But people now will take things like sermorelin,
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:16.620]   S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin,
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:19.540]   which is not the entire peptide sequence
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.460]   of growth hormone-releasing hormone,
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:23.060]   but it's a subset of those.
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:25.480]   And when people inject it before they go to sleep at night,
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.600]   it's typically how it's done on an empty stomach,
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.160]   then that stimulates the release of growth hormone
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.280]   from the pituitary.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.540]   So this is not taking growth hormone.
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:36.040]   This is taking the stimulating hormone
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.160]   or what's often called a secretagogue or a mimic, all right?
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:44.020]   It causes a secretion of the hormone that one wants.
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:45.720]   People will do this for thyroid hormone too.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.080]   Some people are doing this by prescription
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.240]   with a real medical need.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:52.120]   Other people are doing it for just longevity reasons,
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.060]   which kind of falls into that gray zone
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:55.760]   of they wouldn't die without it,
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.460]   but they want to enhance their life.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:58.600]   And so they're doing that
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.360]   because they believe it's the right thing for them.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.060]   Prescription, sermorelin is prescription.
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:03.960]   Do they work?
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.480]   Yes.
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.000]   Do they shut down your natural production
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.720]   of growth hormone-releasing hormone?
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.300]   Well, the answer is yes,
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:16.360]   but some of these peptides actually have the effect
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.360]   of changing gene expression.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:19.640]   Remember way back to the beginning
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.000]   when I was talking about hormones,
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.720]   they can actually change gene expression
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:25.600]   and they can actually set pathways in motion
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.520]   for continued production of a hormone
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.880]   even if you stop taking the compound.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.720]   Now that can be good or that can be bad
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:34.780]   because as you recall, growth hormone in big,
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:37.000]   big increases in growth hormone that are short-lived
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.860]   like sauna or I should say exercise or arginine or sauna,
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:43.720]   it seems like has these huge effects,
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:49.120]   or early nights, first phase of sleep early in the night,
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:50.880]   these sorts of things.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.700]   Those are transient,
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:56.280]   but when one is injecting over and over a constant level,
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   you can put into action gene expression programs
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.400]   that can be long-lived.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.400]   And let's say you have a particular tumor in the body,
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.540]   tumors will grow when they see growth hormone
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:08.320]   even if that tumor is unhealthy for you, right?
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.080]   You've got growth of tissues all over the body.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:11.400]   So again, I'm not saying whether or not
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.080]   people should do these things or not doing them.
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:16.680]   One thing I do know is that they are in very prominent use
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.780]   in the movie industry,
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.660]   people who want to peel off body fat quickly,
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:21.760]   they do increase recovery time,
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:22.920]   they increase healing rates,
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:26.160]   people are also injecting things like gastric peptides,
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.200]   they're actually stomach peptides
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.040]   that we talked about in the previous episode,
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.700]   things related to the ghrelin pathway,
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.420]   and other things from the liver
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:37.580]   that can improve the rate of tissue and wound healing.
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:39.920]   You can bet that in the upcoming Olympics,
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.440]   a lot of people are using peptides and compounds,
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.800]   and I'm not pointing fingers at anyone in particular,
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.280]   it's just this is separate from hormone augmentation
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.000]   of like injecting GH or injecting testosterone,
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.660]   people are now working further up the pathways.
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:54.060]   Other names of some of the peptides
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:58.940]   are things like ipramoralin, tesamoralin,
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.820]   some of these have clinical uses,
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:03.580]   others have just been made as compounds
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.780]   for people in the kind of longevity field
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:09.620]   or the self-augmentation field, if you will.
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:11.260]   So again, not promoting their use,
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:12.220]   but they're definitely out there,
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:14.140]   and so now if you hear about them
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:15.600]   or someone's talking to you about them,
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.180]   now hopefully you have a better understanding
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.580]   about their underlying biology
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:20.740]   and you can think rationally about whether or not
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:23.780]   they are the right decision for you.
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:28.060]   Okay, once again, covered an enormous amount of material,
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:30.340]   hopefully now you understand thyroid hormone
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:32.740]   and what it does and a little bit about its mechanism
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:35.300]   or maybe a lot and growth hormone and what it does
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:38.940]   and how both of them take care of our metabolism,
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:42.460]   they dictate how many nutrients we can eat and make use of,
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:45.500]   they can pull from body fat stores, repair muscle,
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:48.500]   repair cartilage, they really are incredible compounds
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:50.980]   and they're actionable, they're things that we can do
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:53.460]   like getting that early phase of sleep,
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:56.620]   perhaps supplementing with arginine, maybe not,
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:43:00.140]   hopefully getting adequate exercise, warming up properly,
[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:03.060]   not making the exercise too long or too intense will help,
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:05.580]   maybe sauna or things like it,
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:09.540]   deliberate safe hyperthermia with the emphasis on safe
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.620]   might be things that are of use.
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:13.940]   Regardless, even if you're not interested in the thyroid
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:16.020]   or the growth hormone pathways,
[01:43:16.020 --> 01:43:18.240]   this brings to a close our month on hormones
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.120]   and so now hopefully you understand
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.620]   not just thyroid and growth hormone,
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:24.340]   but the logic that underlies thyroid hormone,
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:26.960]   growth hormone, estrogen, testosterone,
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.160]   why we eat, why we stop eating, cholecystokinin, ghrelin.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:33.020]   If these names don't mean anything to you,
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:35.100]   then perhaps go back and listen to those episodes,
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.760]   but regardless, I hope that you come away from this
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:40.500]   with a deeper understanding about these hormones
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.800]   which are so powerful in controlling
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.220]   the way our brain functions
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:46.640]   and the interplay between the brain and hormones
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.060]   because it is really a bi-directional conversation,
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.180]   the brain is telling the body what hormones to make,
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:54.420]   the hormones are influencing all the tissues of the body,
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:56.780]   but also telling the brain whether or not to eat more
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.920]   or grow more or think more, et cetera.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:02.780]   So I really appreciate your time and attention.

[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:53.300]   at the beginning of the podcast episode.
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:54.700]   That really helps us.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:56.460]   We also have a Patreon account.
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:59.820]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:01.300]   There you can support the podcast
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.580]   at any level that you like.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.300]   And I mentioned supplements this episode.
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.820]   I often mention supplements.
[01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:09.420]   They are certainly not necessary,
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.300]   but for those of you interested in supplements,
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:14.620]   we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:17.180]   because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.140]   in terms of the quality of the ingredients
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:21.100]   and the amount of the ingredients
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:24.620]   in each capsule, tablet, powder, et cetera.
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:26.920]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.860]   as well as get a discount on any of those
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:31.180]   or any of the supplements that Thorne makes,
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:36.180]   it's thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, .com/u/huberman,
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:40.240]   and you can get 20% off any of the supplements they make.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:43.140]   I should mention Thorne works with the Mayo Clinic.
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.080]   They partnered with them.
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.900]   They work with all the major sports teams.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.980]   So really the highest levels of stringency,
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:50.220]   we're quite happy to be working with them.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:52.100]   And last but not least,
[01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:53.820]   I thank you for your time and attention
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:56.120]   and above all, for your interest in science.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:58.700]   [upbeat music]
[01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:01.280]   (upbeat music)
