[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280]   Purgatory is the topic today.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:14.440]   We briefly touched on purgatory in three past APJs in Episode 1150, 1162, and 1290, but
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   nothing at length.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.680]   And that changes today with a question from Sydney, who lives in the beautiful state of
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.400]   Arizona, along with me.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.640]   Hi, Pastor John.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.240]   I know that some older Christians believed in a secondary refinement or purgatory, purging
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200]   of the soul after death and before heaven.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.200]   C.S.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.440]   Lewis once rhetorically wrote, "Our souls demand purgatory, don't they?"
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.080]   He explained that Christians should want purgatory as a sort of self-cleaning up before we're
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.200]   ready to enter into the eternal presence of God.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.280]   He said this in his book, Letters to Malcolm, Chiefly on Prayer, page 108.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.000]   Coming from Lewis, purgatory seems like a humble, preparatory step before we enter eternity.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.640]   Biblically speaking, 1 Corinthians 3, 10-15 is the most common biblical proof for it.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.120]   There we read that "each one's work will become manifest, for the day will disclose it, because
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.240]   it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done."
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.440]   That's verse 13.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.240]   "And if anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, although he himself will be saved,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.000]   but only as through fire."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.560]   That's verse 15.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.360]   But does the Bible confirm purgatory?
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.080]   This is really interesting that this question would come just now, because I am listening
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.880]   to Lewis's book, Letters to Malcolm, Chiefly on Prayer, at this very moment.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.920]   It's on my phone.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.240]   So I'm sort of primed.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:50.280]   As much as I love C.S. Lewis and stand in awe of his gifts of logic and poetic vision
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:02.480]   and his capacities to express things in vivid, concrete, inimitable, analogical ways, nevertheless,
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.680]   his position and his reasoning on purgatory miss the mark.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.960]   He says flat out in Letters to Malcolm, Chiefly on Prayer, page 108, quote—I'll give you
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.000]   a longer quote than was given to us.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.800]   "I believe in purgatory.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.480]   Our souls demand purgatory, don't they?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.360]   Would it not break the heart if God said to us, 'It's true, my son, that your breath
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:42.320]   smells and your rags drip with mud and slime, but we are charitable here'"—meaning
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.880]   heaven—"and no one will upbraid you with these things nor draw away from you.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.000]   Enter into the joy.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.840]   Should we not reply, 'With submission, sir, if there's no objection, I'd rather be
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.160]   cleansed first.'
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.400]   It may hurt, you know.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   Even so, sir."
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   End quote.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   It's good writing.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   I love it.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   I love it.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   It's dead wrong, man.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   I love it.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   No, it's not quite dead wrong.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   I'll try to explain.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:25.280]   Now, what's typical of Lewis here, as most places, is that he rarely quotes Scripture.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.020]   If you've read Lewis—I've read almost all of Lewis—you don't go to C.S. Lewis
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.080]   to watch serious biblical exposition in the making.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.080]   You don't.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.960]   No doubt he knows his Bible.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.120]   Goodness gracious.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.640]   He can quote his Greek New Testament probably better than I can.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.280]   He's probably got parts of it memorized, and his theology is generally true.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:54.080]   He's not a heretic, but if he had tried to support this belief with Scripture, he
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.240]   would have been hard put to do it.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:06.320]   Now before I go into particular texts that make purgatory, I think, untenable biblically,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.720]   let's define it the way the Roman Catholic Church does, because they're the ones who
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:20.320]   promote this doctrine, and let's see whether Lewis's argument stands on its own terms.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.880]   So here's what the Catholic Church, the catechism of the Catholic Church, says in defining purgatory.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.360]   Quote, "All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified,
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.640]   are indeed assured of their eternal salvation, but after death they undergo purification
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.320]   so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.840]   The church gives the name purgatory to this final purification of the elect, which is
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.240]   entirely different from the punishment of the damned."
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.040]   So that's all from the catechism of the Catholic Church.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:12.920]   There is no doubt that we must be purified completely without sin in order to enter the
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.600]   very presence of God in our final state.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.280]   Otherwise we'd be incinerated, and God would be defiled and dishonored.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.360]   None of us believe that is going to happen, so we're all in agreement about that.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.480]   That's not going to happen.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.440]   Nobody's going into the very presence of God with any stain or inner sin left.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.680]   But here's the assumption that Lewis and the Catholic Church bring to the situation.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:51.240]   Their assumption is that it requires another process beyond the process of this life to
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.400]   get abiding sin out of our lives.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.040]   Now why would they assume that?
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.160]   Because we had a relatively long process of purification or sanctification in this life
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.280]   by the Holy Spirit, and it did not perfect us.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:20.520]   We realize it's going to take a divine stroke or word of purification by the hand of God
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:28.440]   or the Word of God the way Jesus purified people instantaneously with a word in order
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.680]   to finish this purifying work.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:41.160]   Why would we not rather assume that God does it first progressively in this life and then
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.280]   at the end finishes it instantaneously?
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.000]   But enough with our human reasoning.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.360]   Let's go to the Bible.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:58.680]   The Roman Catholic Church includes some books in their Bible, the Apocrypha—it's called
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.600]   the Apocrypha—which Protestants don't have in our Bible.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.840]   One of those books is 2 Maccabees, and in chapter 12, verses 42 to 45, there is this
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:18.920]   sentence, "Therefore Judas Maccabeus made atonement for the dead, that they might be
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.760]   delivered from their sin."
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.320]   Now from that statement, the Catholic Church infers that not only should you pray for the
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:39.640]   dead, but the dead have sins from which they must be delivered, which leads them to postulate
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.920]   purgatory.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.760]   Now Sidney in his question points out that if you're going to go after any New Testament
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:55.880]   text at all to support purgatory, the one you would go to most is 1 Corinthians 3, 13
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:02.480]   to 14, and I'll quote it again to show how inapplicable it is to purgatory.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:11.080]   "Each one's work," so each Christian's work, "will become manifest, for the day
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.240]   will disclose it."
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.920]   So this is the judgment day in which we are going to be shown to be true or false, and
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.240]   our works are going to be shown to be stubble or valuable.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.040]   "Because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.920]   one has done.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:40.720]   If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.280]   If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.120]   but only as through fire."
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:58.720]   Now in that text, there's no hint of passing through an extended period of time with the
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.640]   aim of cleansing us from our own impurities.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:11.400]   This is a picture of a single one-time event where our works from this life are shown to
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.880]   be either stubble, for which there's no reward, or precious stones, for which there
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.280]   will be a reward.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.920]   There's no foundation here for purgatory in a text like this.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:32.200]   On the contrary, several texts point in the opposite direction about what happens when
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.280]   we die as Christians.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:42.000]   Here's what Paul says in Philippians 1:23, "My desire is to depart"—that's die—"and
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   be with Christ, for that is far better."
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.880]   So the picture is death and an immediate, joyful fellowship with Jesus.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.120]   Same thing confirmed in 2 Corinthians 5, 6-9, only it's even clearer.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.840]   He says, "We are always of good courage.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:11.620]   We know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:19.680]   We would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.960]   So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him."
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:33.760]   I don't know how it could be much clearer than to say, "Away from the body is at home
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.600]   with the Lord."
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.520]   That's our immediate hope, not any intervening purgatory between being away from the body
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.920]   and being at home with the Lord.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:53.560]   But to be away from the body is to be at home with the Lord, which Paul says is far better.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:02.120]   So let me go back and suggest why what C.S. Lewis imagined between the dirty saint and
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:08.440]   God happening at the pearly gates—this discussion they had—would, in fact, never happen.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:17.840]   Now, you recall, Lewis pictures God saying, "It's true, my son, that your breath smells,
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:25.600]   your rags drip with mud and slime, but we are charitable here, and no one will upbraid
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:32.720]   you with these things, nor draw away from you, so enter into the joy."
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:44.440]   Now, if that were to happen, the saint surely would indeed say, "Yes, Lord, nothing impure
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   shall enter your presence."
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:56.640]   Would you now then, in great mercy, complete the purchase of your son, namely my cleansing,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:04.600]   and simply say the word, be clean, the way your son did?
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:12.560]   When the apostle Paul pictured the resurrection of all the imperfect saints in 1 Corinthians
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.400]   15, he said, "Behold, I tell you a mystery.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:24.520]   We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.480]   eye at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, and the dead in Christ will be raised
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.280]   imperishable, and we shall be changed."
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:44.280]   Now that instantaneous change of our bodies at the resurrection is a better, more biblical
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:50.480]   picture of what happens to the imperfect soul at death.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.920]   In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, God says to us, just like Jesus said to the leper
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:06.240]   in Luke 5:13, "Be clean," and immediately his leprosy left him.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:13.120]   That will happen physically at the resurrection, and for those who die before the resurrection,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.200]   it happens spiritually at death.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.480]   Glorious.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.240]   There is a metamorphosis to be had before we can enjoy eternity forever, and it happens
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.080]   in the blink of a camera flash.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.520]   We will see Christ and become like Him in the same moment.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   Beautiful.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.520]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.760]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.840]   You can ask a question of your own, search our growing archive, or subscribe to the podcast.

[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.680]   Well you don't have to be a Christian to see the destructive power of pornography on the
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.120]   human brain.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.640]   You don't have to be a Christian to discern the difference between love and lust.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.080]   You certainly don't have to be a Christian to know that adultery destroys marriages.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.040]   But you must be a Christian to see the battle for sexual purity within its fullest reality.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.080]   So how do we battle lust like Christians?
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.840]   And how does sexuality find its ultimate purpose and right place in our lives?
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.360]   Next time we will take a look at the key to it all.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360]   The key to it all.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   That's no overstatement.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.080]   The key to it all.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.080]   Don't miss it.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.200]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:18.840]   Thanks for listening.
