[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   I'm going to say this a lot because I think it's extremely important for people to trust
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040]   their Bible.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.280]   To know that their Bible has the answer is really my priority and The Legacy makes it
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.740]   very easy to do that because you're training people to trust the Word of God.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.400]   When they have different translations, I even encourage them, "I think you need to get
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.640]   a Legacy."
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.480]   People will come up and say, "Why Legacy for you?
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.620]   Why is that better than the New American Standard or the New King James or whatever they might
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.460]   be using?"
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.340]   For me, it goes back to when you have a pastor who from the pulpit is preaching and he's
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.560]   preaching from a translation that you can follow.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.920]   It helps to take that same translation back into your study and that's what I use, The
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.280]   Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.960]   They can go back into the study, they can see the exact points I'm making and again,
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.440]   it creates trust.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.080]   It doesn't create confusion.
