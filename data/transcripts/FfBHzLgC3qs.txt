[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Let's start as always with questions about deep work.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Our first question comes from Brandon.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Brandon asks, "Does adopting a slow productivity mindset
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   mean you should ditch your to-do list and capture systems?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Am I doing too much if I need a full-fledged capture system?"
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Well, Brandon, in an ideal world, where you had complete control
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   over what your working life looked like and you had no concerns about money,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   you were independently wealthy, so you could completely control your working life,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I would say, yeah, it would be great if you didn't need all the things I talk about
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   when I talk about time management.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   You don't need complicated capture systems.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   You don't need weekly and daily time block plans.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   That would probably actually be ideal.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And there are some people who do actually more or less accomplish this.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The example that I like to give comes from probably the first article I wrote
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   that began to scratch the surface on some of these ideas.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   It's also one of the favorite articles I've written in the past two years.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And it was for The New Yorker, and it was called
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   "The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done."
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And the narrative spine of this article was Merlin Mann.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   So this name is familiar to a lot of Deep Questions listeners,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   but Merlin Mann, in the 2000s, started this blog called 43 Folders
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   that was all about using modern technology to build these hyper-optimized,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   digitally enhanced productivity systems.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   He had a job as a project manager that he took in the '90s,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   that as we fell into more and more of a culture of constant communication
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and constant email and constant work overload,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   the culture I talk about in my book, "A World Without Email,"
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   he got more and more overloaded, and he stumbled across David Allen
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   and getting things done, and he was a real tech guy.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So he was like, "Man, I think if we could just build the right tools,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I could stop feeling this way, where I'm completely overwhelmed
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and completely stressed out."
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And so he started writing about trying to build those tools,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   and a lot of other people felt the same way.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So that website got very popular, and he became a real leader
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   of the productivity movement.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Eventually, he was doing that website full-time and giving talks about it,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   and then he got a book deal to write a book about it,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and that's when the wheels came off.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And this is the narrative that was the spine for that article,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   is that Merlin Mann eventually figured out,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   "I can't fix this problem by organizing better
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   the deluge of things that are coming towards me,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   by having better tools, having better systems,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   better processes for dealing with the deluges coming with me."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   He said, "Ultimately, I can fix this problem by reducing the deluge.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   That instead of having a better system for having too much to do,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   what if I changed my notion of work so I didn't have that much to do,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   so that having these productivity systems that are so complex
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   would be unnecessary?" And that's roughly what he did.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   He shifted into podcasting pretty early on.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   He's like, "This is just what I'm going to do."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And the way he explained it to me when I talked to him about it
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   for the article was he doesn't really need those systems
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   because his life is really simple. He has a recording schedule.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   "This is when I need to be in the studio to record my podcast."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And that's kind of it.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Now, he keeps to-do lists for household stuff.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   "What do I need to buy at the grocery store?" or whatever.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He basically simplified his working life down to the point where
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   he didn't really need to manage it. So I think, yes, kind of ideally,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   a slow productivity ideal would be such that you're working
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   on a small number of things one at a time. It's clear what you're working on.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   There's not that much to track. You don't have to squeeze
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   as much as possible out of an 8-hour day because you're juggling
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   16 different tasks and projects, and you have to make progress on each
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   without losing your mind. You don't need 6 Trello boards each
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   for different roles because you only have one role.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That's the thing you need to do right now. You're writing, or you're recording.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So, yes, I think, Brandon, you're on to something. Ideally,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   you would not need all of these systems. Now, in the real world,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   it's hard to get all the way to that point.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   If you can't get all the way to that point, then having all these systems
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   is what you absolutely need.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   This weird step function here.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So if you've simplified things, but there's still a non-trivial amount
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   of work on your plate, by taming that with systems,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   you can actually get closer to the slow ideal.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So having more systems is actually
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   important when you're close to the slow
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   productivity ideal, but not quite there.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I've been working through some of these thoughts recently about slow productivity.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I mean, I think, for example,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   part of what you can do with systems if you're trying to be
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   embrace more slow productivity is you can be much more automated
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   about your small tasks.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   With the right systems, you can push these small
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   tasks into certain times on certain days so that they're not weighing
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   on your mind elsewise. So you can't get rid of them, but you can
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   tame them, you can automate them and control them and move them
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   into certain places where they only take your time three hours
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   a week at these set times. That requires a lot of systems, but
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   that's compressing the impact on your schedule.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It's compressing the impact so your mind can be free
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   in other times. I think being very careful about tracking
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   what you're working on is critical if you're going to reduce that because
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   you can figure out what is my limits, what is the limit
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   of work that I can handle easily.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   You can't figure that out if you're not carefully tracking this and tracking
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   your time. So systems are critical for slow
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   productivity. If and when
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Intel you reach the slow productivity ideal, then maybe you don't
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   need them anymore. Most of us aren't going to get there. So Brandon, most of us need
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   systems. We want to be careful about our time so that we can protect
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   that time. And then if we're lucky,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   we'll end up in a Merlin man type situation
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   where we don't need the systems anymore. But until we get there, I think
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   systems help make you do the best
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   with what you can.
