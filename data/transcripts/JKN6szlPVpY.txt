[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.000]   Welcome to Bogle Heads on Investing, episode number 55.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.480]   Today, our special guest is Edward Chancellor.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.120]   He is a leading financial historian, journalist,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.360]   investment strategist, and the author
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.800]   of two bestselling books, Devil Take the Hindmost
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.960]   and The Price of Time.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:38.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.760]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.440]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.480]   of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.040]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.560]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.160]   for Financial Literacy, a nonprofit organization that
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.120]   is building a world of well-informed, capable,
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.600]   and empowered investors.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.880]   My special guest today is Edward Chancellor.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.240]   One of the benefits of being a podcast host
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.480]   is I get to speak with some of the brightest
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.200]   people in the world.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.240]   And as you listen to today's podcast,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.960]   I think you will agree.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.640]   Ed has studied economics and financial conditions
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.320]   in markets and economies going back literally
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.900]   thousands of years.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.000]   And it's fascinating to listen to him lucidly
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.880]   talk through centuries of markets all over the world,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.040]   picking out similarities that others have not considered.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.680]   Ed graduated with honors from Trinity College, Cambridge,
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.160]   and from Oxford University, worked
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.720]   as a mergers and acquisition banker for the Lazar brothers,
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.320]   and later a member of the GMO asset allocation team.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.880]   He currently is a columnist for Reuters.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.320]   He has written two books, Devil Take the Hindmost,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.100]   A History of Financial Speculation,
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.400]   which was published right at the top of the dot-com bubble,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.440]   and more recently, The Price of Time,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.880]   The Real History of Interest, which ironically
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.120]   was published right at the top of the bond bubble.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.160]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Ed Chancellor.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   Welcome to the Bogle Heads-On Investing Podcast, Ed.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.000]   Thank you for having me, Rick.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.380]   You've got such an interesting background.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.040]   You've done so much, and you've written so much.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.960]   Could you tell us a little bit about maybe your schooling?
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.720]   How'd you get into journalism?
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.000]   I understand your family has a history in journalism.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.360]   My grandfather was the Shanghai Bureau Chief of Reuters
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.320]   during the 1930s, during the Sino-Japanese War.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.040]   And then he later went on to become managing director
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.320]   of Reuters.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.240]   And then his son, my uncle Alexander,
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.560]   became editor of the Spectator magazine here.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.920]   I read history at university, decided
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.280]   not to become an academic after my postgraduate degree.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.600]   I spent relatively little of my life
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.560]   in which journalism was my main or sole income stream.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.200]   I made a mistake by going into the corporate finance
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.040]   side of things, what you'd call now M&A banking.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.680]   And that wasn't to my liking.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.640]   And so after a couple of years, I quit.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.160]   I sort of heard these stories about the speculative manias
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.560]   in the past, which I'd never heard about before going
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.600]   into a finance job.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.760]   I looked around, and I read the available literature type--
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.080]   Charles Mackay's extraordinary popular delusions,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.600]   Charles Kindleberger's manias, panics, and crashes.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.640]   And what I thought, being a historian,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.320]   is that I could tell the story of the history
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.480]   of financial speculations that was
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.360]   more narrative-driven than Kindleberger's taxonomy.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.280]   So that's when you decided you were going to write a book.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.920]   And you ended up writing Devil's Take the Hindmost,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.680]   A History of Financial Speculations.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.960]   Well, that book had fortuitous timing.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.120]   I was working on it after I'd left the investment bank
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.480]   Lazard's in about '93 and sort of finished it in late '98,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.800]   just when the dot-com bubble was going sort of completely crazy.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.840]   And it came out in mid '99.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.840]   What was nice about the book when it came out,
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.160]   it got a good reception.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.880]   For the investment world, there were a lot of investors,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.280]   in particular the quant investors--
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.400]   Jeremy Grantham, my old boss at GMO, Cliff Asness at AQR,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.280]   Rob Arnott, who was then at First Quadrant.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.360]   They were all having problems at the time.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.600]   This sort of historical account of speculative manias,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.760]   which drew very strong parallels to what
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.600]   was going on in the US markets in the late 1990s,
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.560]   was catnip to the quant investment community.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.960]   And that really was what introduced me
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.920]   to Jeremy Grantham.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.320]   And then a few years later, I started to work for him.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.840]   So yeah, so that was my first book.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.080]   Just to clarify, in your own words,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.840]   what's the difference between investing and speculating?
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.840]   Lots of people have had a go at trying
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.920]   to distinguish speculation from investment.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.400]   Some are quite boring and prosaic, the distinctions.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.360]   You might say that investment is posited on yield and value
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.840]   and speculation as desire for capital gains,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.920]   not supported by yield or intrinsic value.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   Ben Graham put in the margin of safety,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.160]   that an investment should have a margin of safety.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.360]   The definition I like for distinguishing investment
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.920]   from speculation is by Fred Schwed, Jr.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   in his 1930s book, Where Are All the Customers' Yachts,
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.760]   in which he says that speculation is an attempt,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.080]   usually unsuccessful, to turn a little money into a lot,
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.360]   whereas investment is an attempt, usually successful,
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.480]   to prevent a large pot of money becoming a small one.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.600]   And I think that alludes to both the sort of principle of safety
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.960]   in investment, but I think there's another aspect to it
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.040]   there, which is the speculators are often
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.600]   trying to gain their fortunes fairly quickly,
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.520]   whereas the investor, having gained a fortune,
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.880]   is trying to maintain a yield on it.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.960]   In your book, you talked about signs of speculation,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.120]   and you listed several of them.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.560]   Rumors, fueling a boom, rapid growth of leverage,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.200]   and to create the signs that there might be
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.680]   a speculative bubble going on.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.880]   So what we find, take US stock market in the 1920s.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.360]   There was rapid growth in margin loans.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.520]   And then, if you look historically,
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.720]   the New York Stock Exchange produces data on margin loans,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.520]   and outstanding margin loans tend
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.040]   to rise during the speculative markets or bubble markets.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.560]   If you lever your returns, you're
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.040]   getting higher potential return, but you're also
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.000]   going to face greater potential losses.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.880]   So if a speculative market is characterized
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.320]   by both a sort of greed to enhance returns
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.200]   and a fecklessness towards risk, you
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.600]   would expect to find more leverage.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   You can provide sort of checklists
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.880]   for speculative manias.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.360]   Leverage would be one of them, margin loans.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.200]   The new entrance into stock markets
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.560]   in inexperienced investors, you saw that 1920s, Japan,
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   and 1980s.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.640]   You see it, China, in its recent sort of bubble episodes
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.280]   of 2005 and 2015.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.400]   In our even more recent, our everything bubble,
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.920]   the surge of accounts at Robinhood markets,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.160]   the online broker.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.600]   So that's a new entrance.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.440]   And that's often associated with something,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.040]   a call for the democratization of markets.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.080]   I noticed that speculative bubbles
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.200]   tend to appear at times when communications technologies are
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.800]   improving.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.600]   The first stock market bubble in the UK
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.880]   occurs in the 1690s, which is the same time when
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.320]   there's a proliferation of newspapers and journals,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.480]   and people are meeting to discuss investments
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.240]   in the coffeehouses in London.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.400]   And then again, mid-19th century,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.240]   you get the railway mania, in which the railway is not
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.480]   just an object of speculation, but the railways
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.520]   and the telegraphs are means of transporting
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.920]   the speculative virus.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.360]   And then you get to the 1920s, and you
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.000]   get the telephone, again, as both objects of speculation
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.040]   and means of communicating your orders to the broker.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.200]   Then you get into the dot-com era.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.280]   You get new entrants.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.400]   They're establishing stock market accounts
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.120]   with online brokerages, Charles Schwab, and E-Trade.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.400]   And E-Trade becomes both a big player in the day trading
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.200]   market, but also an object of speculation.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.640]   >> And it seems as though, more recently,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.360]   using social media, a new app that you had on your phone
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.240]   called Robinhood, which would allow you to discuss very
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.080]   quickly and easily, that was adopted by these new entrants.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.120]   >> What Robinhood did, which was novel,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.680]   is it introduced the gaming techniques developed
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.120]   in Las Vegas for the gaming machines in Las Vegas,
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.920]   and introduced them onto an app for investing.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.800]   But they also, as you're probably aware,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.840]   they often leverage stock market loans at 2%.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.440]   And if you had an account with Robinhood,
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.040]   the sort of premium account, you could get 0% cost leverage.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   So your margin loans were no interest charge on them.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.280]   And then you're probably aware that the state of Massachusetts
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.560]   launched a lawsuit against Robinhood's markets
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.040]   in, I think, 2020 or probably 2021,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.760]   in which they accused Robinhood of gamification.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.880]   And you had this massive turnover
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.920]   of trading of these inexperienced investors.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.680]   So this rising turnover in the market
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.520]   is another sort of classic speculative feature,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.240]   at least in stock markets.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.520]   And then, this is more closer to the subject of my book,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.840]   is that you tend to find speculative manias occurring
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.960]   at times when monetary policy is abnormally easy.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.120]   And really, as I point out in the new book,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.840]   even the tulip mania in Holland of the 1630s
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.240]   occurred at a time when there was strong monetary growth
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.400]   in Holland, Dutch public, thanks to the establishment
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.840]   of a new central bank, which attracted
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.200]   foreign capital inflows, and at a time of falling interest
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.840]   rates.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.440]   And the Dutch, for that matter, the speculators in tulip bulbs,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.440]   they were using derivatives to lever their returns.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.000]   I mean, another feature, I think,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.920]   to speak of consumption and luxury spending,
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.880]   that's the sort of social epiphenomenon of the bubble.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.400]   Corruption in public morals or fraud
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.640]   is another common feature.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.680]   I think Walter Badgett, the Victorian journalist,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.840]   says, I'm paraphrasing, that when people are most credulous,
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.960]   when they are most happy, and so to speak,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.840]   high markets at times offer opportunities
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.880]   for ingenious mendacity.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.200]   J.K. Galbraith sort of took the Badgett insight
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.680]   and turned it into his notion of the bezel,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.480]   the illusory increase in wealth that
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.760]   occurs to inspective bubbles.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   And the original term bubble is a fraud, a con.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.240]   That's what it means.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   It's an illusion of wealth that is deliberately dishonest.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.360]   And so the term South Sea Bubble,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.680]   which was when it came into popular usage,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   referring to the stock market bubble of 1720,
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.440]   really means the South Sea Con.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.160]   John Cassidy of The New Yorker wrote
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.120]   an account of the internet bubble published
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.280]   after the bubble burst called Dot Con, C-O-N.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.680]   And then looking far forward to where we are today,
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.240]   you see the crypto market, most speculative market ever
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.200]   created.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.160]   It made the tulip mania of the 1630s
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.960]   look positively conservative.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.480]   And you see what looked to be possibly fraudulent behavior
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.000]   in the crypto world and surrounding
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.440]   the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.320]   So one of the things you should look out for in a bubble
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.680]   is evidence of corruption and malfeasance.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.120]   We saw that going back to the 1990s
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.880]   that it was pretty clear that US companies
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.840]   were misstating their earnings and manipulating their earnings.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.640]   And then after that dot-com bubble burst,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.920]   then you had these scandals that you remember
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.280]   at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.640]   And then after that, you get the liar loans
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.280]   that push up the US real estate market in the bubble that
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.920]   peaks in 2006.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.400]   So corruption is an inherent feature of the bubble.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.440]   Let's go on to your latest book, The Price of Time,
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.480]   The Real Story of Interest.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.880]   At the beginning of your book, you
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.960]   go back to the history of interest.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.200]   My opening words of the book was, in the beginning
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.680]   was the loan, and the loan carried interest.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.280]   What I'm saying is that right at the dawn of recorded history,
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.400]   we have evidence of lending taking place at interest.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.320]   So this makes interest, alongside the act of lending,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.640]   the oldest financial practice, which Mesopotamians
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.520]   were lending at interest long before they'd
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.680]   invented the wheel, millennia before the Greeks had actually
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.320]   come up with coined money.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.120]   And then if we look into the etymologies of the word
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.720]   interest in ancient languages, they
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.200]   tend to be related to the offspring of livestock.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.120]   So there is a sort of what you might
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.720]   call the fructification theory of interest,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.120]   that some are lending an object, lending your capital.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.880]   We know that in Mesopotamia, there were loans of barley,
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.120]   grain, and presumably there were loans of cattle, and goats,
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.000]   and sheep.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.680]   And the idea was that some of the growth of the livestock,
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.400]   the offspring, would be returned to the lender.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.680]   The first law code we had, the Code of Hammurabi,
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.360]   is actually largely involved with financial regulation
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.840]   in determining what the maximum rates of interest
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.480]   and when rates should be forgiven.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.120]   And Mesopotamians also had these debt jubilees,
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.200]   which meant the debt was forgiven
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.520]   at the onset of a new reign.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.080]   And the Israelites, they took a dim view of interest
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.000]   that I think the ancient Hebrew word for interest
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.160]   is neshek, which means the bite of a serpent.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.880]   As we know, the Old Testament forbids lending
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.240]   to each other at interest, but not to outsiders.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.680]   Put this very succinctly, in a primarily pre-industrial,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.520]   pre-capitalist economy, the danger
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.600]   is that farmers will borrow at interest
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.880]   and that the interest rate compounds,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.120]   the interest compounds at a high level,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.640]   driving people into debt, into high levels of debt,
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.240]   leading them to lose their farms,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.160]   or even in cases in the ancient world of going into slavery.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:18.760]   So I think that's the ancient strictures against interest,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.200]   or what was called usury, that continue into the Middle Ages
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.640]   by the Catholic Church, which really
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.320]   takes the position of Greek philosopher Aristotle, who
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.640]   complained about interest.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:37.040]   And so that continues through to, let's say,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.200]   the 15th, 16th century.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.400]   But then as you come to a more capitalist era,
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.040]   then it's realized that merchants
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.800]   need capital to trade with, and that they're not
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.920]   going to get the money unless they're
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.240]   often paid some interest.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.360]   And then it's also seen as fair that the lender should
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.600]   have a share in the profits of the borrower.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.440]   And even in the Middle Ages, before that was conceded,
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.600]   it was accepted that if the lender was taking risk,
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.880]   say, for instance, lending to a merchant who
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.440]   was going on a sea voyage and the ship might go down,
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.760]   that those type of risky loans would carry
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.080]   a legitimate rate of interest.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.960]   In short, by the birth of capitalism,
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.000]   interest was grudgingly accepted.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.360]   And then there becomes a sort of new idea
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.640]   that comes in point with the justification for capitalism
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.400]   or a market system in Adam Smith,
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.560]   is that everyone should pursue their own interest.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.920]   And the acceptance of interest by the 18th century
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.160]   is uniform.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.080]   And as the title of my book says,
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.280]   interest is a price placed on time.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.880]   And we need to put a place on time in the finance world
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.480]   for a number of reasons, because all our actions take place
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.760]   across time, what are technically
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.200]   called intertemporal, whether we're lending or valuing.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.880]   And you need to put a price on time for capitalism
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.840]   to make sense.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.680]   We tend to think of capital being something solid,
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.000]   but in fact, really, capital is a flow of future income,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.800]   because you can have anything.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.080]   Any object that doesn't generate income
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.720]   is not really capital from an economic perspective.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.400]   It might have value, but it's not capital.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.120]   It's only when it's in an income-producing function
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.200]   that it becomes capital.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.120]   And the capital is the present value
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.280]   of the future income stream.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.960]   Now, this was pointed out by English writers
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.240]   in the 17th century.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.880]   If you don't have a discount rate,
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.520]   if you don't use a discount rate,
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.880]   then it's impossible to distinguish
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.160]   the value of one acre of land from 20 acres of land.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.840]   Everything has an infinite value.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:06.360]   So if you think about it, the whole notion of capitalism
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.560]   is actually meaningless without its underlying
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.640]   foundational support of the rate of interest.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.040]   That is the main underlying argument in my book,
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.720]   is that we have really lost sight
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.400]   of the importance of interest and how it both affects
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.960]   valuation, risk assessment, allocation of capital, savings,
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.720]   and so forth.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.640]   The system, our capitalist system,
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.000]   is only given some type of coherence
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   by there being a rate of interest.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.200]   You talk several places in the book
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.480]   about what is an equitable rate of interest.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.280]   And you've already alluded to in your comments
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.360]   that there is a minimum rate of interest
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.480]   for what the lenders are willing to accept
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.320]   for the price of capital over time.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.240]   But then you've also talked about interest rates
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.320]   that are too high and ends up causing collapse.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.880]   So there's some equitable rate.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.160]   I think of interest rates as sort of Goldilocks
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.320]   and the three bears.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   Three bowls of porridge, one's too hot, the other's too cold,
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.880]   and the other's just about fine.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:23.360]   If you go back to the era before the proliferation of banking,
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   so in Britain, say, roughly in the 17th century,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.800]   where an act of lending would be sort of the equivalent of me
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.760]   lending you a book.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.960]   I'm actually lending you, in effect, a physical object
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.360]   that is of finite supply.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.120]   The state shouldn't try and make laws about interest,
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.240]   but let the interest find its natural price
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.720]   or its natural level.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:50.440]   So that becomes the first notion of a natural rate of interest.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.160]   But when you get into a world where banks create money
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.120]   through the acts of lending, and then you
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.480]   get into a world where money is no longer
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.840]   redeemable or convertible into precious metal,
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.040]   and you have a monetary system in which the central bank is
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.760]   in effect determining what at least short-term interest
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.800]   rates are, therefore on what long-term rates are,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.080]   then the interest rate is no longer,
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.480]   so to speak, market-determined or is no longer necessarily
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.000]   in line with the natural rate.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.280]   And what the central bankers have adopted over the last 100
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.920]   years or so is a rule of thumb that
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.640]   says as long as there's no deflation
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.520]   and as long as inflation is kept around what's
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.360]   now the 2% target, then we have discovered
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.400]   the market's natural rate.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.600]   And I argue in the book that this
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.760]   is mistaken because there are some periods when consumer
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.680]   prices are declining for particularly benign reasons,
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.120]   such as improvements in productivity
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.440]   or falling trading goods prices as China starts selling stuff
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.400]   to everyone, and that these are not necessarily bad
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.920]   and not necessarily an indication of where
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.160]   the natural rate should be.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.720]   You should look to other things, too.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.960]   You should look whether there's strong credit growth
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.080]   or whether there's strong asset price bubbles
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.880]   and whether the financial sector seems
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.000]   to be growing very strongly.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.400]   Those would all be indications that lending
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.320]   is being done at what key players
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.280]   in the financial system would consider
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.200]   to be a very low rate, or at least a rate that's
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.120]   very favorable to them.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   You also talk about ultra low rates, zero interest rates,
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.240]   negative interest rates created by central banks.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.960]   They're trying to get the economy going and get people
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.520]   to borrow money, but it causes unintended consequences.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.640]   I'll preface my comments with two observations.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.440]   First of all, there is a notion that interest actually
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.120]   emanates from within the individual in their so-called
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.440]   time preference.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.760]   You prefer to have--
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.360]   which we express with the phrase a bird in the hand
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.400]   is worth two in the bush.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.520]   You prefer-- human beings, by and large,
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.240]   prefer to have something now than at some date in the future.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.920]   Therefore, future goods and services
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.520]   are worth less to you than your current goods and services.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.560]   So the interest is the discount between the current
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.760]   and the future price.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.200]   And so according to some views, is that interest
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.440]   or in what Irving Fisher, the American economist,
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.280]   will crystallize in patience is an inherent feature
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.480]   of human psychology, of mankind.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:35.200]   So to set rates at zero is to suggest that mankind no longer
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.280]   has a time preference.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.200]   To set rates at a negative level is to put
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   the price of time in reverse.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.760]   It's a concept that belongs to Lewis Carroll and Alice
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.800]   in Wonderland.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.520]   It sets a position of normality back to front.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.440]   So that, I think, is the sort of strangest thing
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.400]   about the era of zero negative rates.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.760]   It's against human nature.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.520]   As I mentioned to you earlier, it
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.240]   undermines the fundaments of the capitalist system.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   And in later chapters of the book,
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.160]   I discuss in different chapters the role
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.840]   of interest in valuation.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.400]   I discuss the role of interest in the allocation of capital
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.480]   and interest as an inducement to save,
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.400]   interest as a measure of risk, interest
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.520]   as a cost of leverage or the cost of finance
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.440]   for the financial sector, and interest
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.520]   affecting capital flows.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.000]   And all those aspects, all those different features
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   of the financial system, were sort of knocked out of whack
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.640]   by the end of 2021.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.040]   Global debt levels have massively
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.400]   increased since the 2008 financial crisis.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.440]   US stock market trading on record valuations,
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.040]   the so-called everything bubble.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.760]   You get misallocation of capital into the most absurd venture
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.640]   capital and technology ventures.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.840]   Then you get the zombie companies.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.240]   You get a legacy of a decade or more of chasing yield.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.000]   So declining credit standards or underwriting standards
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.040]   and the growth of debt.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.360]   So I think you put all this together
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.200]   and you say the low interest rate immediately
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.920]   after the global financial crisis,
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.160]   it obviously lessened the impact of the crisis,
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.680]   mitigated unemployment, and helped the financial sector
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.240]   hold together.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.120]   So those are the plus signs.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   But then by continuing the same policies for a further, what,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.960]   13 years, you then get these other problems.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.760]   And my main beef with the policymaking community
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.640]   is they focus only on the immediate benefits
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.160]   of the low rate era and the quantitative easing
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.920]   after the collapse of Lehman Brothers,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.680]   where it averted, as they're keen to say,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.560]   another Great Depression.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.920]   And then they overlook the role of the very low interest
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.720]   rates after the dot-com bust, when US Fed funds rate fell
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.560]   to 1%, which appears to have contributed
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.520]   to igniting a major fact in driving the real estate boom.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.920]   And also the low interest rates encouraged investment
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.760]   in the subprime securities, which had a higher yield.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.640]   So after the crisis, then you have all these other problems
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.720]   that the policymakers, to my mind,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.520]   they don't pay attention to.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.600]   And there's one other interesting aspect of this.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.360]   And we're seeing it is a rise in inequality.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.920]   And social unrest comes along with this.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.840]   Yeah, so I mean, think about it.
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.240]   If you have some assets, a house, a stock market
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.160]   portfolio, a bond portfolio, and the interest rates go down,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.200]   everything else being equal, value of your house goes up,
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.320]   value of your bonds go up, and value--
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.320]   so you are richer.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.240]   You're better off, at least in the valuation of all your assets.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.600]   Whereas, as you know, when valuations go up,
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.000]   they're more expensive to buy.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.320]   So a person trying to buy a house, get on the housing
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.560]   ladder, has more problems, obviously,
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.960]   when the house price is higher.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.080]   And actually, valuations go up, expected returns, as you know,
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.960]   decline.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   So actually, it's very good if you've
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.280]   got a fortune to benefit.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.360]   But if you're trying to acquire a fortune,
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.520]   it's a different matter.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.280]   And then, as I point out, and perhaps I'm
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.920]   being a bit hypocritical, because I've
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.280]   spent half my life working in the finance area.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.720]   But the very low interest rates benefit
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.000]   people working in finance.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.120]   Not your conventional banker, because yield curves are flat,
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.200]   and it's difficult for conventional banks
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.320]   to make a profit from their lending and borrowing.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   But if you're more on Wall Street,
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.040]   if you're helping companies do their leveraged stock buybacks
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.760]   or leveraged buyouts, or just if you're running an investment
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.680]   firm and your markets are going up
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.960]   and you're being paid a percentage of that,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.040]   then what you see after the global financial crisis
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.840]   is that despite the fact it was a financial crisis,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.560]   you see that the role of the financial sector in the US
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.960]   actually increases.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.760]   And contributions to profits rise to a record high.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.920]   I show a chart in the book showing
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.760]   that the share of wealth owned by the--
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.360]   I think it's the top 1% of the population--
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.400]   seems to track the inverse of the long bond yield.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.280]   So as long bond yields come down,
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.240]   the wealth of the richer section of population rises.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.680]   As you're probably aware, there was this book that came out,
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.040]   I think, 2013 by the French economist Thomas Piketty,
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.120]   where he said that when rates of return
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.800]   were higher than growth, then inequality increased.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.080]   But I say when the rate of interest is below growth,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.240]   then actually inequality rises.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.720]   Historically, the Gilded Age, which
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.120]   was a period of these great trusts being put together
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.360]   by J.P. Morgan, funded with debt,
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.160]   creating the robber barons, it's no coincidence
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.560]   this occurred at a time of very low interest rates,
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.400]   just like the great financial fortunes of recent years.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.360]   What you're saying does make the case for a market timing
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.800]   strategy, but we know that that's very difficult to do.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.520]   You have to make two decisions when you do market timing.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.160]   You have to decide when it's time to get out,
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.960]   and then you have to decide when it's time to get back in.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.480]   I agree.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.600]   And obviously, if one comes from the sort of active investment
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.480]   market timing side, one's always going
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.080]   to look for arguments to justify that position
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.520]   against the passive investment.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.080]   If you pay taxes on capital gains,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.840]   that's an extra problem.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:00.560]   What worries me, in particular, about passive investment
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.240]   or the growth of passive investment over the last
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.480]   decade, I mean, in some part, perhaps just
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.200]   to do with growth of ETFs and technology,
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.160]   another thing that I think was probably pushing
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.480]   it was that when you move into these bubble markets created
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.960]   by the ultra low interest rates, it
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.000]   becomes extremely difficult for the active investor
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.880]   with a value bias to keep up with markets,
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.760]   particularly when those markets, as happened in the US,
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:35.400]   become heavily concentrated in a relatively small basket
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   of stocks.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.200]   And so you get this sort of negative alpha drawdown
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.840]   going on year after year after year.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.400]   And then it becomes a simple decision
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.920]   for the risk-averse investment committee to say,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.560]   hey, active doesn't work, so let's take our money
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.160]   from active, put it into passive.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.760]   And as you make that shift, you're
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:02.360]   selling the active position, the active value stock positions,
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.280]   which is everything else being equal, lowering their price.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.120]   And then you're putting it into market cap weighted positions
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.040]   in the index, which reinforces the demand for the large cap
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.960]   stocks that have already increased their position.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.680]   So you get a lot of, if you will,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.920]   blind capital going around.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:30.440]   I see this as indirectly related to the easy money conditions.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.600]   I didn't include it as a chart in my book,
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.960]   but there is a chart which I saw that Nomura, a Japanese broker,
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:44.440]   put out in 2016, which showed that the active alpha
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.960]   and negative alpha roughly tracked
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.760]   the course of interest rates, so that as interest rates were
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:56.240]   falling, this was a very bad time in aggregate for active.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.160]   The market's a cap weighted, and most active managers
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.560]   tend to be equal weighted.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:08.000]   And because of that, they're investing the money more broadly
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.880]   across the market.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.440]   So they may have 15 names in their portfolio,
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.160]   but it's closer to an equal weighting
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.400]   rather than a cap weighting.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   So as you get lower and lower interest rates pushing up,
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.320]   particularly in the US market, these large cap growth stocks,
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.120]   then you've got not only is it a value growth issue for them,
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.880]   but it's also there's no breath in the market,
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.400]   so that their names are not benefiting.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.040]   I've seen research from the quant shops, AQR,
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.920]   and research affiliates, and they both
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.800]   argued that value, US value, but also
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.320]   value in other parts of the world,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.800]   but let's stick with US value, was not at a record discount,
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:55.200]   but a close to record discount by the late 2020
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.160]   when value rebounded.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.720]   Now, the value was at the greatest discount
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.000]   at the peak of the dotcom bubble when long-term valuation
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.400]   measures like Shiller BE or Topin's Q
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.480]   were at its highest level ever.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.280]   And then you get to 2020, US market on Shiller PE
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.240]   is its second highest level with the exception of the dotcom
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.120]   bubble, and value is once again at a discount.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.440]   And I imagine that active managers in the US
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.760]   are looking at early retirement.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.520]   No, not this year, quite frankly.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.360]   What has happened in this last rally,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.280]   I think, is you look back over the last six months
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.600]   and active managers have outperformed
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.720]   because of the breadth of the market.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.200]   Active managers tend to sit on a bit of cash.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.320]   Well, that too, the bit of cash, but also
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.560]   because of the higher interest rates and the valuation
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.320]   equation of long-term, way out there,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.760]   future earnings of large-cap growth stocks,
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:01.080]   they came down a lot, and the breadth of the market
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.840]   broadening out into other names, and particularly value names
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.960]   and value industries like energy and materials
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.800]   have caused the active managers to outperform.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.240]   I was saying that in 2020, that was an adder.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.840]   Obviously, 2021 market is a very strong market, too.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.760]   And so last year, yeah.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.520]   Last year is-- heralds the return both of value
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.040]   and active management.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.400]   And if the sort of numera correlation between interest
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.120]   rates and alpha hold, I did a talk at some investment
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.520]   conference in Germany last summer,
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.680]   which I showed the numera charters to the value
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.520]   investors saying that all hope was not quite lost.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.880]   Again, getting back to our discussion about market timing,
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.920]   very difficult to do it.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:00.200]   And even if your data says, OK, now the market is overvalued,
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.560]   you should begin to pull back, you
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.280]   could be much too early.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.040]   And that causes other problems, not only
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.840]   for the professional managers, but for individuals
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.280]   who now have to figure out how to get back in.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.800]   But should you invest in growth?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.200]   Should you go to a value tilt?
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:25.360]   Again, if you're going to do that, you can't time it.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.480]   It's very difficult to time these things.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.200]   So just going down the middle of the road
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.800]   is really what the Boglehead philosophy is.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.280]   I'm aware of the timing issue.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.880]   Obviously, having worked in an investment firm
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.320]   when our models weren't necessarily
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.360]   producing timely or even very accurate forecasts.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.840]   Having said that, to go back to what
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.360]   I was mentioning earlier about the credit cycle model,
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.160]   or even a general understanding of the impact
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.600]   of ultra low interest rates, which
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.800]   is what my book is about, I think
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.440]   it's important for an investor, even if they're committed
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.080]   to only using index products for asset allocation purposes,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:15.240]   to understand the environment in which they're operating.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.200]   Let's take the most extreme example
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   and say we were Japanese investors in the 1980s.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.280]   Obviously, it wouldn't have been a very good idea
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:31.320]   in the summer of '85 to take your money out
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.000]   of the Japanese stock market.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.480]   However, what you would observe during that period,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.520]   first of all, you'd see interest rates kept low.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:46.040]   And you'd see, following from that, strong credit growth
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.080]   and a real estate bubble and rising valuations in the stock
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:49.640]   market.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.400]   And you'd have seen this phenomenon
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.440]   of zytec, or financial engineering,
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.680]   in which profits are really being created speciously
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:03.560]   through direct and indirect exposure of Japanese corporations
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.240]   to the stock market or the real estate markets, which
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.000]   is being put through the P&L, sometimes goosed
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.840]   with a bit of extra leverage.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.920]   So you'd see the zytec.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.960]   And then you'd notice towards the latter years of the bubble,
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.200]   you'd see inflation coming back in the system.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.760]   And you would observe the Bank of Japan
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.800]   tightening and putting up interest rates very sharply
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.640]   in late '89 and into 1990.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.440]   You'd have heard the governor of the Bank of Japan
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.960]   saying expressly that his desire to bring the real estate
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.200]   bubble to an end.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.640]   And if you knew your financial history,
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.240]   you'd be aware that the end of periods of asset price
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.360]   bubbles, of real estate bubbles after strong credit growth,
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.600]   were likely to be fairly calamitous,
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.440]   as turned out to be the case in Japan.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.320]   Now, given that the Japanese stock market was trading
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.520]   on a price earnings ratio of around 75 times the time,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.800]   and now, we're speaking, what, 33 years later,
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.440]   the stock market still hasn't returned to the Nikkei peak
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:14.360]   of December 31, '89, that is a strong case, I think.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.360]   It's probably the strongest case you can make,
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.480]   because I'm obviously giving you an example where actually
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.080]   being out of the market for a long time
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.120]   has paid off, at least getting out close to the top.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.920]   I think that it behoves one to understand the environment
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.880]   in which you're investing.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.520]   Yeah, and I suppose I would say quite strongly
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.600]   to adapt your asset allocation at least
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.440]   to extreme divergences from normal conditions.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.080]   I also interviewed Antti Ilmenen from AQR,
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.720]   and his book, Investing Among Low Expected Returns,
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.480]   basically said the same case.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:59.240]   In the extreme, if you were to do a little market timing,
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.960]   you may benefit.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.720]   In fact, there's a video out there
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.600]   by Jack Bogle talking about his own portfolio
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.800]   and how he incorporated this.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.480]   Bogle got slightly tempered his US exposure in the late 1990s.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.600]   Correct, by quite a bit.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.480]   Now, realize he says in the video
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.400]   that he did it in 1995 when he was having
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.720]   some very big health issues, and then he
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.760]   had to have his heart transplant in January of 1996.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.960]   So that had a big factor on him trying
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.080]   to prepare his portfolio if he didn't make it.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.240]   He did say that in the video.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.000]   But he did make the case that things
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.760]   were getting to an extreme.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.040]   Now, remember, he was four years early on that call
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.960]   and was out of the market generally.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.720]   He said he was at 25% equity.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.480]   He went from 75% to 25% for four years
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.080]   while the market went up.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:58.560]   And it does create problems for investors
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.000]   watching the market go up and up and up
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.560]   and maybe believe they make a mistake
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.760]   and get back in at even a higher price.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:10.480]   My problem with market timing is market timing.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.720]   If you're not right on your timing,
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:20.320]   it could lead to exponentially larger errors in your timing.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.560]   Look, I understand that.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.120]   Are you familiar with the work of Andrew Smithers, who's
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:26.880]   an English--
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.480]   it's a British economist, sort of city of London economist,
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.680]   now retired.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.640]   Came out with a book roughly the same time
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.880]   as Robert Schiller's Irrational Exuberance
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.400]   called Valuing Wall Street.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.880]   And Smithers uses replacement cost.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.480]   And the idea being that the market, US market,
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.880]   has traditionally traded, I think,
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.960]   slight discount to its replacement cost valuation,
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.680]   otherwise known as Topin's Q. And you
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.440]   can go to Smithers' website.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.640]   And you can download his Topin's Q.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.000]   It tells you the same story as the Schiller PE,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.360]   but from a different angle.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.920]   But Topin's Q, for the last 28 years,
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.320]   has hardly hit fair value.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.040]   And the GMO methodology, which is not quite similar in its way
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:24.360]   to the Schiller PE, but works on a mean reversion of valuation
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.960]   and of profit margins, that it was early
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.800]   the forecast with its negative signal in the late 1990s
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.120]   when it was developed.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:40.560]   But then it produces outstanding rankings of investment returns.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.360]   In 2000, the 10-year forecast, the rankings
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:48.480]   of value, and emerging, and US broad stock market, and ether.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.800]   I mean, if you look at them, it's almost--
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.120]   it's sort of spookily good.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.440]   It's so spookily good, it might almost
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.160]   persuade you to believe in forecasting.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.080]   The forecasts that were then made by GMO--
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:05.560]   the team I was part of in 2009, over the next 10 years,
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.320]   were decisively inaccurate.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.160]   So that moment of glory didn't last.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.760]   It's the old saying that it works until it doesn't.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.080]   Yeah, and I think that's true.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.760]   I have to say, I think that's an investment truism.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.040]   And I reckon Bill Bernstein would agree with me on this,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.280]   is that there's no permanent investment truism.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.920]   And therefore, really, one sign of a good investor
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.680]   is a sort of flexibility to adopt different methodologies
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.800]   or different ways of looking at the world.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.920]   Think of it this way.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.440]   You have Ben Graham with his, if you will, hard value
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.160]   methodology, and it's a price to book, and earnings.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.520]   And then you have Warren Buffett adapting
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:53.280]   that into a sort of more of a sustainability of ROE,
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.560]   or what we would now call a sort of quality focus,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.600]   moving from Ben Graham pure value to a sort of quality
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.360]   value proposition.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.040]   That's all great for people who do this maybe for a living.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.080]   And I would say that people who do this for a living, maybe
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:15.320]   the top 1% of those people could actually do that.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.640]   The other 99 basically have the title of portfolio manager,
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.800]   and they're pushing buttons and following some model.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.320]   But there is the 1% of the professionals
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.560]   who have this belief.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.800]   The problem with individual investors
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.760]   is they're always going to be late to the game.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.920]   They're the ones who pick up the model right at the end
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.000]   when it's got its last maybe correct forecast in it,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.480]   and then it all goes haywire.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.920]   And then they wait for the next model to come along that
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.440]   has worked for the last 10 years,
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.360]   and they jump on that model, which
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.480]   is right at the end of it.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.520]   Individual investors have this problem.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.240]   I know.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.320]   I mean, it is, and you see it.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.160]   And I think I've even seen reports in the Wall Street
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.040]   Journal over the last couple of years
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.240]   with retail investors piling into the market in 2020, '21,
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.920]   and then the market cracks.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.520]   And then suddenly they're getting out of the market
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.720]   just before the market's about to rebound.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.040]   And I think that if you're going to do market timing,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.520]   you not only need to understand the valuation aspects,
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.440]   you need to understand certain extraneous other factors that
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.880]   might influence or help market timing work, of which
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.200]   I think the monetary situation probably
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.400]   is a fairly important one.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.880]   And then you need to have some confidence in your position,
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.720]   and you need to have a strong contrarian aspect
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.600]   to be willing to go against the market.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.840]   And I think you probably also, going back
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.920]   to your question of whether you're out of the market,
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.560]   you also need to be able to reassess your decisions
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.160]   and, if necessary, overturn them.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.920]   Are you asking a lot from the typical individual investor,
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.400]   or--
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.600]   Quite a lot.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.880]   Or you could do the Vogelhead version of it,
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.840]   which is to come up with an asset allocation,
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:06.320]   call it 60% stocks, 40% bonds, be super diversified
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.560]   into global equities on your stock side,
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.600]   US index fund, international index fund,
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.960]   be diversified on the bond side as well,
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.200]   do an occasional rebalancing, which
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.920]   does pick up these valuation differences over time,
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.240]   and then stay the course.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.800]   And it ends up being the default model that
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.280]   ends up pushing these individual investors who actually
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.960]   do this model up into the 90th percentile
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.320]   as far as rates of return.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.000]   So you're never going to be number one,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.280]   but you're going to be up there in the 90th percentile.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.320]   It's always quite dangerous to make generalizations
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:45.120]   of investment based on sort of a back testing of the positions.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.280]   I'm not saying the Vogelhead portfolio, but let's--
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:47.800]   No, no, no.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.600]   I just wanted to explain what the Vogelhead kind of--
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.560]   how it ended up defaulting to that.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.120]   In other words, the people who are the Vogelheads
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.360]   are very intelligent.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.520]   They study everything.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.440]   They read everything.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.040]   They're going to read your books.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.600]   If not, I've already read your books.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.840]   They are into everything.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.960]   We're talking some of the smartest people I know,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.320]   much smarter than me.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.720]   They've come to the conclusion that, yes, there
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.240]   may be people out there who can do this, but it isn't me.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.120]   And so what do I need to do for me that works for me?
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.400]   And that's where you end up with the Vogelhead philosophy.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:28.560]   And we come off this period of very strong US bull market
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.360]   and reasonably strong, but obviously not quite so good,
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.920]   global markets, with the US market ending up
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:40.640]   at a close to record high valuation at the end of 2020.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:45.520]   You've also had this period in which this 40-year bull market
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.360]   in bonds, in which nominal bond yields declined
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.320]   around the world to their lowest level in history
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.160]   and negative in some countries.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.640]   If you remember, $18 trillion worth
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.120]   of bonds cited by Bloomberg with negative yields.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.640]   And during this period, the correlation
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:10.360]   between bonds and equities is not stable at all times.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.840]   Historically.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.520]   But there seems to be the case that since we moved
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.600]   into the recent bubble era, which
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.640]   we might take collapse of the long-term capital management
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.480]   hedge fund in September '98, that
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.320]   was a period in which there was quite
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.880]   a strong inverse correlation between bonds and equities
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.640]   so that as you were losing something on the equity side,
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.560]   you were getting something on the bond.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.320]   And that may have been due to the fact
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.640]   that the markets were aware of a sort of deflationary risk
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.240]   from all the debt and the bubbles that were being created.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.800]   And perhaps they were also aware that whenever
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.400]   the markets faced trouble, the Fed
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.840]   was likely to cut rates that would be good for bonds.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.760]   And the markets were aware that inflation pressures would
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.000]   appear to be in abeyance.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.120]   And therefore, there wasn't much of an inflationary.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.200]   So that was a very nice period on the whole
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.840]   to have your classic automated 60/40 portfolio.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.320]   But you're aware in the 1970s, you
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.960]   have a positive correlation between the bonds
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:11.760]   and the equities.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.400]   And then inflation is permanently
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:18.320]   eroding the value of the bonds and temporarily depressing
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.160]   the valuations on equities.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.720]   But let me stop for a second.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.720]   That is a good point.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.560]   You see, where we are right now in history--
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.160]   and we've been here now for, well,
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.640]   since the financial crisis-- is bonds
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.880]   have given us a negative real return.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.360]   And that's before taxes.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.600]   And we all eventually have to pay taxes.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.280]   This is a real dilemma.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.680]   We are losing purchasing power with every bond that we hold.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.000]   Unless you're going to buy BBB or BBB-rated bonds where
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.640]   you get a high enough yield or you buy Treasury Inflation
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.920]   Protected Securities, we're there.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.680]   Only recently, the interest portion of it
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.600]   has been high enough so that maybe after you pay your taxes,
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.560]   maybe you break out even.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.200]   So bonds are a real dilemma right now
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.720]   for people who are actually trying to grow real wealth
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.720]   after taxes and inflation in their portfolio.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.120]   First of all, if you think it's difficult to time equities,
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.840]   try timing bonds.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.160]   There's another project I had at GMO.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.040]   I looked at our bond forecast.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:19.360]   I back-tested it over the previous century
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.200]   and found that it had been right on about three occasions
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:30.000]   and it would often be wrong for sort of multi-decade periods.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.120]   And then you actually realize-- and if you ever
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.760]   move in the circle of fixed income investors,
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.840]   is that they never-- they really don't talk about market timing.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.960]   Equity guys, you know, do talk--
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.680]   It's interesting.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.120]   You're absolutely right about that.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.440]   That's interesting you say that.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.080]   Yeah, there are no--
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.480]   I think I made a presentation saying there are no value
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.560]   investors in the bond world.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.480]   But the thing is, we also know--
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.680]   and let's throw ourselves back in time
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:59.880]   to the previous period in which interest rates in the--
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.800]   let's stick with the US-- in interest rates
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.400]   were kept at an extremely low, manipulated down
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.840]   to a very extremely low position during the Second World War,
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.040]   where I can't quite remember, but I think sort of T-bills
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.880]   were fixed at 25 to 50 basis points
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.240]   and a handful of basis points above that for the centuries.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.880]   And the yield curve was manipulated.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:25.360]   And then you come out of the Second World War,
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.520]   pent-up demand, and you get a surge of inflation.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.440]   It's only there for a year or so,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.720]   but then the inflation comes down.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.160]   And you could say there are certain similarities to today,
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.880]   although I actually think that the US,
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.600]   from an investment perspective and an economic perspective,
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.680]   is in a much better position after the Second World War
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.800]   because the debt had been paid down
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.080]   due to the Great Depression.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.280]   There was a lot of suppressed consumer demand,
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.520]   and valuations were quite low on the equity side.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.640]   So it wasn't sort of post-bubble valuation
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.000]   probably to deal with.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.360]   Anyhow, if you're a treasury investor then,
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:08.720]   you actually have to deal with 35 years of rising yields
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.200]   until they peak in the early 1980s.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   And by the end of that period,
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:18.440]   bonds are known as certificates of confiscation.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.480]   If you and I went back in a sort of time capsule
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.280]   and someone to argue a balanced portfolio
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.280]   would be having equities and nominal bonds,
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.840]   you know, 40% nominal treasury bonds,
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.360]   they would think you were completely mad.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.400]   Having said that, we do know that there are,
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.440]   historically, these bond markets,
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:45.080]   their cycles have gone in roughly three to four decades,
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.360]   sometimes five decades.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.200]   The bond bear market after the Second World War
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.680]   lasted 35 years.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.920]   And then the bond bull market that followed it
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.680]   lasted 40 years.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.600]   We know now that there is a strong incentive,
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.640]   as strong, if not stronger incentive,
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.000]   for governments to push for keeping interest rates
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.880]   below the level of inflation,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.640]   if only to facilitate the reduction
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.720]   in the real burden of government debt.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:21.280]   The idea of negative real interest rates
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.520]   is here to stay for a very long time.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.680]   It becomes policy going forward.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.160]   And this is a real dilemma for investors
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.760]   who are on fixed income.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.600]   And we have this saying here in the US,
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.680]   as you get older, you should buy more fixed income,
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.320]   your age in bonds.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.520]   And I'm not so sure that that's true.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.760]   It's just maybe a bad idea,
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.240]   given this world that we're in.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.880]   - From a subpractical investing perspective,
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:53.480]   compared to where we were at the beginning of last year,
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.680]   is that the tips of inflation-protected,
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.880]   treasury inflation-protected securities
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.680]   now have a positive real yield.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.160]   At the beginning of last year,
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.640]   they were in negative territory,
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.720]   or at the end of 2021.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.600]   And they took quite a big hit, the tips.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.440]   - They did.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.120]   - Their yields, real yields, moved with nominal yields.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.280]   - Yes, that's true.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.520]   But now, as we stand today,
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:25.280]   they are at, short-term tips are at 2%,
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.440]   like a one-year tip for us here in the US are at 2% yield,
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.720]   and longer-term tips are at 1.5.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.040]   So you could actually invest in tips today,
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.280]   and you will have a real return
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.440]   on your fixed income portfolio.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.000]   - One of the arguments of my book
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.640]   is that the ultra-low interest rate environment
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.480]   has created a bubble economy,
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:51.160]   and contributed to misallocation of capital,
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.360]   whether it's in your pie-in-the-sky
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.440]   venture capital investments,
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.360]   or in your zombie companies.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.920]   And it's also contributed to a lot of financial engineering,
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.640]   and companies, particularly in the US,
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.360]   having levered themselves up,
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.920]   and obviously a great private equity boom.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:15.920]   And then a decline in savings, in actual savings,
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.280]   discouraged by the low interest rates,
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.400]   and also savings discouraged by, frankly,
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.360]   the extraordinarily strong position returns in the market.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.800]   If people are getting, you know,
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.360]   7% or 8% real returns from a balanced portfolio,
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:35.480]   there's less encouragement to put money away.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.800]   And so I think the upshot of all that
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.040]   is that it will probably, so this is not a forecast,
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:45.760]   but there's a reasonable chance, I would say,
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.280]   that we are about to go through a period
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.400]   of continued low growth.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.200]   Bear in mind that since the global financial crisis,
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.480]   US and European GDP growth
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.920]   has been at sort of near-record low levels.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.480]   And I argue in the book
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.920]   that the accommodating monetary policy,
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.120]   and the resistance to allowing the market to clear
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.040]   by monetary policy, has contributed to that.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.840]   If this were to continue, that low growth,
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:19.280]   or even exacerbate that trend over the next decade,
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.800]   and if, as we've already mentioned,
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.480]   the authorities have a strong incentive
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.240]   to keep interest rates below the level of inflation,
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.480]   policy of financial repression,
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.120]   as we had after the Second World War,
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   then I think your 1.5% on TIPS today
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.800]   will look like an outstanding bargain.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.560]   You know, for US retirement investors,
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.920]   I think TIPS should be a core holding,
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.800]   and probably, to my mind, probably bigger
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:54.480]   than the 40% allocated in the average portfolio.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.640]   - Thank you so much, Ed, for being on the show today.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.440]   We've talked about a lot of things, a lot of concepts.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.880]   I think I've learned a lot today,
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.080]   and I hope all the Bogleheads have also.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.080]   - My pleasure.
