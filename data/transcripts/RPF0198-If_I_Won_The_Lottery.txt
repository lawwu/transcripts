[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:54.000]   On today's show, what would Joshua Sheets do if he won the lottery?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.560]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets. This is episode
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.560]   198. I'm your host. Thank you for being here. On today's show, I'm going to share with you
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.880]   my thoughts on winning the lottery. Hopefully, it'll inspire you to think about your own
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.420]   thoughts. I think this is a useful thought experiment. And the fun thing about being
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:27.580]   a podcast host is you get to hear my thought experiment. The inspiration for today's show
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.660]   comes from a listener named Micah, who sent me this email. He said, "So here's some fun
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.460]   questions for you." He says, "So this is a fun question that everyone loves to fantasize
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.440]   about. I hope it'll be fun for you to answer, but it could have a really boring answer,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.100]   but I'm sure you'll surprise me somehow. Question, what would you do if you won the lottery?
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.100]   And then part B, as a financial planner, what advice would you give to a client who had
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.340]   won the lottery? What would be the most optimal tax strategy? Would you take the payments
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.860]   or the lump sum? Would the upfront tax hit be worth it for the long-term capital gains,
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.720]   et cetera?" So, Micah, it's a fun question, and I'm going to answer it in the same spirit
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.300]   that it was asked, in a fun way. But I'm also going to use it just to share about some
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.260]   things that I believe are important. As I thought through and prepared my notes in preparation
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.220]   for this show, it brought out some very important ideas that I think will benefit you at least
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.460]   to think about, which is why I'm sharing it, and I'll be doing it in detail. But I want
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.180]   to start with just an observation that, as far as I'm concerned, I've already won the
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.580]   lottery. And I think probably so have you. I've already won the lottery of life. If you
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:50.660]   think about how incredibly privileged we all are in so many ways, for me, number one, just
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.300]   to be born at the time that I was born. I was born in 1985. Just think of the incredible
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.820]   change that we're living through. Think about the time that, for example, just this business
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.620]   pursuit, which I'll talk about later in the show more, but just radical personal finance.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.660]   It wasn't possible 30 years ago. And think about here I am hitting my stride as a young
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.820]   adult, and here I am able to use an incredible opportunity like this to communicate with
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.420]   so many people and hopefully be a source of encouragement to you, and you are to me. I
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.240]   won the lottery. I was born in the United States of America, probably the most prosperous
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.420]   nation in the history of the world. Opportunity is on every street corner and basically every
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.780]   side. I was born and raised in one of the most prosperous states in the country and
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.060]   one of the most beautiful areas. I live in a resort town that many people want to retire
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.980]   to and save for years to save their money and move to. I've been blessed with a lot
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.780]   of mental ability. I've been blessed with physical health. I'm able to learn quickly
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.220]   and easily. I don't struggle with academics. That makes my life much easier than many people.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.320]   I don't really have any significant learning disabilities. I think I have a tiny bit of
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.180]   dyslexia, but it really is not the kind of thing that's even worth mentioning. So I'm
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.020]   able to tackle new things. I have health. I have energy. I was raised in probably one
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.540]   of the most amazing family environments that I can think of where I have two parents who
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.140]   are together and have been married for what, 50 years, 40 years, something like that. I
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.960]   was raised in a stable household. I have a bunch of brothers and sisters, which gives
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.740]   me an incredible opportunity. I was the youngest of seven kids, which opens up an incredible
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.700]   opportunity to learn. You can watch all of your brothers and sisters make all the mistakes.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.820]   It's just one of the things I did as a kid is I told my parents, I said, "I'll just
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.180]   watch them do it, and I just won't make their same mistakes." So I've been incredibly
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:11.820]   blessed. I think probably just about all of you listening are the same way.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:20.900]   Now, you might not have the list that I have, but you'll have your own list. And I wanted
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.220]   to start there because I believe it's a good way to frame this discussion. I'm going
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.260]   to answer this question in detail and in the spirit of fun of thinking, what would I actually
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.540]   do if I won the lottery? But the problem is if I think about it as a hypothetical situation,
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.060]   that I'm unlikely to actually do something with it. But I think I've already won the
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.580]   lottery, and so have you. And so what do we do with that? In today's show, I'm going
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.600]   to talk a lot about the responsibility that winning a lottery or something similar would
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.300]   bring to my life and to your life. But I'm going to emphasize the responsibility that
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:14.380]   we already have to do something with the things that we've been privileged and blessed to
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.500]   have.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.780]   So with that framing up front, let's dig in. Quick note, today's show is going to
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:30.460]   be very personal to me, and it'll draw in some opinions that I hold and discussion of
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.100]   my own personal worldview, my own personal ideology. Anytime you don't want to hear
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.100]   what I think, there's a little button on your MP3 player that has two little arrows
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.180]   that point to the right. That's a fast-forward button. You can push it anytime you want.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.580]   But the challenge of this question is it's specifically asking what I would do if I won
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:59.100]   the lottery. And so if you're talking about how I would spend money, that's necessarily
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:07.220]   going to expose all of my values. If I were to look at how you spend money, if I were
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.380]   to come into your life and pull open a list of all of the financial transactions of your
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.140]   life over the last year, if every single one were carefully recorded with enough detail
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:23.100]   that I could know what the transaction was, I wouldn't actually need to meet you to
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:31.660]   be able to form a probably pretty accurate concept of who you are. Because the way that
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.580]   we spend money will be a reflection of who we are as a person. Every transaction tells
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.780]   a story. So I know that some of you are annoyed when I talk about things like worldviews,
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.820]   and I get that. But in the way that I'm creating this show, I aspire to do a couple
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:55.620]   of things. Anytime I think something is neutral, morally neutral or ideologically neutral or
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.100]   politically neutral, I try to present it in a way that demonstrates that. But if something
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.980]   isn't neutral, then I try to fairly present multiple sides of the issue. And I'm certainly
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.900]   imperfect at actually doing it, but I do my best to present content in a way that it is
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.340]   fair, the best that I'm able to do.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.940]   But the problem is that on many questions of money, there is no moral neutrality. Let's
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.260]   take a simple example from the political sphere. If we look at where a government spends the
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:29.780]   taxpayer's money, then we can get a clear idea of the moral constraints or moral objectives
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:37.140]   of that particular system of government. Some governments focus on building up their military
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:44.760]   strength. Some governments focus on building schools. Some give a certain amount of money
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.020]   to foreign aid. Some give a lot more money to foreign aid. Some governments focus on
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:57.340]   socialized systems of support for their citizens. All of these expenditures and budget items
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:05.740]   are driven by a system of morality. It's inescapable, and it's the same in all of our lives. Most
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:10.900]   of the dollars that we spend are going to be driven by our own system of values. And
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:17.740]   when you do a proper job with financial planning, you will fully integrate all of your values
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.900]   with all of your individual transaction decisions. We're whole people. We're not disconnected
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.300]   people.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.260]   So I'm not going to lecture on a single thing to you today. Rather, I'm just going to simply
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.480]   share my thoughts on what I would do. And I'm not lecturing you on it, but I will do
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.420]   my best to kind of share with you why I think the way that I do. And I'm going to do so
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.740]   in answering three questions, three major sections. I'm going to give you my thoughts
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.020]   on lotteries and why I actually hate them the way that they're currently structured.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.260]   Then what would I buy or what would I do if I won the lottery, and how would I actually
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.100]   invest the money?
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.580]   So the first part is going to be, again, specific to lotteries. I'm going to spend a little
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.340]   bit of time just simply sharing with you some of the underpinnings of my worldview and my
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:07.420]   personal experience, because money touches at the core of my entire understanding of
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.460]   life and it's been a major influence in my life. You don't get to the point where you
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.780]   work as a financial advisor and do a show talking about money every day if it's not
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.860]   something that's important to you.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.100]   And then I'll go into some very specific discussion of what I would buy and how I would
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.100]   invest.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.740]   But let's start with lotteries. I think this is a great question to think about. Super
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.740]   fun. And I've done this mental exercise many times and I had a lot of fun doing it again,
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.860]   just even in considering Micah's question.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.900]   Just for fun, I put a $10 million number on the windfall to be able to answer. Obviously,
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:48.020]   winning a lottery could be winning $1,000 in some scratch-off game or it could be $200
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:57.500]   million in a lotto grand prize Powerball payout. I didn't choose those numbers because $1,000
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:04.220]   would be relatively non-impactful to my financial life. I mean, I'll cash the check if you
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.500]   send it to me but it's not going to substantially affect my goals or probably even yours.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.480]   But on the other hand, $200 million would be utterly overwhelming to me to think about.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.940]   It would completely shut down as the computer when you throw too much stuff at a computer
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.260]   system and it shuts down. It would be utterly overwhelming. I cannot even conceive of what
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:32.600]   I would do in that situation except sit down and cry at the enormous burden and responsibility
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.900]   of all that money.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.740]   I'm not at the place in my own personal experience where I can even – other than
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.580]   in an intellectual sense on some technical financial planning topic where I don't have
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.580]   to deal with the emotion of it. I can't conceive of those numbers. But I think I can
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:55.820]   handle $10 million as far as a mindset. My experience in my own personal life makes that
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:01.340]   a number that I could actually feel and understand.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:06.020]   So I've pegged this at $10 million. To make it easier on myself, I actually have mentally
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:11.760]   changed it from winning a lottery to having a rich aunt or uncle die unexpectedly and
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.020]   leave me the money. Lotteries cause me personal problems and it's not just because of the
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:23.140]   math involved of the very low likelihood of winning the jackpot. But it's primarily
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.100]   because of the element of chance and the way that the system is structured at least in
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.100]   the United States of America.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.220]   I think I've actually bought at least two lottery tickets in my lifetime, maybe three
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.700]   or four. But I specifically remember two. One was when I was 18 or 19 years old and
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.860]   I had never played the lottery and I said, "This will be fun. I'm trying to rebel
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.820]   against what I've been taught." And so I went and bought some scratch off tickets
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.380]   and I scratched them off anxiously in the parking lot and felt like a total idiot because
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.800]   I'd wasted my money and I didn't win a thing.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.200]   Another time I remember specifically I was out with some family members who were visiting
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.120]   from out of town to dinner and the jackpot was over $200 million. So they swung by Publix
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.000]   to grab some tickets just for fun. I bet many of you would do the same thing just for fun.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.120]   You're not a habitual player but when the numbers get massive, you grab a ticket or
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.920]   two. So I tossed in my $3 and got a ticket. Then I felt like a total idiot when I went
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.800]   and checked the numbers and didn't win. I don't like wasting money.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.560]   But on the flip side, I've actually made a lot of money on the lottery because the
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:24.640]   Florida lottery gave me a lot of money toward my college tuition through the Bright Future
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.600]   Scholarship is what it's called in our state. So I've come out way ahead. They have a
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.480]   system in the Florida lottery where if you have sufficient academic standing, you can
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:43.000]   have 100% of your tuition to a state-run school paid for specifically and I had that highest
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.440]   level. Now I went to a private school with a much higher tuition so it didn't cover
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.920]   100% of my tuition but it was the equivalent of the state system.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.540]   The problem is I'm absolutely opposed to lotteries the way that they're currently
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:03.800]   structured because of the political maneuvering. I have a series of arguments lined up that
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.560]   I'm going to share with you and you feel free to disagree with any of these arguments.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.280]   They don't build on each other. They're all separate distinct arguments.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.720]   But the first one is I don't like the government monopoly on lotteries that we have in the
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.120]   United States of America. I'm going to read to you a couple of articles on – some excerpts
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   from some articles on the history of lotteries. But it's a fascinating history when you
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.760]   actually get into it, at least in the United States. The history of gambling in general
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.720]   is long and interesting but the history of lotteries specific is very interesting.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:44.360]   There's a very long thread of tension between the need for certain people to raise money
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:51.800]   which is what lotteries are effective at and the moral opposition to them. This tension
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.720]   has been around for a very long time. They've gone in and out of favor over the centuries.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.080]   In the beginning of the United States, at least the founding of the nation, lotteries
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:06.240]   were quite popular. Over time during the 1800s, there was a substantial uprising of social
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.120]   religious pressure that ultimately led to the outlaw of the lotteries.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.400]   Reading from an article on the Priceonomics blog going over – which goes over the history
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:22.480]   of this, "In 1878, Louisiana ran the only legal lottery in the US. In the 1890s, national
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.560]   legislation prevented lotteries that crossed state borders and 35 states constitutionally
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:34.240]   banned lotteries. Legal lotteries took place only intermittently, although illegal ones
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.000]   still enjoyed popularity, until the Great Depression and World War II when the need
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.040]   for cash and stimulus overcame the reduced opposition to gambling and lotteries. In 1964,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.440]   a referendum by New Hampshire voters legalized the lottery to close a state budget gap and
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:56.000]   to fund the school system. A majority of states eventually followed New Hampshire's example.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.800]   It's a testament to the endurance of the opposition to gambling that no privately run
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.400]   lotteries exist."
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:09.640]   Now, the major problem with the system of lotteries is that in order to get past the
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:16.560]   overall social opposition to gambling, there needs to be some sweeter incentive, something
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.120]   to sweeten up the pot. So there needs to be something positive associated with it to make
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:30.920]   up for the moral evil and the negative impact on society that comes with gambling. "Politicians,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.360]   voters and other actors have legitimized lotteries by linking them to activities of apple pie
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.200]   wholesomeness, funding education budgets, building libraries. One law during the Depression
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.800]   selectively allowed bingo at churches as donations to churches dried up."
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:54.020]   So you might ask the question, why is the state involved at all in a system of lotteries?
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.280]   And here I'm going to read an excerpt from an article from the Daily Beast by a professor
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.920]   of law at Yale University named Stephen Carter. "I'm not at the moment challenging the
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.400]   morality of gambling generally. Rather, I am fascinated by how different lotteries are
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   from other functions that we generally agree the state should undertake. So for example,
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.420]   the state must famously provide for the common defense and protect the common environment.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.360]   Because if those services were provided privately, there would be no way to keep those who did
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:31.240]   not pay their share from reaping the benefits. A government might provide a charitable service,
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.680]   food stamps for example, as a way of guaranteeing everyone a particular level of life's necessities.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.180]   In other fields such as health insurance, those who believe that the government should
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.480]   provide it believe that the state will do a better job than private insurers. And whether
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.320]   they are right or wrong, they are at least offering an argument for not leaving the matter
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.920]   to the market. But with lotteries, as with other forms of gambling, no such argument
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.160]   exists. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the state can provide gambling services
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.360]   better than the private sector does. This is not a situation in which the government
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.400]   will return more value to consumers than the private market will, a claim often made for
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:15.140]   example by critics of for-profit health insurers. As a matter of fact, state-run lotteries return
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:21.120]   around 50% of revenues to winners. In other words, the expected value from a $1 bet is
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.280]   50 cents. No casino could stay in business offering odds this poor, but the government
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:33.800]   manages it by prohibiting competition. Indeed, as William Norman Thompson points out in his
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:39.000]   History of Gambling, in the states where other forms of gambling are legal, the bettor's
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.280]   expected return is significantly higher than in the lottery, even when you factor taxes
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.520]   on the winnings. Most states do not tax winnings from their own lotteries. The federal government,
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.080]   of course, taxes it all. Overall, privately run gambling operations return something like
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.920]   80% of bets in winning. In other words, from the point of view of the consumer, a state-run
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.320]   lottery is far worse than a private operation. There is absolutely no reason to believe that
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.440]   the state can provide gambling services better than the private sector does. There are other
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.320]   fields one might argue that the state should exit because the private sector could handle
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.920]   them better. For example, in the wake of stories about air traffic controllers falling asleep
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.800]   on the job, an increasing number of critics have suggested that the federal government
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.840]   runs the system quite badly, especially in comparison with the private companies that
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.640]   police the skies in so much of the West, notably Canada. But gambling is different. At least
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.640]   in the case of air traffic control, there are historical reasons to explain why we still
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.920]   have the cumbersome official bureaucracy in charge. In the case of gambling, the reason
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:50.160]   is a policy choice, and a simple one, raising revenue. Make no mistake, the state is here
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.760]   using its monopoly power to control businesses that others would happily provide. The success
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.000]   of Las Vegas and of the very online poker sites the government is busily shutting down
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.040]   are the evidence. Most states prohibit the running of any "game of chance" for profit.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.840]   These restrictions flowed originally from a concern about moral degeneracy, the fear
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.480]   that gambling could easily become all-consuming and destructive. Another concern was that
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.360]   con artists would find ways to fleece the unsuspecting by concealing the true odds of
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.520]   winning. Evidently, those concerns are unimportant once the profits begin flowing into government
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:30.880]   coffers. And make no mistake, profit is what the state is after. In his textbook Public
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.020]   Finance, a Contemporary Application of Theory to Policy, economist David N. Hyman puts it
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.880]   this way, "Lotteries are profit-making enterprises that most states run like any
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:47.240]   business, with heavy advertising and innovation in products that generate sales." The earliest
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.000]   American efforts at raising funds through lotteries failed largely because the public
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.680]   stayed away, often out of a sense of repugnance. The states that run lotteries today have learned
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:02.520]   the lesson, wearing away moral objections through a combination of heavy advertising
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.320]   and the trumpeting of huge jackpots by the complacent media. And if we really no longer
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.520]   believe that games of chance are immoral, there is no reason not to let the private
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.080]   sector run them, at better odds for the better. Now, it is true that we live in an era when
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   the states need revenue desperately, but are lotteries really the best way to raise them?
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.020]   The regressive effects of the lottery has been documented so often that the argument
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.600]   has become ubiquitous, simply part of the background. Poor consumers spend a far higher
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.600]   proportion of their income on lottery tickets than wealthy consumers do. In other words,
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.640]   the states are raising revenue by tempting the worst off of their citizens to hand over
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.240]   their scarce dollars, playing a game with a ridiculously low return.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:52.400]   That's the end of Carter's essay. Now, I'm not exactly sure of my own opinion on
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:59.120]   whether or not lotteries should be freely permitted to exist. I think one of two things.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.520]   Either lotteries should be freely permitted to exist on a private basis, free and open
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.880]   to competition by anyone who wants to get involved, or they should be banned entirely,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:19.280]   for everybody, based upon the moral objection and the impact on society. In general, I'm
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:26.720]   mostly inclined to the first opinion, to let them exist regardless. This is due to my strong
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.860]   libertarian bent, which is simply live and let live. You make up your own decisions.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:38.140]   But I've been reconsidering my positions for the last six months to a year on the topic
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.840]   of legislating moral behavior and trying to figure out what makes sense because the reality
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:49.520]   is we do in fact legislate morality across the board. The majority of arguments regarding
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.920]   legislation are based on moral grounds, but the question is whose moral grounds and why?
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:01.720]   So I've been doing my best to, in my spare time, kind of systematically rethink my perceptions
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.320]   on that issue for quite a while. I'm not sure where I stand at this point. I have an
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.360]   unsettled feeling at the moment. Again, I've been thinking a lot about it, searching for
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.800]   the right perspective, and I'm not sure exactly what to conclude.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.120]   But regardless, I don't think we should be running the system the way that we currently
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:26.680]   run it. Again, I could probably be argued in both of those directions. But to say that
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:34.120]   something is morally evil and its impact is negative on society and thus we're going
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:40.560]   to restrict it for everybody except the state to run and then in order for the state to
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.480]   run it effectively, we're going to sweeten the market by figuring out what are some good
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:50.600]   wholesome things to send the money to that are politically popular, that's not a good
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.840]   plan. I don't think that politicians should be
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.680]   buying their access to the market through a state-run monopoly and then just simply
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.160]   sending the money to education. That's how it works in my state and in most of the 50
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.380]   United States. Basically, we know that lotteries lead to moral decline and generally oppress
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.760]   the poor. So in order to make them palatable to the general public, we take some money
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:18.520]   out and send it to education. So here's the impact and here's my summary
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.680]   of how it winds up working in the long run. Again, feel free to disagree with me and form
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.020]   your own opinion. It's just mine. But lotteries are actually about the worst of the worst
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:32.240]   of the worst in terms of things that are wrong in our current society. Overwhelmingly, it's
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.780]   poor people who play lotteries at the highest levels. So lotteries effectively wind up being
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:45.780]   a tax on poor people. That tax is contrary to what is stated as being our overall policy
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:53.080]   of taxation in the United States. Supposedly, we believe as a nation in the concept of progressive
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:59.240]   taxation that the rich should pay more, a higher percentage of their income, than the
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:06.840]   poor. This tax is the opposite. It's regressive and the poor pay way more as a percentage
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:12.280]   of their income than the rich. Now, I'm not in favor of progressive or regressive
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.480]   taxation. I'm in favor of flat taxation. But I'm just pointing out this is the actual
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.000]   effect of the lottery. So we know this about lotteries and we feel pretty scummy about
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.100]   them. So we try to offset those feelings of guilt with a slick sales job using the topic
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:30.360]   of funding education. Most states have applied some or all of their profits from running
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.480]   a lottery to the state's educational programs in order to get it past the voters and in
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.360]   order to gain popular support. Basically, we say, "Well, we don't really like the
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.120]   lotteries. But as long as we can benefit society by funding education instead of just enriching
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.720]   the corporation in charge, we'll take it." And in theory, public schools and the concept
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.920]   of public education is sold as benefiting society with a special emphasis on benefiting
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:59.840]   the poor. Theoretically, it's a social public good. This fits into our US-American ethos
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.400]   of egalitarianism and equal access for all. After all, we know, well, the rich would send
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.680]   their kids to school but the poor would--they would all be uneducated misfits. So we're
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.300]   going to apply equal education for all. So we say that, "Well, we'll offset the oppression
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.640]   of the poor by offering funding for public schools and scholarships for college," and
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.000]   that's the sales pitch. So what's the problem? Well, number one, in my opinion, the primary
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.260]   function of public schooling in the United States is not the education and equipping
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:32.000]   of the individual person but rather the homogenization of society for easier governing and control
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.720]   and the babysitting of kids so that both parents can be involved in the labor force, thus keeping
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.880]   per capita labor costs low. Feel free to disagree with that. That's one of the less popular
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:47.680]   opinions that I have. So feel free to disagree but at least research the question a little
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.120]   bit and see if you can find any evidence in favor of that thesis. I find the historical
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.560]   evidence compelling and as I watch society at large, I find the current evidence compelling.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.920]   But you have to judge for yourself. But that press to keep per capita labor costs low results
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:11.640]   in real damage to the poor. It really does. Now, ignore that argument because that one,
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.520]   again, is one of my wilder ones. Even if the purpose of school is all about the education
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.800]   and equipping of the individual, at least consider this, the results of academic achievement
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.960]   in literacy and numeracy in the United States are quite bad compared to what they could
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.000]   be. Many people seem to agree on that and different people suggest different solutions
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.320]   to that problem. Most of the solutions involve spending more money. The problem for me is
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.480]   I've never found any compelling evidence that spending more money solves the problem
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.580]   and improves the results. The only evidence I've seen of what makes the difference seems
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:54.000]   to be primarily parental involvement and maybe the impact of PE classes and physical movement
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.120]   during school. Now, if you have evidence in favor of anything else, I'd love to see it.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.800]   I've never found it. Some of the most expensive public school districts in the country have
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.960]   the worst performance as measured by test scores. When you compare the fact that the
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.200]   average public school district in the United States of America spends $10,000 per year
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:20.560]   per child, that's the average, almost double that in some states, and gets, depending on
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:26.240]   the district, academic results that are mediocre to bad, and the average homeschool family
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.000]   spends $500 per year per student, and these students outperform the public school kids
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.800]   on every academic metric I've ever read about, we know the primary problem isn't lack of
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:43.720]   money. Now, that disparity in cost doesn't include the cost of the parent's time in
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.080]   home education in the $500 number, but it does include the cost of the teacher's time
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:54.760]   in the $10,000 number. So that is a flaw in that argument. But in 2015, in a world where
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.280]   once we get a child past those first few years of handholding to the point where they can
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:04.800]   use a computer effectively, then we can have essentially one world-class teacher teach
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:10.640]   a subject to millions of kids through a virtual connection. We can certainly at least improve
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:16.520]   the system a little bit, even if we had to redesign the system of teachers. At least,
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:21.640]   if nothing else, find out who the best math teacher is in the United States, give them
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.560]   an internet connection – it's already been done, it's free, it's called the Khan Academy
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:31.200]   – give them an internet connection, let them teach one lesson, and then take half
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.680]   the teachers and double the – turn them all into tutors so they have time just to
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.320]   tutor kids instead of teaching kids. Anyway, that's tough. But my point is more money
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.500]   simply does not equal a better education.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:51.400]   So why doesn't – why don't simple changes get done? Well, politics and votes. Until
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.280]   the change is forced by the free market conditions, it's not going to get changed. Now, that
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.840]   change is coming. It's been building and building and building, and it's going to
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.320]   change massively in the next decade or two. Remember, in any compounding curve, at the
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.960]   beginning, the compounding effect that is measured and felt is tiny, and it's massive
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.520]   as it grows.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.920]   Now the other problem with this line of thinking is remember that the academic metrics are
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:25.240]   actually horrible predictors of life success in almost every single way. They simply do
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.080]   not translate to real world results in any measurable way that I've ever been able
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:37.760]   to find evidence for. GPAs and test scores primarily predict the students who do well
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.920]   in the formal academic structure. Students with great GPAs and great test scores in high
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:48.240]   school are likely to do well in college, and those who have great GPAs and great test scores
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.800]   in college, undergraduate college, are likely to do well in graduate school. But once you
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:59.440]   get out of the academic environment, you don't find a reliable causal relationship between
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:06.040]   GPAs and test scores and financial income or life success. Test scores essentially predict
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   excellent students. They don't necessarily predict successful people or even rich people.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:19.080]   So even if we pour loads of money in, that doesn't necessarily impact the lifelong
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.120]   success of the student.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:28.640]   Now next argument. Assume all of what I just said is wrong. Even if the purpose of public
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.200]   schools is the education and equipping of the student individually, and even if the
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:39.480]   current structure is the best way to achieve that purpose. The problem is the people who
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:45.960]   are most ill served by the current structure and the current system are the poor, and the
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.440]   people who are the most benefited by the current system are the mass affluent. And research
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:56.080]   the numbers here. The high school dropout rates for poor students are extremely high.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.960]   The poorest 20% of students as measured by household income are five times more likely
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:10.200]   than the richest 20% of students to drop out of high school. Why? Well, usually there are
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:16.840]   three major reasons that are cited that are the primary contributing factors as to why
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.000]   students drop out of high school.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.280]   Number one, lack of parent engagement. Number two, poor academic performance of the student.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:37.080]   And number three, the family income needs. Now all of these statistics can be beat. It's
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:42.960]   been proven again and again that on an individual basis, they can be changed. When a teacher
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   takes an interest in a child and really encourages them and inspires them and holds them accountable,
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:57.680]   those factors and those trends can be beat. But in general, students from poor families
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:03.800]   get worse results from the government school system than students of the mass affluent.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.520]   Now who gets the benefits? What do many wise affluent parents do? Well, they carefully
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.880]   research school districts and they take advantage of the subsidized cost of schooling for their
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:21.120]   family's own economic benefit. Read Tom Stanley's research on the habits and practice of millionaires
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:27.820]   and you find this as a consistent theme throughout. Millionaires often search carefully and choose
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.720]   their homes carefully to be in an excellent school district so they don't have to pay
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:38.960]   for private school tuition. Now many affluent families still pay for private school tuition.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.760]   If you're working in the glittering rich, you're very likely to be sending your child
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.000]   through the elite system of boarding schools or something like that. There's a big difference
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.320]   there, but I'm talking about the mass affluent. So what's the impact on students? Well, richer
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:04.280]   families are more likely to have engaged parents. Makes a big difference in their child's encouragement
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:09.700]   to finish schooling. Richer families are more likely to hold their students accountable
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:15.460]   for their academic performance. So the student has an incentive to increase their academic
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:21.840]   performance because among the rich, education is one of the most highly valued, one of the
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:30.560]   highest values. And richer families are less likely to have problems with their family
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.360]   income. Their family income needs are satisfied. So the students can afford to make the time
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:47.960]   to study and can afford to be focused exclusively or primarily on their academic achievement.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:54.200]   So what we have is a system where the poor are playing the lottery, paying for the funding
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:02.400]   of schools and not benefiting from it on the back end. Now everything I just said is about
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.240]   primary and secondary schooling, but depending on the state's lottery system, some of that
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:14.400]   money goes into college education as well. And many of those things apply to college
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.500]   as well. Poor students are less likely to go to college and less likely to graduate
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.360]   from college and thus they're less likely to benefit from the lottery college education
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.960]   funding than are rich students. I got a lot of money from the Bright Futures program in
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.320]   my state, which is a lottery program. As I recall, probably something in total of $15,000
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:42.960]   to $20,000 over the four years of college tuition. That direct subsidy went into my
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:53.080]   pocket. Now my parents didn't contribute financially to my college education, so I
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.420]   was a pretty poor student all the way through. But I didn't necessarily qualify as a poor
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.160]   student the way that these things are measured. The problem is that college subsidy is in
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.480]   addition to all of the other money we spend on public colleges and universities, much
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:13.560]   of which is very bloated and wasted. And if it's not bloated and wasted, it's certainly
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.480]   at least out of date, where in, again, 2015, one professor can teach millions of people
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.320]   efficiently and many professors then could go on and provide the individual interaction
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.740]   in other ways.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:33.480]   Now, one more very quick libertarian argument and then an argument that you'll agree with
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:38.700]   me regardless of your – probably regardless of your political background on the far spectrum
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.480]   from where I am. But the quick libertarian argument is this. Even if the purpose of public
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.320]   schools is the education and equipping of the student and even if the current structure
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:53.220]   is the best way to achieve that purpose and even if all students from all economic backgrounds
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:57.600]   were well-served by the school system, I think it's still a problem because it's a system
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:05.640]   that relies on theft to fund it. My children and their education is my responsibility,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.500]   not yours.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:13.080]   So basically what happens is we live in a system where I send the police to my neighbor's
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.000]   door who don't – they don't have any kids and the police stand there with a gun
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.200]   on their hip to enforce the tax that's extracted from my neighbor to pay for my kid's schooling.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.840]   So I'm forcing my neighbor who doesn't have children to pay for their kid's schooling.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.120]   As far as I'm concerned, that's theft. Now, why doesn't it change? Well, we've
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.820]   decided as a society collectively, theoretically, that it's a social good and my neighbor
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:44.200]   is benefited by my children not being total misfits and we think that's the best system
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   that we have.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   But taking money from the poor with a lottery system and putting it into a system that's
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:56.920]   based upon theft is not a good system in my opinion. Theft from the rich is just as evil
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:04.480]   as theft from the poor regardless of what Robin Hood had to say about it. Now, the argument
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.400]   that – feel free to disagree with that one. That one is a very unusual and unpopular opinion
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.120]   in our modern society. But here is one that I think you will likely agree with.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.240]   So let me disagree with every one of my other arguments and you're very much in favor
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:29.840]   of promoting and sponsoring state-funded schooling. Well, what's the problem with the lottery?
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   Costs are rising for many reasons, some structural, some non-structural. The government school
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:47.960]   system is a total disaster because the embedded structural costs are long-ranging and massive.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:58.080]   But popular support goes down. People have a desire to see on a social basis education
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.720]   raised which is why the majority of politicians will say, "We've got to fund education.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.440]   We've got to fund education." It's the last – it's the only state religion that
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.600]   we have in the United States of America is the concept of education. It's almost sacrosanct.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:20.640]   It can't be touched. But the problem is the embedded costs continue to rise. Even
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:26.520]   though people give – and general – lip service to the idea, we all pretty much feel
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:32.400]   like we're being about taxed enough. So in an era of rising costs, the money has to
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:40.600]   come from somewhere. Because the politicians are loath to raise taxes in some states, what's
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   happening is some states are steadily taking the lottery funds and replacing existing tax-based
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:55.920]   funds for education with those lottery funds. So instead of lottery money being additional
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:02.680]   funding, it's replacement funding. The money is not extra money. It's replacement money.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:11.920]   That's a real problem. What happens is instead of coming together as a society collectively,
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   forming the structure of a state and saying officially, "We officially want to have
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:24.040]   common schooling for all of our citizens so that the society in general is enhanced and
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.000]   we are all willing to pay for it, even those of us who don't have kids and who don't
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.320]   realize the direct benefit from this, and then we officially follow through to pay for
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:44.160]   it to realize our gains," what we actually do is we take the money from poor people with
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:52.120]   an indirect tax and replace the other directly taxed money with the indirectly taxed money
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:59.520]   so that we can spend the other directly taxed money on other stuff. It's a bait and switch.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:08.400]   Which benefits who? The politicians in charge. It's a corrupt system. It's a corrupt system
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:16.160]   that is pervasive across our society. We promise benefits now without actually paying for them
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:21.320]   so that we can get the political popularity of the benefits while avoiding the political
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.400]   unpopularity of having to pay for them. We can argue about what we should or should not
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:33.200]   collectively do as a society, but if we argue and decide among ourselves collectively that
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:43.080]   we're going to provide a certain benefit, it's only right that it be paid for. For
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:50.000]   all those reasons, I have major issues with lotteries and the focus on education. I hope
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.160]   you'll think through some of those discussions and consider your own perspective. There's
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:02.120]   no broad-ranging political upswell of support to make any changes for lotteries, and I don't
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:07.720]   really expect there to be. This is a very quiet issue, which I never hear anybody talk
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:15.280]   about, but this is what's happening quietly in the background. So just consider it.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:21.160]   Now my final argument on lotteries is very brief, but it's also very important. Ignore
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.660]   all the arguments related to education and just focus on this one. Winning the lottery
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:34.080]   is for the most part very bad for many winners. It has major ill effects in many of their
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:39.520]   lives and it's often a curse. Now it's not always. We love the stories of the people
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:45.600]   who are benefited from it, and many people are able to take the money and put it to excellent
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:53.520]   use. But in many people, it's a curse. I tried to research the statistics on this question,
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.960]   but they were too inconclusive officially for me to be comfortable citing any of them.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.940]   There's a lot of misinformation on the topic. But it seems to me that at least more often
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.760]   than not, so I guess that would put it at a higher than 50% number, but I'll just say
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:16.200]   more often than not because I don't know the exact number. The effect on the lottery winner's
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:23.720]   life is negative because more often than not, the buyers of lottery tickets are poor and
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:30.840]   undisciplined with money already. Now again, many people play the lottery who are not poor,
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.300]   maybe even some of you who are listening. For some people, it's fun and it's not a
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.820]   substantial part of their income, and thus it has few ill effects. But a disproportionately
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:46.000]   high number of people who are poor play consistently. And here I'll cite a quote from a Wired
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.180]   article. "While approximately half of Americans buy at least one lottery ticket at some point,
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:59.420]   the vast majority of tickets are purchased by about 20% of the population." I'm interrupting
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:04.780]   the quote. That's about what you would expect, Pareto principle at work. These high frequency
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:10.060]   players tend to be poor and uneducated, which is why critics refer to lotteries as a regressive
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:17.000]   tax. In a 2006 survey, 30% of people without a high school degree said that playing the
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.500]   lottery was a wealth building strategy. On average, households that make less than $12,400
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:35.780]   a year spend 5% of their income on lotteries, a source of hope for just a few bucks a throw.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:44.300]   Think about that number. On average, households that make less than $12,400 a year spend 5%
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:52.180]   of their income on lotteries. Now, if you make less than $12,000, if you make $12,400
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:45:02.620]   a year and you spend 5% of your income on a lottery, that comes out to be $620 per year.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:12.580]   If you are making that tiny amount of money per year, $620 is a huge amount of money for
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:20.340]   you to be wasting. If you've listened to this show for any length of time, you should start
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:27.500]   to recognize that you have to behave very differently depending on where you are in
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:36.660]   your financial journey. The person earning $12,400 a year must take advantage of every
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:45.040]   single dollar and squeeze every bit of value out of it. And $620 per year is the price
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:52.740]   that you need to be investing into furthering your education, into investing in your own
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:46:00.980]   business, into any number of things that are better than a lottery. If you're making $100,000
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.980]   a year and just for fun when you're filling up your car with gas, you buy a couple of
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:10.380]   lottery tickets, it doesn't really matter. But that's not what happens. And that is a
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:19.820]   horrifyingly high number of dollars to be spending on an absolute waste, $620 per year.
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:30.200]   That's $51.67 per month in a budget with zero wiggle room.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:36.140]   So when somebody's making decisions that poor and then they come into a lot of money all
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:43.220]   of a sudden, it quickly destroys their lives. And you have incredibly high incidence of
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:53.140]   divorce, depression, suicide, bankruptcy, etc. If people who already have a framework
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.020]   for wealth come into sudden money, then it just simply flows into their lives without
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:04.740]   a major disruption. It goes to the next goal on the list. And so therefore, again, some
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.700]   people do win the lottery who are already effective with money just because they play
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:13.620]   for fun. It's something that they enjoy in the same way that you might go on a cruise
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:18.900]   and decide to blow a thousand bucks on the blackjack tables. I wouldn't do it but it
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:24.660]   doesn't necessarily mean that you are I think financially responsible. I've blown my $50
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.660]   a couple of times on a blackjack table.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:36.180]   The point is the scale matters. Just consider those things in your normal life. And again,
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:41.500]   I don't have any action steps with it but I do think those are at least compelling reasons.
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:47.660]   For all those reasons, I'm choosing to answer this question from the perspective of an unexpected
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.900]   rich relative dying and leaving me an unexpected inheritance rather than based on a lottery
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:57.700]   winning. Since I don't play the lottery, it's a little bit easier for me to consider that
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.500]   actually happening. So what would I actually do? What would I buy? What would I do with
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.700]   the money? How would I invest it?
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:11.460]   Well, again, we're going to be talking about something that's based upon values. It's a
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:17.740]   very personal question. In order for you to understand my answer to the question, you
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.180]   would need to understand a little bit about the framework of my worldview and especially
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:28.500]   a little bit of my personal history as it relates to money. And I'm going to share with
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:35.420]   you four important concepts behind my personal worldview and how I think about handling money
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:40.940]   that flows into my life. And those four concepts are number one, accountability. Am I accountable
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:46.120]   for how I spend money and if so, to whom? Number two, sovereignty. Who's in charge of
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:52.380]   how I spend my money? Number three, a concept of stewardship. And number four, a concept
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:59.340]   of faithfulness. And those last two are two concepts that are primarily specific to Christianity.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.580]   And if you've gotten with me to this point in the show, thank you. I'm going to spend
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:07.920]   a little bit of time talking about Christianity and biblical teaching on money. If you're
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.580]   accustomed to tuning out religious discussions, feel free to skip it. I'll put a note in the
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.780]   show notes where I actually get to what I would invest in. But I will ask you to give
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:23.620]   this a shot, and especially if you are a secular person. And so as a bait for you, I'll give
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:30.820]   you a few tidbits in these next few ideas that you can use to catch out some of your
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:36.420]   Bible-thumping friends on some of their favorite Bible verses. And if you like to challenge
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:41.000]   people on their beliefs, as I do, and if you enjoy being challenged yourself, as I do,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.540]   you might enjoy this. I hold to a biblical Christian worldview. And I'll define that
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.860]   a little bit for you, because every worldview has nuances. It's just because you give something
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:58.660]   a name doesn't necessarily mean you actually know what it is. But the impact of my life
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:04.460]   of this worldview on money is hard to overstate. One of the major reasons that I didn't become
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:09.220]   a Christian at an earlier age is that I didn't want somebody else to tell me what to do with
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:17.020]   my money. Because I was raised in an environment of family filled with Christians and an environment
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:23.820]   filled with Christians, I knew that was a major component of Christianity. And I never
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.340]   wanted someone to tell me what to do with my money. I wanted to be rich. I wanted a
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:35.380]   fancy lifestyle. I hated the idea, what I associated with Christianity, of being sent
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:42.740]   off into lifelong poverty, never able to spend money, never able to have fun, just never
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:50.340]   being able to do that. But I often wondered if what Christians said was true was actually
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:58.060]   true. Did people really change? Now, my own path into a relationship with God was a bit
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:09.620]   different, I think, than many people. It started to some degree intellectually. I started from
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:15.660]   the philosophical perspective of thinking, "Is there a God?" And that's why you'll
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:20.540]   notice the flavor of when I talk about this stuff, it's driven philosophically. That
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.700]   was because that was a meaningful way for me. So for me, it started intellectually.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:32.540]   And then later I saw my own sinfulness. I didn't see the whole at the beginning. I
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:39.460]   only saw part of it. My major personal struggles with sin were sexual sin and pride. And I
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:44.260]   repented of those sins, but I didn't clearly see how much my love of money had affected
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:51.860]   my life or really even know how to repent of it at the beginning. And I was very grudging
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:58.020]   and very slow with regard to thinking about what to do with money. In other areas, I was
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:05.460]   much more willing to follow God's teachings, but not with money. I knew that if I were
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.820]   to become a Christian, this is what kept me away for so long, I was surrendering absolute
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.980]   control of my life. And that's a tough, tough decision to make, especially when you're
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:21.260]   young and capable and strong and self-sufficient, and especially when you love money. There's
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.980]   actually a Bible story about that. I won't go into that one. But I didn't know what
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:32.020]   to do with that. I knew that I had to surrender, so I very grudgingly surrendered, but it wasn't
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:38.380]   clear for me how to repent of that because it was pretty deep. Now, if I'd stolen money,
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.880]   it would have been simpler. Repentance would have meant confessing the sin and going back
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:46.860]   and making restitution to everyone from whom I'd stolen money. But how do you repent
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:53.580]   of a love of money? How do you make that right? I didn't really know what to do about it.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:57.700]   And so I just simply had to kind of set those topics aside for a little while. But one of
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.980]   the things that I discovered in the last 10 years of my own personal relationship since
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:06.960]   I was born again was a dramatic change in my heart. I discovered that what Christians
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:14.420]   said was true was true, and that God really could change people. I didn't make these changes
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:21.260]   intentionally. I couldn't. I didn't have any ability to control personally my love of money,
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:26.060]   but little by little, these things changed. So what I'm going to share with you is a very
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:36.660]   hard fought struggle and journey in my life to this position. That's simply a way of saying,
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.660]   feel free to disagree with me because I understand the disagreement because I would have hated
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:48.800]   hearing these ideas in the past. I did hate that. But things have changed. And I am still
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:54.240]   very imperfect with knowing exactly what to do and seeing all the ways that it learns
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.440]   and works out. I'm learning and I'm growing, but I'm sure there are areas of fault and
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.080]   failure and there might even be some hypocrisy in some area of my life. I don't see it right
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:06.900]   now, but I might be blind to it. And I'm quite certain that some of the things that I currently
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.960]   think and believe are probably wrong. I joke with my wife that 50% of what I currently
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.420]   believe is wrong. The problem is I don't know which 50% it is. So thus we have one of the
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.800]   major joys of life to sort through our thinking and study and learn and grow.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:25.460]   So one of the fundamental distinctions regarding life and money and different worldviews is
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:30.660]   the concept of accountability, accountability in general and accountability with regard
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:37.340]   to what we do with our money. If you won $10 million from a rich uncle or rich aunt, to
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:45.400]   whom are you accountable? Are you even accountable at all? Are you accountable to that uncle
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:58.260]   or aunt to use the money in a way that they would wish? If so, why? Or if not, why not?
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:04.060]   Are you accountable to society in general to use the money for some social purpose,
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:16.620]   social good? If so, why? If not, why not? Are you accountable to the state government
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:28.780]   to pay their share of tax on the money? If so, why? If not, why not? What if you inherited
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:33.060]   the money in secret? What if it's untraceable gold coins that are passed to you and handed
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:38.820]   to you? Are you still accountable to pay your share of the tax? Are you accountable to your
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:48.580]   spouse to share the money with them collectively? If so, why? And if not, why not? Are you accountable
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:56.620]   to your family to help your family members? Are you accountable to yourself? Are you accountable
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:05.780]   to God? Are we accountable for the things that we do, and if so, to whom? If you think
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.060]   about that question, you come up with many different answers. In the Christian worldview,
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:14.160]   you're accountable to God to use the money in the way that he would instruct. In a secular
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:21.020]   worldview, you're accountable primarily to yourself to make yourself happy. And secondarily,
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:26.340]   you might be accountable to society depending on which philosophical stream you are comfortable
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:31.180]   with. There's a vague secondary accountability to society in general.
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:38.340]   We all live within an environment of accountability, but we rarely consider the basis for it. So
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:43.700]   consider it. To whom are we accountable and why? To whom are you accountable in your job?
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:48.580]   To whom is the CEO of your company accountable to? To whom are the governing bodies accountable
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:54.860]   to? Where does our authority come from and why? I believe the answer to that question
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:57:01.860]   starts and flows out of Genesis 1, verses 1, which says, "In the beginning, God created
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:05.260]   the heavens and the earth." Now, I don't know if that's the most important statement
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.100]   in the Bible, but if it isn't, I don't know which statement would be more important
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:13.360]   because everything flows from that. And that's the reason why there's such a battle in
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:19.340]   our common cultures over the origin of man. God is creator or man is evolved accident,
[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:23.340]   happenstance, because everything hinges on that question. If you remove the first few
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:27.900]   chapters from the Bible, the entire thing is incoherent and it falls completely apart.
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:32.060]   So I'm fascinated by that topic and I frankly think that each and every person should be
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:37.580]   fascinated by it because it fundamentally affects all of our life. And I'm not going
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.180]   to go too deeply into the discussion because if I do, I'll misrepresent the focus of
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.660]   the podcast. This show is not a bait and switch where I bait you in to talk about money, then
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:49.820]   switch it out and preach at you. But the show is also not a lie where I tell you that you
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:56.060]   can teach certain things about finance without being affected by worldview. So when I think
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:02.020]   about accountability, I think about accountability for life. That's even why I talk about – it's
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:07.260]   not a bait and switch. I'm accountable to you, the listening audience, to tell you what
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:13.700]   I'm going to do and then do it. I have a list of 16 statements that are very short,
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:23.960]   but to me they underpin this concept of accountability for life in general. But they also underpin
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:30.860]   an accountability for what we do with money. These things create a particularly thorny
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:36.940]   thing – thorny impact for people like me who are talking about money. But I think in
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:44.140]   terms of contrast, so consider these 16 statements and think about how they might apply to the
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:47.420]   question of accountability of life in general and to whom we're accountable for how we
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:52.020]   use money. Feel free to pick either side or anywhere in between.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:57.660]   Number one, if you believe in biblical creation, the idea that God created the heavens and
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:04.820]   the earth, then you believe in a father God who is personal. If you believe in secular
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:11.740]   evolution, then you tend towards the concept of mother nature, which is a mythical cultural
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:17.860]   construct, a concept. If you believe in biblical creation, then you believe that this universe
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:24.740]   was the result of a personal choice. If you believe in secular evolution, then you argue
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:31.540]   that it was a random impersonal chance that has a profound impact on money. If you believe
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:38.060]   in biblical creation, then you believe there was a designed purpose for life. Under secular
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:44.820]   evolution, there's a random pattern. If you believe in biblical creation, the universe
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:52.260]   is a supernatural production. In evolution, it's a natural process. If you believe in
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:59.460]   biblical creation, the whole universe is an open situation, open to personal intervention
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:08.700]   by both God and man. In evolution, we have nature as a closed system that operates itself.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.880]   If you believe in biblical creation, we have the concept of providence, that God cares
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:20.740]   for his creation and provides for it and looks after it. With evolution, we have coincidence.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:27.080]   If anything good happens, it is merely the result of chance. If you believe in biblical
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:33.500]   creation, then we accept that God is free to make something and to make man in his image.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:39.120]   If we accept evolution, we're left with a view that man is free to make God in whatever
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:49.720]   image he chooses out of his imagination. If you believe in biblical creation, God is Lord.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:57.440]   Under evolution, man is Lord. If you believe in biblical creation, we are under divine
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.600]   authority. But if there is no God, we are autonomous as humans and can decide things
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.920]   for ourselves. If we accept God as creator, we accept that there are absolute standards
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:19.480]   of right and wrong. But with secular evolution, we have relative situations. With God's
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:30.160]   creation, we talk of duty and responsibility. With evolution, we talk of demands and rights.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:37.160]   Under God, we have an infinite dependence. We become his little children in biblical
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:44.640]   words and speak to the heavenly Father. With evolution, we are proud of our independence
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:52.000]   and we speak of coming of age and of no longer needing God. According to the Bible, man is
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:00.020]   a fallen creature. According to evolution, man is rising and progressing all the time.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:06.300]   In the Bible, we have salvation for the weak. In evolutionary philosophy, we have the survival
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:14.440]   of the strong. The Bible teaches that you are powerful when you do what is right. Evolutionary
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:24.640]   philosophy leads to a might is right outlook. And here's the key. The Bible says that faith,
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   hope, and love are the three main virtues in life. Secular evolution says that you should
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:38.680]   indulge yourself and look after number one. Now, if you think through that list or if
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.880]   you can bear to listen through it again, each of those I've specifically chosen because
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:52.160]   it has an impact on money. The challenge is that either of those positions requires faith.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.920]   It's kind of interesting. The Bible never proves God's existence. It assumes it. And
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.120]   secular humanists can't disprove God. They assume non-existence. So either way, you're
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:08.880]   left with faith. And I love to study what Christians call apologetics. And I love to
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.680]   have personal conversations with people about the subject. I love the intellectual arguments
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.080]   for and against the existence of God. But the problem is that this is the wrong format
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:26.440]   for that. But either way, you make an assumption and then you build on that assumption. The
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.240]   Bible itself says in the book of Hebrews says, "Whoever comes to God must first believe that
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:38.120]   he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him." And I found that to be true.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:44.280]   Now, the major impact of these perspectives is the concept of accountability. And so for
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:50.680]   me, I believe that I'm accountable to God for everything I do, for all of my actions,
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:57.440]   for everything in my life. I'm accountable to please God in all things. And that includes
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:03.000]   how I use the money that I control. I'll use the term "his money," which I'll come to in
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.780]   a moment. If I were a secular humanist, then I would believe that I'm accountable to myself
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:14.720]   and to please myself. As a Christian, I'm commanded to live with the focus on the next
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:23.440]   life, not this life. If I were a secular humanist, I would live with the focus on this life,
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:32.560]   not the next life. As a Christian, I'm commanded to live with the focus on doing what is right.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.400]   As a humanist, I would live with the focus of gratifying my desires and attaining personal
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:49.600]   happiness. So for me, if I won $10 million in a lottery, I'm accountable to God for how
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.640]   I handle the money. Now, I'm also accountable for how I handle every dollar that flows through
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.280]   my hands today. So then the natural next question would be, "Okay, if I'm accountable for something,
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.880]   then what's the basis upon which I'm held accountable? What's the standard by which
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:10.880]   I'm going to be judged? What am I being held accountable to?" And that's why we need some
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.360]   sort of instruction. I take that instruction from the Bible.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.320]   Now, interestingly, the Bible has a lot to say about money. Here's a statistic that will
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.240]   surprise many people. It certainly surprised me when I first learned it years ago. I think
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:29.840]   it was from a Crown Financial textbook. There are approximately 500 verses in the Bible
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:39.240]   on prayer. There are fewer than 500 verses in the Bible on faith, but there are more
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:48.520]   than 2,350 verses on how to handle money. The Bible has a lot to say about money and
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.700]   it will impact every part of a Christian's life. I'm not going to take the time to go
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.800]   into a defense of why I give the Bible any authority. It's an important discussion, but
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.160]   I'll leave that up to you to research and consider it. I've talked about it in previous
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.840]   shows. But don't assume it. It's an incredibly important question.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:12.920]   But for me, I use the Bible as the basis of this worldview, and I believe that it contains
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.320]   the revealed words of God and is absolutely relevant to our modern situation, especially
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.200]   to what I should do with money each and every single day. Even though much of it is over
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:27.120]   2,000 years old, some of it 4,000 years old, that statement is utterly maddening to many
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:31.300]   people for many reasons. Because if I were to make that claim about almost any other
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:35.880]   book or any other subject, I'd be laughed out of just about any conversation. Imagine
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:42.640]   for a moment my making a claim that a 2,000-year-old math book is perfectly relevant and adequate
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:48.200]   for today's world, or that a 2,000-year-old physics textbook is the latest and greatest,
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:54.600]   how absurd that claim would be. And yet, that's what the Bible claims for itself, and ultimately,
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.200]   I believe it proves it.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.920]   Now, if I assume the authority of Scripture and I wish to apply what it says to do about
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:07.880]   money, does that make it easy to know what to do in every situation? Not the least little
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:14.840]   bit. Because first, much of it was written thousands of years ago. They didn't have
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:24.600]   IRAs 3,000 years ago. But more importantly, you've got to build these things together
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:30.640]   in a coherent fashion. I'll link to a PDF outlining the verses in the Bible that discuss
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.880]   money if any of you are interested in actually looking at it. But please, don't just take
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:40.280]   a verse individually and try to build on it without understanding the overall framework
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:46.200]   for each statement and verse. That ends in disaster. In the same way that perhaps an
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.760]   example would be that just because you have the U.S. Constitution written out doesn't
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:56.640]   mean that there's no question as to interpretation and application. In the same way, just because
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.960]   you have the Bible written out, even if you assume what I assume, which many people don't,
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:04.520]   it doesn't mean that you don't have to work out your interpretation of what it says.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:09.200]   And even if you believe, as I do, that the Bible is divinely inspired but the U.S. Constitution
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.880]   is not, then it still doesn't mean that just because it's divinely inspired that it's easy
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.520]   to figure out in certain circumstances. And there are many reasons for this, and I'll
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:25.840]   just share a few examples that might be interesting to you. One of the biggest reasons is to recognize
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.760]   that the Bible is not really one book. In many ways, it's actually a library of books,
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.840]   all of which have their own impact and their own purpose. There are books of history, and
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:42.760]   this is what a lot of people, often who haven't dug into it a little bit, don't perceive.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.120]   There are books of history, there are books of stories, there are books of prophecy, there
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.060]   are books of law, books of poetry, books of proverbs, which are simply collections of
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:59.680]   wise sayings, books of instruction, personal letters, there's songbooks and hymnbooks,
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:06.200]   there's even blueprints with careful measurements and census reports of censuses of a population.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.080]   There are at least two books in the Bible that don't say a thing about God, not one
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:14.760]   word. There's an entire book in the Bible that's all about the young love of a man and
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:21.600]   a woman and their sexual relationship as young lovers. It's quite scandalous, actually, for
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.620]   young boys and girls who read through their Bibles. I used to love reading through the
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.280]   scandalous parts of the Bible while sitting in church service as a boy. There's a verse
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.520]   in the Bible that's very explicit in its description of masturbation, and you can feel
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:37.120]   like quite the naughty little boy sitting in church, in a church meeting, reading about
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:45.000]   that. Or quite explicit of discussions of just crazy stories. There's all kinds of
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.060]   crazy stories. There's a girl in the Bible named Jail who kills a guy named Sisera by
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:54.540]   driving a tent peg through his skull while he was sleeping. Sisera had been in a battle
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:57.760]   and they were being attacked and overrun, and he ran away on foot trying to find a place
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.200]   that he could hide, and he asked this girl to hide him in her tent, and he was exhausted
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:07.040]   from fighting all day. He fell asleep and she came in with a hammer and a tent peg and
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:14.560]   pounded the tent peg through his skull. Crazy. There's a story of a guy named Ehud who is
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:21.400]   a left-handed military guy, and he straps a sword to his right leg, and he went in to
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.040]   see the king. And so most people were right-handed, so they would usually just check the left
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.640]   leg for weapons to see if he had a hidden sword. So he straps his sword to his right
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.680]   leg, a short 18-inch sword, and he smuggles it into a private meeting with the king, and
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.240]   then in the middle of the meeting, pulls out a sword and plunges it into the king's belly.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:47.800]   And those are just two interesting stories that I love. I love that the Bible never shrinks
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.340]   back from accurately depicting accounts, and it always shows the whole person and exposes
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:58.440]   the good and the evil honestly and accurately, and it shows a person's strengths and weaknesses.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.520]   And it's incredible when you get into it. There's stories of mass killings and stories
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:08.360]   of rape and incest and seduction and betrayal and stories of heroism and villainy and justice
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.880]   and injustice and good and evil, and some parts are inspiring and uplifting and others
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:20.320]   are downright depressing. And when you think about why certain books were included that
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.840]   were included, then you have to ask why were others excluded that were excluded? There
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.960]   are other ancient books of history that are true and accurate but aren't in there. I'll
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.680]   tempt you with that question and let you work on the answer. But you have to approach all
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:39.200]   these texts carefully, because they all have different reasons for being written and different
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:45.140]   reasons for being included. I can't make a philosophy about killing people by driving
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:51.440]   tent pegs through their skull just because it's included in the Bible. So in the same
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.240]   way that there are various schools of thoughts of how to apply the content of the US Constitution
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.520]   written over 200 years ago to the common day in a very different world, there are schools
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:06.480]   of thought that range widely on how to apply thousands of year old documents to a modern
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:14.680]   world. And you'll have to search it out. It's not an easy thing to do.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.880]   It's – I'll give you just one example of the challenge of interpreting scripture.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.760]   In my household, we have breakfast together every morning and after breakfast, we read
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.000]   from the Bible. And this morning, I was reading – we were reading the book of Luke and I
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.100]   read this passage and I think this is the first time I've ever read a Bible passage
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.400]   on the show, but I think it's appropriate here. It's just a funny, fun little story
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:38.720]   and it's from a modern translation. And you ask yourself what this means. So here's
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.320]   the passage from the book of Luke. "Jesus told this story to his disciples. There was
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.440]   a certain rich man who had a manager handling his affairs. One day a report came that the
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.480]   manager was wasting his employer's money. So the employer called him in and said, 'What's
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:59.340]   this I hear about you? Get your report in order because you are going to be fired.'
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:04.640]   The manager thought to himself, 'Now what? My boss has fired me. I don't have the strength
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.800]   to dig ditches and I'm too proud to beg. Ah, I know how to ensure that I'll have
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:14.040]   plenty of friends who will give me a home when I'm fired.' So he invited each person
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.600]   who owed money to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.040]   one, 'How much do you owe him?' The man replied, 'I owe him 800 gallons of olive
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.480]   oil.' So the manager told him, 'Take the bill and quickly change it to 400 gallons.'
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:32.600]   'And how much do you owe my employer?' he asked the next man. 'I owe him a thousand
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.640]   bushels of wheat,' was the reply. 'Here,' the manager said, 'take the bill and change
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:44.400]   it to 800 bushels.' The rich man had to admire the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.680]   And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.520]   around them than are the children of light. Here's the lesson. Use your worldly resources
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:58.480]   to benefit others and make friends. Then, when your earthly possessions are gone, they
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.960]   will welcome you to an eternal home. If you are faithful in little things, you will be
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.580]   faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won't be honest with
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:15.040]   greater responsibilities. And if you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.520]   the true riches of heaven? And if you are not faithful with other people's things,
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:25.040]   why should you be trusted with things of your own? No one can serve two masters, for you
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.160]   will hate one and love the other. You will be devoted to one and despise the other. You
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:36.680]   cannot serve both God and money." That's one of my favorite stories from the Bible,
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:42.600]   just 'cause I love the way that this particular translation puts it. The rich man had to admire
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.760]   the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd. But the question is, okay, what do I do with
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:56.200]   that? What was Jesus trying to teach? And that's your homework, and my homework.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:03.280]   Now my purpose here has been to establish the concept of accountability. I start from
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.580]   the perspective that I am accountable for how I live my life in every way, and I'm accountable
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:15.600]   for all of my actions, all of my words, how I spend my time, and how I spend my money.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:22.960]   I would point out to you that our society also, to some degree, holds people accountable
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:29.080]   for how we live our lives, how we spend our time, how we spend our money. And what we're
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:36.680]   held accountable to changes. The question is, on what basis do we hold one another accountable?
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:43.920]   The next concept you need to understand is the question of sovereignty. The question
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:49.720]   of sovereignty is essentially, who's in charge here? And obviously there are various responses
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:55.320]   depending on worldview. I believe the correct one is that God is in charge. He is fully
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:00.960]   sovereign. He is in control and in charge. Now, as I shared earlier, I hated that when
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.360]   I was younger. In fact, it was the number one thing that kept me from being a Christian
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.200]   for the first 20 years of my life. I wanted to be sovereign over my life. I didn't want
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.680]   to cede my sovereignty to another person. I knew that was what God required, and I was
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:18.040]   always scared of what that might mean. I was scared of what God might make me do. After
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:26.400]   all, sin is fun, and I wanted to have my fun. Sin is a lot of fun for a time, and I did.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.760]   But ultimately though, I surrendered my sovereignty and my life changed dramatically. Now, if
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.640]   God is sovereign, then you have to ask the question which many people don't ask, "How
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:45.480]   do I reconcile the situation that I face in my life? To what extent is God sovereign?
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:53.240]   Do I sit back and pray, or do I get up and work, or do I do both of those things?" If
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:57.280]   God is sovereign and in control, then what do I do with the situation I'm in? If I'm
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:04.980]   poor, why? If I'm rich, why? That's not strictly limited to money. The classic version
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:10.920]   of this question is something that keeps many, many people from a belief in God. The philosophers
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.440]   call it theodicy, or you could just simply refer to it as they call the problem of evil,
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.060]   which is in short, if there's a good God who's all powerful, why would he permit evil
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:27.680]   in the world? That's a bedrock of many philosophical debates about the existence of God. And more
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:33.800]   importantly, it's a bedrock of many non-philosophers, normal peoples, their objection to God. If
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.040]   God's good, how could he allow my mother to die, or my Uncle Joe to get cancer, or
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:44.680]   me to get raped, or my child to be disabled, etc. But the corollary is, "Wait a second,
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:50.440]   why would God allow us to be poor?" Or even stated differently, "Why would God make
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:56.160]   us poor?" Now, many people ask that question, but they don't ask the other question, "Why
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:03.320]   would God allow us to be rich, or make us rich?" That's an important question. Again,
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.480]   I'll challenge you with it. The Bible teaches the sovereignty of God in my current circumstances.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:16.320]   He's in control. The Bible does not teach deism. Deism is a belief that there is a God,
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:22.160]   or at least there was a God, who created the world, but that God does not intervene with
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:25.520]   the functioning of the natural world, but rather allows it to function according to
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.600]   the laws of nature. Deism is extremely common in our world today, and in my opinion, it's
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:38.280]   probably the most common spiritual viewpoint, especially among success writers, success
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.920]   coaches, success personalities, people who talk about money. I often observe this in
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:48.680]   reading about money, in reading books, personal finance books. The writers will often offer
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:56.120]   a nod to the existence of God, or at least to some sort of non-material spiritual entity,
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:01.440]   but they pull back from discussing the actual involvement of God in our actual circumstances
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:09.840]   of life. Why? Well, probably many reasons, but primarily it's super tough to talk about
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:16.000]   God's involvement without alienating a substantial portion of your audience. Obviously, there
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.480]   are many perspectives. There are many different human philosophies that will majorly affect
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:28.480]   your view of money, whether you're atheism, agnosticism, animism, polytheism, dualism,
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:34.560]   monotheism, deism, theism, existentialism, humanism, rationalism, materialism, mysticism,
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.000]   monism, pantheism, panantheism. There's just a few, but each of those viewpoints will
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.720]   dramatically affect your viewpoint on life in general and on money in specific. But even
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:49.620]   if you were, let's say that you were going to come from the perspective of what I do
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:55.560]   as far as a Christian, and I believe the Bible teaches triune theism. God is three in one
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.840]   and is creator and controller of the universe, which means God not only created the world
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:05.400]   but is also currently in control of everything. Different people will take that and they will
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:10.640]   start to apply different teachings from at the far end, come and give to God and God
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:16.200]   will make you rich, to at the other end, God says give everything away and be poor, give
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:23.560]   everything away. So I don't fault most speakers and success gurus from shying away from the
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:29.040]   topic. I face this challenge each and every day and I often want to run from it. How on
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.080]   earth, I ask myself, how on earth do you speak to a general audience filled with people from
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:39.520]   many philosophical backgrounds and teach truth without causing intentional offense? I'm
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:43.440]   not sure I do it well at all. I really don't think I do. I'm learning and I'm working
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:53.440]   at it. And more importantly, how do you integrate the idea of God being in control over my situation?
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:04.960]   My specific situation? And then figuring out what my proper response would be to that situation.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:11.320]   I won't try to answer that question for you. It's not an easy question in any way, shape,
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:19.600]   or form. If God is in control over my situation, my specific situation, then what is my proper
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:29.160]   response to the circumstances that I currently face? Now for me, the reason why that question
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:38.280]   of sovereignty is so important is this. I don't believe in chance. The discussion of
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:44.960]   the idea of chance or luck is a real challenge for Christians, but for me I don't believe
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:50.320]   in chance or luck. And so if I inherited $10 million, or even if I won it in a lottery,
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:56.480]   I would have to believe that God is sovereign and there's a purpose for it. There's a reason
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:05.080]   for it. And I'm responsible for it. Now here's where I give you one of my favorite
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.600]   tidbits that I think you'll enjoy regardless of your own personal background, and this
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:13.760]   is what I promised for you as your tidbit if you've gotten, if you're a secular person,
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:19.440]   if you've gotten through to this point with all of my Bible quoting, here's your ammo
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:23.360]   that you'll enjoy in a conversation with a Christian at some point.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:28.000]   Christians have a penchant for certain Bible verses, and some verses are common to many
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.360]   people. Christians like to have their favorite verse. I don't have a problem with that. I
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:36.640]   have a few that I find particularly comforting to my situation, but I enjoy a few of them.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.800]   But there are two in particular that often stand out. If you were to poll a group of
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:46.400]   Christians, and many people who would affiliate and self-identify as Christians are kind of
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:52.280]   nominal Christians, have a general idea of belief in God, and if you ask for a Bible
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:57.880]   verse and ask them for their favorite verse, I believe two of these verses would rise to
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:05.320]   the top. One is a verse that is in Jeremiah 29 11, is the scripture reference for it,
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:09.820]   where it says, "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:17.000]   you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future." That's a very popular
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:26.200]   verse. The second verse is a passage in Philippians 4 4 13, which says, "I can do all things
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:31.600]   through Christ who strengthens me." That was probably the more famous one.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.000]   Now the challenge is many Christians are simply not very rigorous in understanding their own
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.060]   faith, and it's a real tragedy that has wide-ranging repercussions in our lives. And
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:44.440]   many Christians especially are not rigorous in their understanding of the interpretation
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.640]   and application of scripture. So if you want to challenge a Christian a bit, here's what
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.600]   you can do. Ask them what their favorite verse is, and ask them, maybe they'll say it's
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:58.960]   Philippians 4 13, and ask them to quote it and quote it for them, "I can do all things
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.880]   through Christ who strengthens me." And ask them what are some of the things that they
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:09.160]   can do with Christ that they can't do without Christ, and see what they say.
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:13.800]   Now usually you'll hear many things. My answer to that question in the past might have been
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.560]   something like, "Well, I can honor my boss and obey my boss with a good attitude at my
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:23.520]   job," or, "I can take a hard final exam and do well on it," or, "I can go through
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:30.440]   the death of a close friend." And that answer that I would have given in the past is to
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:36.040]   my own shame. Because although those things may be true, and it's possible that that Bible
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:42.840]   verse could be a comfort to me, that's not what the Bible verse is talking about. That
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:51.680]   verse is talking about money. Specifically, how to live on your income. And I'll read
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.800]   it to you in context, choosing a slightly different translation than what I just quoted,
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.140]   but in context, a guy named Paul is writing this passage and he says, "How I praise the
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:07.680]   Lord that you are concerned about me again. I know you have not always been concerned
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.360]   for me, but you didn't have the chance to help me. Not that I was ever in need, for
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:18.640]   I have learned how to be content with whatever I have. I know how to live on almost nothing
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:24.760]   or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:32.120]   with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little, for I can do everything through
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:38.520]   Christ who gives me strength. Even so, you've done well to share with me in my present difficulty."
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:49.560]   He's talking about money and specifically how to live on your income. How to be content
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:54.120]   with a full stomach or an empty and with plenty or with little. Now, if you're a Christian
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.280]   and I've caught you out a bit with your understanding of that verse, don't be too ashamed. I was
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:02.160]   there myself in the past and I was thoroughly embarrassed by my lack of rigor in going through
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.040]   and understanding that passage. And if you're not a Christian, enjoy the ammunition to catch
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.880]   out your friends. That's my present to you. I won't even comment on Jeremiah 29 11, except
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.800]   to challenge you that if you've ever claimed that verse for your so-called life verse,
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:20.280]   read the entire book of Jeremiah and the 29 chapters before that, before you claim that.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.240]   And I'll challenge that. But my reason that I bring that up is for two reasons. God knows
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.720]   what I need and when I need it. And that passage goes on to discuss the economy of Christians,
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:37.280]   which is based on shareling liberally with those in need. That's an interesting integration
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:45.880]   to a system of money. And that's where I live. If I have need, I'm confident that my needs
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:55.120]   will be met. So you say, "How do you teach that?" Well, that's where you'd have to kind
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.800]   of discern your audience a little bit, which is why I don't generally go into those things
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:08.220]   on the podcast. But it has major impact. The other impact of that is that I can actually
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:12.440]   know God in whatever my circumstances, and I can be faithful when I have a lot and when
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:20.000]   I have a little. And so there are reasons for the circumstances that I face. And God
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.400]   is sovereign, and that discussion of God's sovereignty establishes the idea that God
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.320]   has a reason for the circumstances that I face. There's a reason for $10 million, and
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.760]   there's a reason for $10.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:39.280]   So the next natural question is, what is my responsibility in this deal? In my mind, there
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:45.320]   are two important things, stewardship and faithfulness. And these are kind of funny
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:52.800]   words. Stewardship is largely a lost concept in modern culture. Probably the best example
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:58.400]   would be a financial advisor's stewardship over their client's assets. If you are a
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.520]   financial advisor and you're a steward over your client's assets, then those assets need
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:09.040]   to be expended and invested in line with the master, the client, the master's goals.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:15.040]   Historically, wealth was physical. So you needed a steward to handle your affairs. If
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.200]   you were going to take a trip, you couldn't just jump on an airplane and drive to the
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.400]   other side of the world and open up your Vanguard account and click, click, click through the
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:29.720]   internet browser, manage all of your portfolio. It was physical. It was houses and farms and
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:39.480]   vineyards, and physical forms of wealth, gold, silver. So the Bible is replete with stories
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:45.080]   about masters and stewards. And the master entrusts money to a steward and goes on a
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:50.560]   trip. Then when the master returns, he demands an accounting of the steward's actions. There
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.240]   are many, many, many stories on that theme.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.920]   If you are vaguely familiar with Christian teaching, you would think of something like
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:05.720]   the parable of the talents. These stories teach that that is the Christian situation.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:11.720]   The master is away on a trip and we are here on this earth as stewards of the master's
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:18.920]   resources. And one day, the master will return and demand an accounting from us. So the major
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:26.400]   life challenge of the Christian standard is this. Nothing is mine. Nothing belongs to
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:37.720]   me. Because when you become a Christian, you become a slave to God. So that means that
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:43.440]   it's not my money, it's not my time, it's not my talents, not my abilities, it's not
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:50.240]   my life, it's not even my physical life. When you become a follower of Christ, one
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:54.600]   of the prerequisites for that being a true statement is the acknowledgement of a total
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:30:02.960]   transference of sovereignty, a laying down of your own life, an entry into a form of
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:10.120]   slavery. And that's a major change. Most of us have lived our lives in a way that doesn't
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:13.880]   acknowledge the sovereignty of another. We are sovereign over our own lives and that's
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.960]   how I used to live.
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:20.680]   And interestingly, this isn't actually true. We're not actually sovereign over our own
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:24.120]   lives in fullness, even though we live as though it is true. It's not actually true
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.920]   because there are always events that are outside all of our control. As your homeowner's
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:33.440]   insurance policy says, "Some things are an act of God." But when you acknowledge,
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:39.600]   when you become a Christian and you acknowledge another's sovereignty over your life, then
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:45.040]   you're recognizing something that's true in a measure and then you're now living in
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:50.680]   accordance with it. And any time you can live in harmony with God's law, you can experience
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:57.120]   the blessings of it. The Bible says in the book of Psalms and the book of Proverbs that
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:02.000]   the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. It's almost the right ordering of your life.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.480]   So I view money in this way. I'm simply a steward of the money. It's not mine. And
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:10.540]   that's an extremely unusual viewpoint in the modern world because we're trained to
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:14.080]   think of money as mine. It's mine to do what I want with. It's mine to enjoy how
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:21.200]   I like. But it's not. It's not for me. I'm a steward. It's not mine. Now, don't
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.560]   for an instant think that I'm a perfect steward. I'm not. I'm learning and I hope
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:28.640]   I'm increasing in my faithfulness. But if you think about the concept of stewardship,
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:34.040]   it brings in a balance and a tension because a steward should be using the master's resources
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:38.280]   to achieve the master's goals. So then you have to ask, "What's the first question?
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.880]   What are the master's goals?" And here's the tension. One of the master's goals is
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:46.920]   that the steward is being cared for. It's important that a steward of a household be
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:51.040]   provided for. If you were left in charge of somebody's estate, you need a bedroom to
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:57.760]   stay in and you need clothes to wear. So the steward of a household needs to be cared for.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.160]   Otherwise, there are many problems that could happen. You could even say that it would probably
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:08.920]   be the joy of the master for the steward to be well cared for and well provided for. You
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:14.280]   should want this for all of the people that you do business with. I want the vendors with
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:19.120]   whom I'm doing business or the business partners, I want them to be making very nice
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:24.480]   profits so they'll stay in business. You want your employees to be very well paid so
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.760]   that they're happy and content. I'm actually very leery myself of free software and free
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:33.880]   products without a business model behind them because I know they're unlikely to be well
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:39.240]   supported and are likely to disappear. That's why every business needs a sound business
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:43.920]   model. That's why many of you send me emails from time to time and say, "Joshua, what's
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.800]   your business model?" because you like the show and you want it to be here. Without a
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.600]   business model, it's not going to be here. I'm working on that. Details coming soon.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.000]   But you don't want the steward to be taken care of more than the master. You don't want
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.620]   the steward's goals to take a higher priority than the master's goals. So consider the anger
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:07.680]   that you would rightly feel toward a financial advisor who is doing better than the client.
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:11.880]   The financial advisor is taking all the money and the client's not getting any of it. You
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:20.300]   would be rightly justified in your anger. So that tension is healthy as far as, well,
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:26.840]   what are the master's goals and how much is too much for the steward to be cared for?
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:33.820]   Now I can't answer the question of, for you, what are the master's goals? It's a big question.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:37.260]   But I'll answer in a moment the ones that I feel are important for me to be involved
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:44.720]   with. So that concept of stewardship radically changes the discussion of money, which brings
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:50.500]   us to the final point that I need to discuss of worldview that you need to understand,
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:59.180]   and that's the concept of faithfulness. I must be faithful in all things at all times.
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:04.600]   This is one of the overarching teachings of Scripture. It's that I must be faithful exactly
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.940]   where I am. It's an unusual word or character quality in our modern world. We don't talk
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:16.040]   much about concepts of virtue or character qualities. But consider if that character
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:21.520]   quality or that virtue of faithfulness might not be something that you value. Would you
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:31.320]   like a faithful spouse? Would you enjoy having a faithful employee? Do you want to have a
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:40.800]   faithful brother or sister or faithful parent? Do you value a faithful friend? Would it be
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:48.640]   a joy to work with a faithful business partner? Do you want a faithful child? That's what's
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:57.720]   taught to Christians. What's taught is no matter your circumstances, you must be faithful.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:03.680]   You must be faithful to God in every circumstance, both in the visible common things and in the
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:09.240]   hidden secret things. You must be faithful to your employer in the things that are seen,
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:16.080]   but also in what is unseen. You don't steal the stapler just because no one knows it's
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:22.440]   gone. You must be faithful to your employer. In biblical times, human slavery was common.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.200]   In fact, throughout the Bible, the people of God actually went in and out of slavery
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:31.040]   multiple times with multiple masters. But slaves were always commanded to be faithful
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.960]   to their masters, regardless of circumstance. And the responsibility went the other way
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.680]   too. Masters of slaves were commanded to be faithful to their slaves and to treat them
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:45.480]   with dignity and respect and fairness. In the same way, employers are commanded to be
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:52.560]   just. Rulers of government are commanded to rule with fairness. Husbands and wives are
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.200]   commanded to be faithful to one another. Children are commanded to be faithful and obedient
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:00.760]   to their parents. It's across the board. So why should I even bother with that? Why
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.440]   should I even bother to be faithful? Well, there's many reasons. One, it's honoring
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:10.880]   to God and He will repay you according to your works. Again and again and again throughout
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.960]   the Bible, there are examples after examples after examples of faithfulness and faithlessness
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:21.960]   and the ensuing results. One of my favorites is a guy named Joseph, and what's amazing,
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:25.600]   almost a third of the book of Genesis is devoted to his story. If you're not familiar with
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:30.840]   the story, Joseph was sold into slavery by his own brothers because he was jealous, they
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:36.920]   were jealous of him. But as a slave, he was faithful to his master, a man named Potiphar,
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:43.080]   who was the captain of Pharaoh's guard, kind of in charge of the elite special forces of
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:49.280]   his day. But even though he was a slave and he was sold into slavery, he was faithful
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.040]   and he was raised from the lowest place of a common slave and he was put in charge as
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:37:00.340]   the chief steward of Potiphar's house. He was in many ways the second in command and
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:06.200]   nothing was done in that estate without his approval. And the Bible says that Potiphar's
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:13.200]   household was blessed because of Joseph's service. He experienced great gain and financial
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:19.560]   increase. Now, what's amazing, Joseph was faithful to his master, Potiphar, even when
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.640]   Potiphar's wife wanted to have sex with him. He was good looking and she advanced upon
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:29.320]   him and was entreating or rather commanding him to have sex with her and he ran away.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.480]   He ran out of the house naked, leaving her holding his clothes. And so immediately she
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:39.040]   got angry at him for disobeying her orders and she accused him of attempted rape and
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:44.280]   falsely accused him of attempted rape. So Potiphar, the dude in charge, gets home and
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:48.800]   he hears the accusation and the story from his wife and he throws Joseph, the slave,
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:59.640]   in prison. So Joseph was enslaved unjustly and then he was imprisoned unjustly. He acted
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:07.120]   righteously and was imprisoned because he acted righteously. But even though he was
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.840]   imprisoned unjustly, he's faithful in prison and over time he's promoted to be in charge
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:18.700]   over the whole prison, even to the point where the free man, who was the keeper of the prison,
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:22.000]   just didn't even bother to pay attention to anything that Joseph was in charge of. He
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.360]   just went about his own life and dealt with a few things that he was caring for because
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.520]   he knew that Joseph would handle it. So he's in charge of the entire prison as a prisoner.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:36.600]   Now over time, through a series of circumstances, the opportunity comes that he has an audience
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:41.680]   with Pharaoh to interpret a dream that Pharaoh has and Pharaoh winds up taking him out of
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:48.680]   prison and promoting him to be second in command over all of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.500]   And miraculously, because of his installation as second in command, he's able to save not
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:57.760]   only the nation of Egypt from famine, but even his entire family. It's an incredible
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.620]   story. Joseph is the only person I'm aware of in the Old Testament who's presented as
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:07.880]   a man of total integrity, where we're only told about his strengths. Everyone else, we
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:11.660]   see their strengths and their weaknesses, their successes and their failures, but with
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:19.540]   Joseph it's only integrity and strength. Or if we talk about faithlessness and the
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:24.500]   compensation and rewards of faithlessness, one of my favorite stories would be Jacob,
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:32.020]   Joseph's father. And so Jacob, he's a conniving cheat from the beginning of his life. He's
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:37.260]   a conniving cheat and he's born. He has a twin brother named Esau, and later on as adults
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:41.580]   he cheats his own brother out of his brother's inheritance, his brother's portion of the
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:46.540]   inheritance, in exchange for a meal. And then later in life, in cahoots with his mother,
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:52.980]   he cheats his own father out of giving the patriarchal blessing to Esau, and he cheats
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:59.480]   his father out of the blessing by wearing animal skin, so he's furry, so he smells like
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:07.020]   his brother, who's a bit of an outdoor roustabout. And then in fear of his life from his brother,
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.020]   who's much stronger and much more vigorous, he runs away from his brother and he flees
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:17.060]   to a relative's house, to his uncle's house. But one of my favorite stories, he gets his
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:23.500]   due in return. Probably the funniest verse in the Bible surrounds his marriage. His uncle
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:26.780]   is a guy named Laban, and his uncle has two daughters. He has a pretty daughter named
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:32.100]   Rachel and a not so pretty daughter named Leah. And so Jacob wants to marry Rachel,
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:37.580]   and so he makes a deal with his uncle to work for his uncle for seven years, hard labor
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:42.900]   in exchange for Rachel's hand in marriage. So after seven years, they have the wedding
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:47.980]   ceremony and presumably he drinks a lot, and it's a big feast, and presumably he drinks
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:53.020]   a lot, and then he goes into the tent with his wife for the wedding night. One of the
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:41:02.780]   funnier verses in the Bible says, "And then in the morning, behold, it was Leah." His
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:09.260]   uncle swapped in the not so pretty wife for the pretty wife. So that's a rough way to
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:13.080]   start your marriage, finding yourself married to the wrong woman and finding yourself cheated
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:17.700]   out of access to the pretty sister. Now, anyway, I'll leave it there, and if you're interested,
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:21.180]   go find the rest of the story. It's quite good. If you do read it, you might ask yourself
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:26.300]   a challenging question about marriage. If you're of the mind to account for a quick
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:30.860]   and easy divorce, then why didn't Jacob simply divorce Leah immediately and marry Rachel?
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:35.580]   After all, he was completely tricked. So consider that. But then again, if you're familiar with
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:38.740]   the passage and what happens after the story, you should immediately argue back with me
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.640]   and say, "Oh yeah? Well then why was Jacob permitted later to go ahead and marry the
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:45.740]   pretty one and have a polygamous marriage?" And I would say, "Touché," and we'll save
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:49.820]   that important and interesting discussion for a different format than a personal finance
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:55.060]   podcast. Back to money. There are other reasons to be faithful. It's an example to men and
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:42:01.220]   women around. It may even result in increased personal gain. The Bible says if you're faithful
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.900]   in little things, you'll be faithful in large ones. But if you're dishonest in little things,
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:09.420]   you won't be honest with greater responsibility. And if you're untrustworthy about worldly
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:13.340]   wealth, who's going to trust you the true riches of heaven? And if you're not faithful
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:17.780]   with other people's things, why should you be trusted with the things of your own? So
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:22.700]   I must be faithful with how I handle money because it's a test of how I handle more
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:25.940]   important things.
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:35.340]   Now with that as background of my worldview, my answers as to what I would do if I unexpectedly
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:41.460]   received a $10 million windfall will make a little bit more sense to you. If I received
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:46.500]   that unexpected windfall, I would be sure that there is a very important reason or perhaps
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:53.220]   many very important reasons for me to receive it. And I'd hit my knees at the weight of
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:56.860]   that responsibility, praying that I would have the ability to be faithful with it and
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:02.660]   not give in to temptation to turn aside. Because when you view money in the way that I do,
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:08.100]   you might quickly recognize the tremendous responsibility that comes in with money. To
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:15.220]   whom much is given, much is required. And I've already been given much. And thus, much
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:20.460]   is already required of me. But at least my experience so far has been incremental, little
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:25.340]   things at a time, able to grow in responsibility step by step by step. But to all of a sudden
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:31.500]   receive a ton of money all at once would be a massive responsibility. There's a proverb
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:36.220]   that says, "Give me neither poverty nor riches. Give me just enough to satisfy my
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:40.580]   needs. For if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, 'Who is the Lord?' And if I am
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:47.100]   too poor, I may steal and thus insult God's holy name." So the first thing I would do
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:50.700]   would be to try to understand what is the purpose of the money. Maybe there's some
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:55.000]   monster financial need that's going to present itself and the money just needs to go right
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.600]   through me. Maybe it's 10 million to me and all of a sudden, boom, there's a need
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:04.300]   for 10 million dollars and it all needs to be given away. I don't know. The hypotheticals
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:10.140]   are always dangerous because they remove God's sovereignty from the situation. When we get
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:14.300]   into if this, then that, we're often constructing life scenarios in which we don't actually
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:19.380]   know facts. It's one thing to have a discussion about something that has actually happened,
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:23.220]   but it's tough to know the reasons behind hypothetical situations. So that's one of
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:26.100]   the whole dangers of even my answering it, but I'm going to take the bait and answer
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:27.100]   in specifics.
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:31.860]   So specifically my approach though, assuming that there's not some massive need right
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:36.340]   in front of me that I quickly become aware of that I need to give the money to. Again,
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:39.300]   there's a need for 10 million dollars and I just sense, "Okay, I need to give the
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:44.140]   money to that." Then I would be just simply integrating the money into the normal flow
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:52.300]   of my life with my current financial priorities. Here's specifically what I would do. I
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:56.280]   think I'd probably set aside maybe two to three million dollars of the 10 million dollars
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.300]   for my needs and the needs of my family. I think that's a number that would very well
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:05.900]   provide for exactly what we need in comfort.
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:10.860]   I would first pay off my mortgage. I owe about $160,000 on my mortgage. With numbers that
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:16.820]   big, the theoretical financial benefit from having a low rate fixed interest mortgage
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:25.380]   payment as compared to the emotional peace of mind for my family is utterly meaningless.
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:31.940]   In my current scenario, the financial benefit of having that mortgage is very meaningful.
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:35.820]   But with 10 million dollars in the bank, it wouldn't be at all meaningful. So I'd
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:41.300]   just be mortgage free in very short order and enjoy the emotional peace of mind that
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:43.280]   comes from that.
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:47.700]   There are a few things I would buy. I would buy some stand-up paddle boards, believe it
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:52.780]   or not. It costs me like, I don't know, about $1,400 or so. Stand-up paddle boards
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:56.340]   have been on my list for a very, very long time. I've been waiting to get some for
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:46:01.260]   like three or four years. I just haven't been able to justify the price. They're
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:05.700]   super in demand and the prices haven't come down like I thought they would. The toughest
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:09.620]   thing about them is that I'm a big guy and so the extra big ones, I need a big one,
[01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:13.540]   are extra expensive. So I'd get a big one for me and a little one for my wife.
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:18.620]   I think a stand-up paddle board is actually my ideal version of a boat. I don't really
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:23.180]   want the hassle of owning an actual boat, especially not at my current life stage. It's
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:28.020]   a major pain and especially if it's just a part-time hobby, it's a major pain. But
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:31.140]   it's super nice where I live to be able to get out on the water on a Friday evening
[01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:34.900]   with my family and stand-up paddle boards would be ideal for that type of family outing,
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:40.340]   especially where I live. That or a canoe can also work, something like that. You put a
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:44.820]   cooler on there and a couple of chairs and you paddle over to a little island somewhere,
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:48.580]   a little sandy island on the beach or something like that and have a nice little picnic on
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:53.780]   the beach. There's no hassle. There's no motors that you have to maintain. There's
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:57.980]   no stickers that you have to buy. It's just a lot easier and it gets you out on the water
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:02.420]   and it gives a good source of exercise, kind of stacking the benefits together.
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:05.180]   Maybe later in life, I want a boat when my kids are older and they can enjoy it with
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:09.060]   me but I just don't see it right now. I just assume if I want to go fishing, I just
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:12.940]   assume charter a big boat and do the fishing party instead of having the hassle of owning
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:17.020]   a boat. Incidentally, if any of you have any ideas for how to get a good deal on stand-up
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:19.820]   paddle board, let me know because I've been looking for a long time and I've never
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:23.820]   been able to find a deal. So that's the first thing on my buy list.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:26.980]   The second thing, I've only got three things by the way. The second thing is I buy one
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:31.500]   of those nice big fancy iMacs for my wife and a big fancy Mac laptop for me. I'd like
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:36.460]   my wife to have one just so she can do her artsy stuff. We have a perfectly powerful
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:41.140]   older Windows desktop that she uses but something about having all the fancy creative stuff
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:46.180]   on the Apple that integrated together would be fun to have. She likes making picture books
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:51.380]   and things like that. I think she'd enjoy having it all integrated. If I all of a sudden
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:56.300]   received that kind of windfall, it would make me happy to give her one. I get a fancy laptop
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:59.860]   for me. My current laptop works fine but it's kind of slow. I've just never been able
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:05.620]   to justify the expense of Apple products. I've just never been able to justify them.
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:08.620]   But with $10 million in the bank, I think I'd go ahead and splurge.
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:13.460]   Then finally, I'd buy an RV and I'd probably buy a fancier one than otherwise I would.
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:18.220]   I don't know. Maybe I'd spend $150,000 on a nice diesel pusher or $100,000. I don't
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:22.700]   know. I've wanted an RV for a long time and I love to drive and I love road trips. One
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:25.820]   of the major reasons that I built Radical Personal Finance in the way that I did is
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:31.820]   so that it could fund a lifestyle regardless of where I live. An RV is an ideal way to
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:37.300]   do that for me. So I guess I'd spend like $260,000 of it on those things, paying off
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:40.700]   the mortgage and those fun little toys.
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:45.500]   More importantly, I'd set up an income plan. I'd set up an income plan for my family's
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:50.860]   financial needs. It would look something like this. I think I'd buy on the order of about
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:55.820]   five rental houses plus one for every child. So today, that would be seven. We have two
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:01.260]   kids and five rental houses plus one for each child. I'd pay cash and I'd just have the
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:06.260]   rental money as a backup financial independence plan. I'd follow John Schaub's plan for that.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:11.180]   I'd buy some single family, three two houses, carefully chosen, not in necessarily the rental
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:15.700]   market. So let's just say in my market they cost $200,000 each and there's seven of them.
[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:20.980]   That'd be about a million four. That's basically the backup in case my business fails. That's
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:23.140]   more than enough money to live on.
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:30.820]   Conservatively, I would net in my rental market, conservatively net after expenses, $1,200
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:37.740]   a month. So $1,200 a month times five, that's $6,000 a month plus one for each child. It
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.460]   would give me a ton of wiggle room. That's far more money than I need, especially right
[01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:44.340]   now. Who knows? Maybe later as my family grows, we'll need more. I don't know. But it's more
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:45.860]   than I need now.
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:50.580]   The idea behind the one house per child is a dream of mine. I'd love to help each of
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:55.740]   my kids buy a house by the time they're in about their 20s or so. I'm super inspired
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:50:01.700]   by Steve Maxwell's story with his kids that I interviewed on the show, how his kids bought
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:06.220]   their houses debt free by the time they were in their 20s. If possible, I'd love to, in
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:11.300]   addition to that, be able to give my kids a house. So do something like help them to
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:14.580]   live in one and rent the other, something like that.
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:18.940]   Now that's just a dream. I don't know if it'll happen. A lot will depend on what actually
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:24.400]   happens over the next 15 years. A lot of things could change. But if I could train my children
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:29.080]   and help them to develop their character so that they would be able to handle a large
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:34.460]   gift of money or a large gift of property, I think that would be ideal.
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:39.740]   For me, I'm very attracted to the idea of real estate because I can use it for multiple
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:46.380]   benefits. And specifically with regard to kids, I can use it to teach them about investing.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:50.700]   And I also like the fact that it's a lot of hard work. And so this would give me an opportunity
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:55.180]   to put my children to work in a tangible, real, meaningful way.
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:59.020]   The problem with using stock analysis as a basis of teaching about investing, and I plan
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:04.300]   to do that a little bit, but the problems that I see with that is it's tough to do effectively,
[01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:11.860]   especially in the public markets. It's very intellectual and it's not tangible. So if
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:17.300]   I have an eight-year-old, how many eight-year-olds are going to want to sit down and be intrigued
[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:21.180]   by the sticker prices of stocks? Now, if I do have an eight-year-old who seems inclined
[01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:25.860]   in that direction, then I'm open to doing that. But that seems rare to me. Warren Buffett
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:30.460]   was that way, but I ain't Buffett and I'd be surprised if my kids were either.
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:33.620]   But we could do something like drive around and look at houses together. And then I can
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:38.020]   have them research market values and we can look through and try to run a spreadsheet
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:41.900]   and see what would be the rents be. And they can get on the phone and call around for rental
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:46.260]   rates and we can go to the closing together and then we can go and mow the lawns together.
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:50.660]   And so that gives me an opportunity to teach them and train them through productive, meaningful
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:55.140]   work. And I really like that aspect of the need for work. We can go and we can paint
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:59.420]   together and that builds the opportunity for us to be together, but also for them to have
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:06.140]   an outlet for energy and to be able to see the direct monetary impact of work.
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:11.140]   So my hope would be that if I can train those skills, that those skills would go with them
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:18.420]   throughout their life. I'd set aside, I don't know, $150,000 in cash reserves for
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:23.300]   the household. That'd be several years of living expenses in case of disaster. I'd
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:29.140]   put $50,000 in cash and stick $100,000, maybe some life insurance policies or something
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:35.900]   like that. I'd buy $150,000 of something like gold coins and store them abroad in case
[01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.500]   they're ever needed to start my life over again in a different place. And that would
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:45.100]   use up somewhere around $2 million-ish of the money. And that would provide for my first
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:49.420]   responsibility which is the living needs of my family.
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:54.500]   Now, the reason I'm answering in this segmented way is because of the idea of the windfall.
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:58.100]   This is my plan as far as I'm doing it, but right now the two and I'm about to go
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:03.560]   over the $8 million now, they're all integrated. And so I'm just working my way down the
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:09.220]   next goals. But in my mind, if I came into that amount of cash, the $2 million would
[01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:12.580]   take care of my needs to provide for my family and kind of make that financial independence
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:14.380]   plan with excess.
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:22.540]   Now, that leaves me with say $8 million-ish to work with for investing and massive growth.
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:28.780]   And I feel a responsibility for all of the $10 million to grow it and multiply it. But
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:35.960]   in my mind, I would mentally kind of segregate it and focus on investing the $8 million.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:40.320]   My first investment would be in radical personal finance. And I did do some things that I've
[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:44.480]   not done because I bootstrapped it. I would hire some staff to help me with the business
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:50.160]   and I would immediately delegate a lot of the busy work that I've currently been doing.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:53.280]   I bootstrapped the thing so far and I've done most of the work myself with a little
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.080]   bit of help here and there.
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:59.640]   The challenge is that I'm not spending all of my time in the areas where I'm best in
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:03.800]   the world. Rather, I'm spending some of my time where I'm best in the world and
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:08.600]   sometimes in – some of the time in other areas. So ultimately, over time, I need to
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:12.440]   transition to spending all of my time at what I'm best in the world at and hire everything
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.760]   else done.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:17.040]   But the challenge for an entrepreneur, especially one who's bootstrapping their business,
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:23.200]   is when do I do that? And I've made the mistake of – in past businesses of doing
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:28.400]   it too soon, just kind of being committed to the philosophy without actually practically
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.240]   looking at my situation and saying, "Well, I'm going to go ahead and do it here."
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:36.800]   And I may be making the mistake of doing it too late right now. I don't know. I'll
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:38.760]   look back and know in the future.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:42.040]   But if I had that kind of windfall, I'd make some quick changes and I'd bring in
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:44.920]   a little bit of help. I don't need much. I'd hire some marketing help, a little
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.160]   bit of help on the website. I'd hire some stuff done like transcribing shows that has
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:55.040]   a high cost and I think it has a low return, but it might have some marginal impact. I'd
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:58.080]   probably hire some professional writing help to help me with some projects.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:03.840]   But for me, Radical Personal Finance is a tremendously important project. It's a business,
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:11.080]   but it's also something that's impactful. I use the word "calling." I know it can
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:15.780]   make an impact. I get the emails that prove to me that it makes an impact. But it also
[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:21.480]   can make a very healthy profit. I haven't done a hugely perfect job of maximizing profit,
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.760]   but I am committed to doing so and changes on that coming in the future.
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:29.600]   But I would probably pull back on the amount of content that I create. So far, I've
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:36.000]   made a tactical decision to make one of my unique selling propositions the sheer amount
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:41.800]   and depth of content that I create. But if I were all of a sudden charged with – and
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.520]   that's a good decision at this point in my life because one of my major assets is
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:49.800]   this business. But if all of a sudden I were charged with managing the $8 million, I'd
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:53.960]   have a ton of work – or the $10 million total. I'd have a ton of work to do to effectively
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:58.880]   invest that money and to effectively grow it, effectively give it, etc. I would need
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.920]   to have a major upgrade of my skills.
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:08.640]   I would transition radical personal finance probably away from the CFP-type conversations
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:13.800]   that I often have and into a deeper level business podcast. Now, that might be a tactical
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:19.320]   mistake in terms of the audience size, but it would be a strategic decision because it
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:23.620]   would help me to develop my skills of business oversight and supervision, which are skills
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:27.200]   that I need to develop. I'm actually going there with my content in the future. It's
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.360]   part of the strategic plan. You just haven't seen it on the show yet.
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:37.120]   Next, I would focus on investing in private businesses and enterprises that systematically
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:43.960]   invest in and help people. You'll notice so far in one of my investments a conspicuous
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:51.280]   absence of publicly traded securities. That's a bit unusual for a former stockbroker. I'm
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.440]   not committed to not investing in stocks. I'm still willing to do it even though at
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:01.360]   the moment I haven't currently done it. But the thing I've realized is that only a few
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:09.680]   of my goals are effectively accomplished through investing in large publicly traded companies.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:16.480]   That's not to say that your goals are not effectively served. Simply that my goals are
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:23.320]   not as effectively served with that course of investing as other courses of investing.
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:28.000]   Here would be an example to illustrate. Let's say that I find a good publicly traded company
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.480]   that I want to invest in. Let's just say Coca-Cola for example. I don't really have any beef
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:37.840]   with Coca-Cola. I could probably find something to have a beef with them if I try, but I don't
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:45.120]   want to try. I prefer not to have too many battles going on at any one time. So I buy
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:53.400]   some shares of Coca-Cola stock. Well run company, blue chip. What do I get in exchange for owning
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:58:02.080]   my shares of Coca-Cola Corporation? Well, I get dividends and potential stock growth.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:07.280]   At my current scale of net worth or even with a scale of net worth of $8 million, what impact
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:18.560]   would I have on Coca-Cola? None at all. Zero impact. So the money has one single benefit.
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:23.060]   I get a little bit of growth and a few dollars of dividends per share. What does that do
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:29.500]   for me? Well, it enriches me a little bit and allows me to have other people running
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:36.960]   a company that I own and paying me money. So let's say I see a homeless guy or a homeless
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:40.320]   gal on the side of the street. Well, I'm getting off of I-95. What can I do to help
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:46.400]   them in that situation? Well, basically I can toss them a few bucks. Does that help?
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:54.360]   Eh, maybe. I would say big maybe. But flip it around and let's say that instead of purchasing
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:59:01.520]   shares of Coca-Cola stock, I have a rental house. Well, now I can offer that homeless
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:09.840]   guy or gal a day's work with a lawnmower chopping down weeds. I can feed them a good
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:13.280]   lunch and make sure they're well-fed. I can pay them well for their work and I can
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:18.500]   give them the opportunity to earn their wages with dignity instead of begging on the side
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:23.120]   of the street. I can get involved in their life a little bit. I can learn about them
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:31.480]   as a person and maybe I have additional opportunities that will be able to help them with more work.
[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:38.760]   Then, I might be able to give them some but at least then I've offered the opportunity
[01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:46.560]   for them to work. And their work will help me. It will help my profit on my house and
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:52.200]   my investment. But it gives me an additional benefit of being able to provide work to help
[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:58.280]   them. Now, of course, these aren't exactly apples to apples. Of course, I could offer
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:03.240]   to that homeless guy or gal to come and paint my house, my personal house and I could still
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:09.480]   invest in Coca-Cola stock. But my point is that if I have opportunities of business using
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:15.600]   rental – a rental house as a mini little business that requires work, then I can have
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:21.080]   an impact on my community. Now, remember of course that that comes with a trade-off. If
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:26.560]   my goal were simply to pack up my stuff and go sail the world for a few years, then perhaps
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:32.080]   the publicly traded stocks are the better move. They're less work, less hassle, greater
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:38.720]   safety, things like that. If I can just put all my money in Coca-Cola stock and spend
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:42.880]   my dividends, those dividends will spend in every port in the world. I don't have to
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:48.720]   worry about my house burning down or a thief breaking in or a tenant falling through the
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.680]   floor or any of that stuff. But those aren't necessarily my goals for my life, at least
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:58.880]   not right now. They may be for yours. So for me, what I'm looking for is multiple benefits
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:05.480]   from my investments, not just money. I'm looking to – to use the permaculture phrase
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:15.740]   – stack my functions. I would have to make a very serious and diligent study of opportunities,
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:20.920]   business opportunities where capital is the constraining factor to business and investment
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:28.040]   entry. This is a very important point. If I had an $8 million portfolio to invest, I
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:33.080]   would have a very different approach to my investing than I currently do in my current
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:37.680]   lifestyle. Right now at the beginning phase of my life, I don't have a lot of financial
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:43.440]   capital. So I'm looking for investment opportunities where sweat equity is valuable.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:49.000]   Example, what does radical personal finance cost? A couple thousand bucks of equipment,
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.320]   a few hundred bucks a month of fees, of hosting fees and things like that, and thousands of
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:02:04.000]   hours of hard work. But what's the return on investment? Well, right now with nothing
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:11.140]   more than the Patreon campaign, I have about $1,900 a month of gross revenue into radical
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:16.160]   personal finance. That's just Patreon. That's going to change. That number has been remarkably
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:20.000]   stable. Now let's say I pull off $400 a month of
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.560]   direct costs of running the show and also the Patreon fees that they pull out of your
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:29.440]   contributions. Let's just say that I net $1,500 per month. Let's say that's stable
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:37.560]   and it doesn't grow. $1,500 a month times 12 equals $18,000 per year of profit from
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:43.640]   a business that has been a huge amount of work on my part but not really that big of
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:49.400]   a financial outlay. Compare that to say Coca-Cola. What's their
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:54.400]   dividend yield right now? Like 3%-ish or McDonald's, what, 3.5%? You can fact check me on that
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:03:00.400]   stuff, but I should be pretty close. If I were going to create $18,000 of annual profit
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:07.920]   from a 3% dividend rate stock, I would need a portfolio of $600,000 of capital. Take $18,000
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:14.720]   divided by .03 and you wind up with a number of $600,000 of capital. That's a bunch of
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.640]   money. But if I had a $600,000 portfolio of Coca-Cola stock, that's about what I would
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:28.240]   net as far as dividends, 3% annual profit. So in this way of thinking, of comparison,
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:37.240]   I've invested a year of my life and built a $600,000 asset. So even though my actual
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:42.960]   earned income for the past year of my life has been quite low, the payoff from my time
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:51.560]   on paper, at least in my own mental order of priority, is pretty massive.
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:56.920]   Now they're not truly comparable because the Coca-Cola dividend would actually be passive
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:02.360]   and radical personal finance is the exact opposite of passive income. I spent a lot
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:07.160]   of time working on it and that's what you're paying for. But the point I'm bringing here
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:14.600]   is I'm focusing on where the constraint on investment is not a financial constraint,
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:19.760]   but rather a skill constraint and a quality of product constraint and a time constraint.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:24.280]   At this stage of my life, I have a little bit of financial capital to invest and my
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:31.520]   investment goal is location independent income and to be earned in a way of a lifestyle that
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:37.140]   I enjoy. I have a lot of human capital that I can invest. So I've chosen a business that
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:42.060]   has a very low barrier to entry on the financial capital side, but a high barrier of entry
[02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:47.560]   on the human capital side. Starting a podcast is easy and cheap in financial terms. You
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:50.920]   can do it with your phone. You don't even need anything else. I can do the whole thing
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:59.920]   with an iPhone. But creating a great podcast is hard and expensive in human capital terms.
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:06.120]   So I've chosen the market where I believe I can compete the most effectively and I'm
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:12.120]   doing the best I can and I'm growing and I'm learning and I'm competing semi-effectively
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:18.520]   because I have lots of competitors, but I can make up with human skill, my background,
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:23.120]   my knowledge and developing my abilities, I can compensate.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:27.380]   Now if I had an investment portfolio of $8 million, that would be a very different equation
[02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:33.320]   because now I have money to invest and I would need to massively adjust the scale of my investments
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:40.560]   to be appropriate to my net worth. It's tough to invest $8 million into a podcast.
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:43.840]   Where on earth would you spend the money? I don't know. Maybe I could invest $10,000
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:49.720]   or $20,000 effectively. Maybe more if I started hiring full-time staff, but frankly, I don't
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:56.100]   have a clue where I would spend $100,000 effectively in this business and get any meaningful rate
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:06:01.040]   of return. The constraint is not financial capital.
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:06.320]   But there are a bunch of markets that I would need to pivot to where I would be looking
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:13.800]   at investing and I would have an advantage based upon the financial capital. On that
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:18.600]   basis, I would be an accredited investor. So that means a bunch of the rest of the people
[02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:22.680]   are locked out because they're not accredited investors. So some of the juicy investments
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:26.480]   are set up for me. That's how the accredited investor system works.
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:32.120]   In some ways, I would actually be a big gun in some markets, but I would have an ideal
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:35.940]   scenario because I don't have the flip side. I don't have Warren Buffett's problem of figuring
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:43.760]   out where on earth do I invest a billion dollars. That's tough. That's why his returns are steadily
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:49.240]   decreasing and he says it explicitly. How do you invest billions and billions of dollars?
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:56.120]   It's hard. So I would just need to find and figure out where could I put $8 million to
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:01.920]   work in an area where my own personal strengths give me a competitive advantage and where
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:08.400]   I can get the maximum return on investment both in financial benefit and other lifestyle
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:13.680]   benefits. Frankly, I'm not sure what that is. I'm not there. So I haven't spent a lot
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:18.960]   of time thinking about it for myself. If you're there, you need to think about it.
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:23.360]   The challenge is that when I was a financial advisor, the automatic answer was, well, mutual
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:27.680]   funds. The investors that you work with as a financial advisor, at least the type of
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:32.120]   structure that I was in, are looking for mutual funds or looking for stocks or something like
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:36.680]   that. But you reach a point and there's a difference in investment perspective. If you've
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:40.760]   got the $8 million, you've probably spent a lot of time thinking about this.
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:44.680]   So for me, I don't know. I might buy a McDonald's franchise. I might buy a hotel. I might buy
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:49.700]   a bunch of farmland. I might become a real estate developer. I might buy and run a grass-fed
[02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:53.760]   cattle ranch. I might develop an eco-village somewhere in the world. I might build some
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:58.440]   of my sustainable, cheap housing ideas. I might start a coffee shop or a restaurant.
[02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:02.480]   I don't know. When I'm there, I'll let you know what I'm doing. But I really don't know.
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:05.800]   But I would take it very seriously and I'd look for the markets where I can invest with
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:10.160]   a competitive edge and I could meet multiple goals. I want a unique and lasting competitive
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:15.260]   advantage. I want a business that is morally upright and honorable. That business must
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:21.280]   bring value to society. It must not be a leech on society. I want control of the enterprise.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.960]   I have such oddball priorities compared to many people. It is very difficult for me to
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:28.920]   consider how I'd have a business partner with the same priorities. So I would need control
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:33.240]   of the enterprise. I want a business that serves people and improves the communities
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:37.080]   where it's located. My highest priority is people, which I'll come to in a moment.
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:40.240]   I want a business that I'm excited to be involved with. I want to be on the cutting edge of
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:44.520]   something. I want to be proud of the impact that my companies make on the world, whatever
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:49.320]   that company is and whatever those impacts are. For me, this is a big deal because the
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:53.600]   number one thing that leads to entrepreneurial and business success is the amount of time
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:09:02.160]   spent selling. I can't sell something I'm not excited about. So I've got to be proud
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:04.520]   and excited of it.
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:11.700]   Overall, the major theme of my business and investing pursuits both now and in the future
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:18.440]   is this. I want to invest in people. As a Christian, I'm instructed, which is why I
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:22.920]   spent so much time on the worldview, as a Christian, I'm instructed to not worry about
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:30.480]   the treasures of this world, but rather to worry about the treasures in the next world.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:33.560]   Jesus commanded his disciples in this way. He said, "Don't store up treasures here on
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:38.760]   earth where moths eat them and rust destroys them and where thieves break in and steal.
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.840]   Store your treasures in heaven where moths and rust cannot destroy and thieves do not
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:49.760]   break in and steal. Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:50.760]   be."
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:56.920]   So the question is, how do you actually do that? There are a few ways, but today I'm
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:00.160]   just going to share with you the way that is most meaningful to me right now, and I'd
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:05.040]   encourage you to study and think out some of the other ways. But in this context, the
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:12.360]   number one way to store your treasures in heaven is to invest in people's lives. What's
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:20.040]   the same between heaven and earth and what's different? Well, there are many things that
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:24.520]   are different, but what's the same is, among others things, but two things just that are
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.980]   specific to this discussion, what's the same between heaven and earth is the presence of
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:35.680]   God and the presence of people. God is in both places and people are in both places,
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:43.760]   whole people. So as a Christian, my focus is on serving, helping, ministering to, and
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:49.260]   loving people. In the Bible, there's a story about when the religious teachers of the law
[02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:54.760]   at that time were testing Jesus, they were testing him on his interpretation and understanding
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:59.100]   of law. There's a version of this story in the book of Mark and there's a different version
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:03.400]   in the book of Luke. They're slightly different, but they have a common theme. And the religious
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:08.520]   teachers asked Jesus, they said, "What's the most important commandment?" Or in the
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:12.680]   version in Luke, the man asks, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus responds,
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:17.640]   he says, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:26.360]   mind, and with all your strength, and love your neighbor as yourself." Love the Lord
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:29.320]   your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:34.280]   strength, and love your neighbor as yourself. And I believe that's how we invest in people.
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:38.360]   If we love God with all our heart, all our soul, all our mind, and all our strength,
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:42.200]   it will lead us to care about what he cares about and to act on it. And what does God
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:48.560]   care about? The kingdom of God. What makes up that kingdom? People. You don't have to
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:54.200]   wait for $10 million to invest in people. I'll share with you, you know what the height
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:12:00.360]   of religious expression is for me, one of the holiest things I do? Washing the dishes.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:06.160]   It's one of the most spiritual things I can do. Why? Because it's one way of loving my
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:13.920]   life. What does it cost me? Time and focus. You know what another one of the most holy
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:19.240]   things I do is as a Christian? Going to work to provide for my family. It's the zenith
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:27.840]   of spirituality. I believe you store up treasures in heaven by loving and caring for people.
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:32.040]   That starts with your spouse and continues with your children. I forgot to mention this
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:36.160]   earlier, but I think one of the things that we would do if we had a $10 million windfall
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:41.360]   is we'd probably adopt some children. I'm so burdened by the situation facing children
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:45.560]   in our society. I feel like we're living in a veritable holocaust, but it's hidden from
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:52.080]   day to day life. If you look at the numbers, Hitler killed perhaps 6 million Jews, or if
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:58.360]   you include the additional 5 million non-Jewish victims of his work, you find a total of 11
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:04.640]   million people-ish died. In the United States alone, we kill over a million babies a year.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:12.240]   Since 1973, in the US alone, we've killed over 53 million babies. On a global basis,
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:20.760]   the conservative estimates are about 40 million babies per year. I don't know about you, but
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:25.120]   that burdens me so much because I often wonder what would I have done if I were living in
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:31.800]   Austria or Germany 75 years ago? Would I have cared enough about people to do something
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:40.920]   about the murder being committed every day? Would I have just gone along in quiet comfort,
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:49.240]   living my life and grandly pleasing myself without a care in the world? I often ask myself
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:55.960]   this question. I say, "Can a person who opposes abortion ethically do so if they're not willing
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:14:04.600]   to invite the unwanted baby into their home?" My wife and I talk about that. So far, we
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:08.440]   haven't sensed that the time is right for us to do that just because of the strain that
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:12.280]   it would bring in our family at the moment, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were in
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:15.760]   the future. The challenge with adoption is that it's a major financial commitment up
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:21.400]   front based upon the way that our society handles it. It's different from having your
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:26.200]   own babies biologically, so it requires a very different type of financial planning,
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:31.000]   but it's also a financial commitment ongoing. Especially as your family grows, it brings
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:37.400]   additional expenses to support your spouse. So there's a major financial component to
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:42.480]   it. Anyway, I got off track. My point is investing in people, it starts with your spouse. It
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:47.800]   continues with your children. It continues with investing in your closest neighbor, whoever
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:53.160]   that is, and then proceeds from there to society at large and across the globe. It goes through
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:57.440]   whatever doors are open to you. Now, there are many other ways to store up
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:00.560]   treasures in heaven. I'm just sharing what is meaningful to me at the moment. For you,
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:10.040]   it may be different, but that's one of the major themes. Those are some of the ideas
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:13.000]   that I have about what I would do with the money.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.760]   Now, I've ignored a bunch of important topics. This show is already a beast, already very
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:20.160]   long, and some of you will astutely observe that I've actually completely skipped talking
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:24.200]   about giving, which is one of the most important things to consider and frankly is the place
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:29.120]   to start with all money. Although sometimes I use the phrasing of the concept of pay yourself
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:33.000]   first, I really don't like it because I think that giving should always be done first. I
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.440]   like to think of the concept of pay yourself second after you give, but I've avoided the
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:40.400]   discussion here partly because I have some unorthodox views on it, which I don't want
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:44.040]   to go into today, and partly because I wouldn't have any idea of how to actually give away
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:49.040]   a million dollars well or two million dollars well. I don't know. We'll discuss that sometime
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:52.840]   in the future, but giving money away well is a tough thing to do. So just for now, consider
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:58.960]   it rolled up into investing. For me, investing doesn't all have to do with a financial return.
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:02.880]   But these are my answers. It's the best answer that I have for the question of what I would
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:08.200]   do if I won the lottery. But in thinking about the question for a few weeks now in preparation
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:12.040]   for this show, I've come to the conclusion that it really wouldn't change much in my
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:18.160]   life. It would just bring a ton of responsibility that frankly I'm not sure that I'm ready for.
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:23.800]   I mean, certain aspects would be fine. I'd like to have an RV and if I won the lottery,
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:29.440]   I'd probably buy a big fancy diesel coach instead of the more modest used class C RV
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:33.280]   that I'd otherwise choose. I don't know. But I still think I'll wind up getting the
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:36.760]   RV at some point because it'll serve a purpose in my family and it'll serve a need at a
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:42.360]   time. I might trot right out and buy those paddleboards quicker if I won the lottery,
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:45.880]   but I don't really need them. I mean, I've sat on them for four years just kind of watching
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:50.160]   and waiting for a deal. My son isn't old enough to care about paddleboards. We just sit and
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:56.400]   play in the lagoon at this point. That's more fun for him than being on the surfboard.
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:59.400]   The beginning I started with saying I've been blessed with a great life already. I truly
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:06.520]   have. I've enjoyed some incredible peak experiences. I've traveled the world and dined on the best
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:11.200]   food that money can buy and had some of the most incredible experiences. I've seen some
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:18.600]   of the wonders of the world. I've been so fortunate. And I dare say that you have too.
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.640]   If you haven't, you can have all those things without the need to win the lottery. Although
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:30.000]   thinking about the lottery is a useful mental exercise to understand what the inner desires
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.080]   of your heart are, don't put your hopes or your dreams on winning the lottery. It might
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:39.560]   bless you and give you an opportunity to bless others, but it'll also bring a tremendous
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.920]   burden and responsibility into your life and it could even destroy your life if you aren't
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:48.640]   careful. We live in one of the most incredible times of human history. Think about this.
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:55.000]   You can get onto an airplane and in a few hours be on a different continent. Imagine
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.920]   that. Every single one of you could take a European vacation this summer if you wanted
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:05.880]   to. It's a few hundred bucks for a plane ticket. I don't know, $800 depending on where you're
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:12.600]   going. You could go see the Duomo and the Pantheon and the Parthenon and the Sistine
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:18.040]   Chapel and David and the Eiffel Tower and the Tower of London. If you saved for a few
[02:18:18.040 --> 02:18:23.920]   months and focused on it, every single one of you listening could do it. Think about
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:29.720]   how luxuriously you and I already live. Every single one of us can have the best bed that
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:34.760]   money could buy, the most beautiful bedroom, the most beautiful living room, the most beautiful
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:39.120]   kitchen that money can have. All it takes is a comfortable mattress and the right linens
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:44.400]   and a few coats of paint and some well-lit artwork. If you won the lottery, would you
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:49.280]   really buy a 15-bedroom mansion? How many bedrooms do you need? You can only sleep in
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:57.600]   one at a time. Think about how luxurious your transportation already is. I just bought a
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:03.880]   $500 car and that car is an absolute marvel. It's a 1998 Toyota Corolla. It takes me down
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:12.760]   the road at 70 miles an hour in padded, air-conditioned comfort. It's smooth. It's quiet. It's comfortable.
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.520]   I can drive over 30 miles on a single gallon of fuel and I can spend my time in the car
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:23.440]   listening to discussions with the smartest people in the world for free through a podcast.
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:25.280]   How amazing is that?
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:29.760]   Now most of you have cars that are a bit fancier than that. I have a fancier car too and I'll
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:35.040]   probably have fancier cars in the future. But does it really make that big of a difference?
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:39.680]   I've driven my share of $100,000 cars. Unless you're at the track, you can hardly get things
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:45.800]   out of third gear before you're stuck behind some – I don't know, some other – someone
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:46.800]   else.
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:51.080]   What about your food? All of us have enough to eat. Most of us have more than we need.
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:56.240]   You can have the best food in the world, every single one of you and me. If it's a few
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:00.080]   hundred dollars to do so, just cancel your cable bill for a few months and schedule the
[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:08.480]   fancy dinner at Chateau – whatever. Chateau Jean-Paul. I don't know what the fancy names
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:11.680]   are. But frankly, it's not that much. I have a brother of mine – and you don't
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:14.320]   even have to spend that much to get great food. I have a brother of mine who's a foodie
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:19.800]   and he laughs at me. But I really enjoy silly cheap things like pot stickers from TGI Fridays
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:24.980]   or a barbecue sandwich from Sonny's. Now I like the foodie stuff as well.
[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:27.660]   Recently a new friend of mine who's listened to the show invited us over for dinner and
[02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:32.720]   served us this amazing pineapple bacon guacamole and homemade prosciutto as an appetizer. It
[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:37.440]   was incredible, total foodie and totally delicious. You can learn to make that with a few minutes
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:40.240]   of free instruction on YouTube. Isn't that incredible?
[02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:43.940]   What about wine? One of my favorites, believe it or not, is a box of Merlot from the Total
[02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:48.400]   Wine and More that I walk to from my house. That box of wine has four bottles in it and
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:54.440]   I can get it on sale for $12 a box. That's $3 a bottle and it's really, really good.
[02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:59.880]   Is it the best in the world? I'm sure it's not. But who defines best? Once you get free
[02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:03.280]   of the need to impress people by how much money you spend, you can just simply drink
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:08.540]   what you like. And the limit of my appreciation is usually defined by my palate, not by my
[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:15.460]   pocketbook. Now those are all consumption items, but they don't cost much. They bring
[02:21:15.460 --> 02:21:24.720]   a little bit of joy, but not the most joy. And how many people do you know that have
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:34.040]   all of those things and more and don't have peace? That don't really seem to get joy from
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:45.080]   those things? You know what brings the most joy? Peace with God changes everything. And
[02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:53.920]   giving and serving and loving. How much does it cost you to sit down and have a cup of
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:22:00.520]   tea with your spouse every night? Try it. Turn the TV off and put the kids to bed and
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:08.360]   just sit and talk. Just work to understand her. And I say her because usually we as husbands
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:18.800]   are the worst with this. Just try to understand your spouse, him or her, and love them. How
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:24.080]   much does it cost to arrange to meet your friends at the park and play a game of ultimate
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:30.580]   Frisbee together, and yet how fun is it? How much does it cost to volunteer your time and
[02:22:30.580 --> 02:22:36.600]   your talents to help someone move or to help your neighbor put up their Christmas lights
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:47.080]   or to start a community garden or to adopt a child or open an orphanage? I have zero
[02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:52.160]   desire to be Bill Gates. Can you imagine the difficulties that man faces every day? Again,
[02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:55.320]   he has to figure out how to effectively give away billions of dollars. He has to worry
[02:22:55.320 --> 02:23:00.000]   about his kids getting kidnapped. Most important, he has to figure out how to keep his kids
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.320]   grounded from a young age. So pray for him when you think of it. He's got a tremendous
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:11.960]   responsibility. But the things of consumption are not meaningful in the long run. And some
[02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:18.480]   of the most important things and valuable things we do are wrapped up in serving. And
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:24.880]   serving costs little to no money but has profound benefits.
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:27.920]   The interesting thing is that the psychologists have proven the value of this again and again
[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:33.040]   and again. So you can do what I do, which is simply follow what was written down thousands
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:37.040]   of years ago and has been proved again and again and again and again and again and again
[02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:41.660]   as being true, called the Bible, or you can go and read the latest psychological research
[02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:49.360]   and integrate that. That's good too. But recognize that the deeper, more valuable things
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:57.240]   of life are generally not what is advertised on TV or what is caught up in the insert of
[02:23:57.240 --> 02:24:04.840]   a fashion magazine. Don't worry too much about winning the lottery. Worry about developing
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:09.960]   the skills and the character and the capacity to be able to handle that much money and not
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:17.320]   let it destroy your life. That way, you'll win either way.
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:22.080]   The purpose of becoming financially independent is not necessarily so that you are financially
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:27.920]   independent, although I'm looking forward to that day myself, but rather so that you
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:34.520]   can become the kind of person who is financially independent. And once you've achieved that
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:41.520]   character, financial independence will just be the starting place. If you have the capacity
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:47.480]   and the skills and the character to handle the money, then you'll be able to handle it
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:53.480]   without destroying your life. If you don't have that, then the money that you have is
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:25:00.800]   probably destroying your life and the other money is going to destroy your life too. Focus
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:07.080]   on winning either way. How? Well, in the words of a famous theologian named John Wesley,
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:12.400]   "Earn all you can, give all you can, save all you can." Although I don't think that's
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:20.980]   a perfectly accurate statement, I think it's probably the pithiest statement. Certainly,
[02:25:20.980 --> 02:25:29.600]   he wraps up more truth in 16 words than – excuse me, 12 words than I can in a couple hours,
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:32.160]   but I hope this has been useful.
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:36.320]   Hope this show has been useful to you. I know there's a lot here and I know my way of answering
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:40.600]   these questions goes against the grain of how many people would approach it, but when
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:46.480]   you see life as integrated as I do, you can't disconnect the answers. Your life goals will
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:52.800]   inform your investing strategy and your perspective on money will inform the rest of your life.
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:57.640]   I actually explicitly or specifically ignore the second part of the question from Mike
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.440]   about the specifics of how to take the payments and etc. because the annoyingly consistent
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:06.240]   answer from me would be, "Well, it depends. It depends on your goals." I don't play
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:09.220]   the lottery so I wouldn't have those options, but I've shared with you what I would do
[02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:13.400]   and for me, I would take the lump sum because I would want to have control over it to invest
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:18.600]   it the way that I do if I won the lottery, but I don't. So the lump sum would be – that
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:19.800]   was why I went at all that whole thing.
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:23.080]   But if I had a client approach me for financial advice, the first thing we would do would
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:26.440]   be to have a discussion about their goals, their values, their worldview, what they're
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:32.000]   trying to accomplish and if their goals were consumption, then my advice would be, "Well,
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.320]   you better take the payments and not the lump sum because that way you'll be able to assure
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:44.320]   your income to fund your lifestyle without going broke." But if their goals were different,
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:50.360]   then the answer would be different and you've got to work through and sort through what
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:53.840]   the goals are, what the worldview is and then you'll clearly be able at that point in
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:59.440]   time to be able to see how to apply it.
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:04.000]   So I hope this has been helpful to you. I thank you so much for listening. I thank each
