[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   Many people think meditation is about changing the contents of consciousness.
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.600]   There's some contents you want to get rid of, like anxiety,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.800]   other contents you want to encourage, like calm and unconditional love,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.100]   or some other classically pleasant pro-social emotion.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.560]   And that's all fine, that's all possible.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.280]   But the real wisdom of, you know, the 2,000-year-old wisdom of meditation
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.780]   that really is the, you know, the chewy center of the tootsie pop,
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.240]   is a recognition of what consciousness itself is always already like,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.460]   regardless of the contents and the changes in contents.
