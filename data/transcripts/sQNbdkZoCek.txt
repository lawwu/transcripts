[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   If you've been thinking about planning the perfect getaway to Mexico,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.400]   or maybe you haven't but now you're intrigued,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.320]   you're going to love this video because we've got Zach Rabinor,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.920]   founder of Journey Mexico,

[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.400]   unforgettable experiences in one of

[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.760]   We'll cover all the main places you already know,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.680]   as well as places you didn't even know you wanted to go.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.360]   The best times to travel,
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.760]   ways to get around the country,
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.320]   some hidden gems, must-try eats, and so much more.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.120]   Then after, I'll cover some tips and
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.520]   tricks for getting the best deals on your trip.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.160]   If you're convinced to visit Mexico by the end of this episode,

[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.280]   All right, let's get into it.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.200]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.320]   Zach, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.480]   It's great to be here. Thanks for having me.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.200]   I think Mexico is a very different travel destination
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.400]   than all the ones we've done before,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.480]   which are all have you cross an ocean.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.000]   I was thinking about how I would
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.720]   describe an itinerary to a foreign country.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.520]   Often it's thinking, "Oh,
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.240]   I'm going to go to this place for
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.460]   two weeks and try to fit the whole country in."
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.040]   Mexico feels so close to home for people living in the US and
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.320]   Canada that you might approach it differently.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.440]   I think I'll just start by kicking off.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.160]   How do you think people should be thinking about
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.360]   Mexico as a travel destination,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.720]   given that we might all have a lot of different preconceived notions?
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.120]   Sure. Well, you hit it on the head.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.960]   We see a real dichotomy in the way that people travel through Mexico.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960]   The longer haul origin markets.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.560]   If you're coming from the UK or Europe or further afield,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.920]   you'd come for at least two weeks and often three or four weeks,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.960]   and you'd treat it as a once-in-a-lifetime trip.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.120]   You'd travel all over.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.320]   You'd go from north to south.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.760]   You'd visit the cultural centers, the beaches,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.960]   and all the diversity that Mexico has,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.020]   or at least as much of it as you can fit in in the time you have.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.920]   For North Americans and Mexicans as well,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.640]   Mexico is a repeat destination.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.960]   It's really close.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.840]   It's a really unique destination in that it's close to home,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.360]   it's familiar, but it's exotic.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.720]   You've got a different language,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.920]   you've got different customs,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.120]   you've got different cultures, different history,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.920]   especially for North Americans.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.480]   Yes, you often would travel for a long weekend or a week,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.680]   a week max, and you would come back.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.080]   Perhaps one type of trip would be sun and sand,
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.720]   the beach, get out of the cold.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.800]   The winters are long in North America.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.640]   We do see incredible correlations of spikes in bookings.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.440]   When those first cold fronts come and the first snowfalls come,
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.060]   and all of a sudden, boom, we see bookings spike.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.960]   But then there's also the cultural side of Mexico.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.760]   Mexico City has been so popular recently,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.000]   San Miguel de Allende, Oaxaca,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.880]   the Yucatan Peninsula, Merida, there's a lot.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.680]   I think there's two decidedly different ways to travel in
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680]   Mexico for the closer to
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.440]   home trips in North Americans and Mexicans as well,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.820]   which would be either your typical sun and sand type of trip,
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.120]   or your more cultural trip.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.600]   Yes, Mexico certainly is
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.280]   a repeat destination that people come back to over and over again.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.340]   You mentioned a lot of places.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.840]   Is there a way, you just broke it up pretty easily into two.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.600]   How do you think within there about even trying to process all of these options?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.800]   I imagine someone on the East Coast is probably like,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.220]   well, I've probably been to Cancun,
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.240]   and someone on the West Coast is like,
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.480]   I've been to Cabo and maybe been to Mexico City or Puerto Vallarta.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.200]   But there's so much more.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.720]   How do you start to break it down for someone who's like,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   I have a week, I want to think about it. What should I do?
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.400]   Sure. Well, absolutely.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.640]   People are very interested,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.500]   especially when it's a short haul trip.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.040]   They want direct flights.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.360]   You start looking at flight access and you ask people to really try.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.640]   Don't tell me where you want to go.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.440]   Tell me what you envision.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.520]   What do you want to do?
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.760]   What hat do you have on?
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.320]   Do you have your beach lounging hat and escape the cold hat?
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.720]   Do you have your culinary hat on?
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.560]   Do you have your history and culture and art hat on?
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.880]   Really listen to someone about what it is they want to do,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.040]   and then try to direct them towards or at least explain
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.240]   the different options and what there is to do,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.820]   and what type of experiences there are in different destinations.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.340]   Are there a few places,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.360]   you mentioned the big list, but it stand out as,
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.760]   in your mind, you're like, I don't know why these places don't get the visits,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.440]   the credit that some of these other more popular places get,
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.720]   but they probably should.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.220]   My mission with Journey Mexico was to share the beyond the beach destinations.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.600]   It's interesting, through the pandemic,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.440]   we've seen a lot more focus on a lot of the more cultural,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.120]   more off the beaten path,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.800]   more remote destinations.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.380]   But I always wondered why people had never been to Mexico City,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.080]   or people had never been to Oaxaca,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.440]   people hadn't been to Chiapas or the Yucatan Peninsula,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.800]   like Merida, the Haciendas, Campeche.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.400]   These are all incredibly culturally historically rich destinations
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.960]   that people often hadn't heard about.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.360]   During the pandemic, when people couldn't go and get their Italy fix,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.880]   or their safari fix,
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.720]   or their Far East fix,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.560]   or Middle East, or these more exotic destinations,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.760]   people really started exploring Mexico in ways they hadn't before.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.680]   That was a great silver lining,
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.920]   if you will, of the pandemic,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.800]   is that Mexico saw a lot of people in destinations that they hadn't seen before.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.120]   What is it about Mexico?
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.200]   I mean, you started an entire company dedicated to the country.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.560]   What about Mexico do you think is so special?
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.760]   I had worked as a tour leader and a guide.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.640]   This was on the back of just exploring,
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.520]   and backpacking, and being a mountaineer, and a surfer.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.200]   As I led people through these destinations,
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.400]   I was fascinated and I covered all of Latin America.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.880]   I was leading tours to Mexico, Central America, South America.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.480]   When in particular, Mexico blew me away,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.320]   because I too had the stereotypes,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   and had traveled to Club Med as a child with my family.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.600]   All of a sudden, we were in these incredible UNESCO World Heritage Cities.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.480]   The architecture, the food,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.760]   the culture, the history, the archeological sites,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.480]   the people, it really blew me away.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.360]   That's where the light bulb went off,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   and I said, "This is an untapped resource.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   This is a treasure." That was the inspiration.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.320]   I'm a treasure that for the majority of people listening to
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.760]   this show is much cheaper and
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.240]   easier to get to than a lot of other places in the world.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.120]   You make such a good point there,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.960]   and that's so interesting that I said it before,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.920]   it's close enough and familiar enough,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.480]   but exotic enough and far away enough.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.960]   That's right. It's got so many compelling reasons to visit,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.400]   not the least of which is the proximity, the value.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   When I say value, I'm not saying it's a cheap destination.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.720]   Everyone who's been to Mexico recently,
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.520]   especially will attest to the fact that it's not the cheapest destination,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.840]   although the whole world seems to be a little wacky in terms of prices these days.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   But the service you get,
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.120]   apples to apples, pound for pound Mexico,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.560]   especially when you look at the competitive set in sun and sand terms.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.480]   Often people are considering a beach holiday over Christmas or New Year's to,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   well, I'm either going to Hawaii,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.040]   Mexico, or the Caribbean.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.160]   That's the competitive set.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.660]   Not only the value you get in terms of the quality of the hotel or the experiences,
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.080]   but the service.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.200]   I think that's where really the difference is stark,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.600]   is Mexico is such a hospitable country.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.600]   The culture is so hospitable.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   Mexican culture is so warm.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.920]   It takes two seconds before someone's inviting you into their home,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.200]   inviting you for a drink, a meal.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.520]   A very common expression is,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.920]   "Estás en tu casa.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.240]   Mi casa es tu casa.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.920]   My house is your house."
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.660]   I think that that's where it just really goes off the chart in terms of value.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.220]   You're getting better product,
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.700]   you're getting more for your money,
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.220]   and you're getting far superior service than you would get in almost anywhere in the world.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.380]   For someone who just heard that expression,
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.460]   the idea of getting invited to someone's home,
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.500]   to me that seems a little foreign,
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.060]   having been focused most of my trips to Mexico,
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:54.880]   maybe more like your childhood where it's Cabo or Cancun at a resort with family.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.600]   Is that something that you think people visiting might actually
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.160]   experience if they just got off that standard track?
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.680]   Because it feels a little foreign to think about it.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.680]   Absolutely. That's, again,
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.600]   part of our mission is I can't encourage people enough to get out of the hotel,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.360]   to go and visit archaeological sites,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.180]   to visit local people,
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.600]   to interact with the locals.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.740]   Even if that means having a local guide or it's not always that easy,
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.940]   especially if you're not fluent in Spanish or you don't
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.340]   have someone who you know or friends in the country.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.300]   But that said, I think, yes,
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.300]   getting out of the hotel, opening your eyes,
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.060]   even speaking to the taxi drivers or your transfer driver or the people in a store,
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:47.460]   you'll really find an incredible warmth and you'll find invitations do flow freely.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:53.600]   Do you think Spanish becomes more necessary the further away you get?
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.400]   How much of the country's ability to speak English is focused just
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.480]   on hospitality and major tourist destinations?
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.280]   Sure. Tourism is a tremendous and important revenue generator for Mexico.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.240]   Obviously, that's another part, by the way,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.600]   of the services. Mexico has had
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.760]   real professional level tourism and travel for 70, 80 years now.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.320]   It's well ahead of a lot of Latin America in terms of
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.600]   the development and the maturity of its tourism market.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.480]   You really do have incredible human infrastructure.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.000]   The people are well-trained, they're professional.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.880]   They're second, third, fourth generation hospitality professionals.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.040]   You will find a lot of English.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.680]   However, you get off the beaten path and I mean,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.400]   even in Cancun or Los Cabos or Puerto Vallarta,
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   you step into a convenience store and the clerks are not speaking English.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.680]   Spanish is an incredibly valuable tool.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.160]   I can't stress enough,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.720]   whether it's Mexico or wherever you may travel,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.040]   how valuable and how important it can be to know even just a few words.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.400]   Of course, more is better.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   But yeah, certainly for me,
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.800]   what led me into the tourism field was my travels and then my fascination with
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:20.320]   the culture and then a real focus and a real passion for learning Spanish language.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.720]   I ended up getting a master's degree in international affairs and being able to
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.400]   penetrate and get into the culture and be able to
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.600]   converse and interact with people in their own language.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.640]   That's a whole nother level of interchange and of sharing that you can do.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.520]   Yeah. For anyone who didn't check out,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.760]   we did an episode recently with Benny Lewis who runs Fluent in
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.000]   three months and we talked a ton about both becoming fluent,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.320]   but also just like crash-coursing yourself in
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.600]   a language in a short period of time and effective ways to do that.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.920]   If someone listening is thinking,
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.560]   "Gosh, I took Spanish in school.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.800]   I need to brush up."
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.880]   There's some good tips in that episode to go back and check out.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.640]   I want to jump into a few regions, but before that,
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.800]   talk generally about getting around.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.040]   You mentioned people target places with direct flights.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.440]   What's it like to actually get around outside of
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.840]   the main hubs in Mexico when it comes to transportation?
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.440]   There's all kinds of transportation to the most remote places in Mexico,
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.280]   from very modern buses.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.200]   Of course, you've got taxis.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.040]   You've got even some trains like in the Copper Canyon and some other areas.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.840]   But yeah, you've got internal flights that you
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.000]   can hub and spoke at a Mexico City or Guadalajara or Monterrey.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.080]   But all kinds of very good and constant transportation.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.480]   Very frequent running, regularly running.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.120]   You've got ferries, you've got boats,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.160]   you've got all kinds of stuff.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.000]   Remember, the large majority of the population does not have a car.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.960]   They are using public transportation.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.760]   Then you can rent vehicles,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.600]   you can contract vehicles.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.640]   Our company organizes transportation, of course,
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.960]   but there's loads of ways to use public transportation,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.720]   and it's very effective, efficient, and cheap.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.880]   When it comes to timing throughout the year,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.760]   are there times to avoid or times to you think Mexico really shines?
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.800]   I know Caribbean has rainy season.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.440]   How would you tell someone to think about when to plan a trip?
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.560]   I imagine there will be people that end this episode and think,
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.480]   I've always thought of Mexico in one way,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.840]   I now think of it in a new way,
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.680]   and I'm ready to go experience that.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.360]   When should they be thinking about it?
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.920]   Yeah. I think anybody who has
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.000]   true flexibility and freedom with when they travel,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.120]   should target non-peak periods.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:52.920]   I mean, that's obvious, right?
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   That's a no-brainer if you can.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.560]   The peak periods are going to be the most crowded,
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.440]   they're going to be the most expensive,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.680]   they're going to be a hassle in general.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.280]   Then you look at rainy season,
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.720]   when's the weather best?
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.520]   You've got, in general,
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.120]   rainy and dry season throughout all of Mexico.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.520]   The rainy season spans from about June through October,
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.400]   with the worst of it being late August into late October.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.000]   You probably want to avoid that.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.080]   But even the rainy season,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.720]   the early parts of the rainy season,
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.160]   June, July, even early August,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.280]   we look at it as the green season.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.000]   It's lower prices.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.920]   I think that's a travel hack, if you will,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.280]   is getting there.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.000]   What most people think is rainy season,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   but it only has a little bit of thundershowers
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.840]   in the late afternoon.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.440]   But generally, you've got nice weather
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.960]   and much better prices,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   less people, more availability,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.200]   and that goes for everything, right?
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.960]   It's not just the hotels,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.440]   it's guides, it's in the archeological sites,
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   the restaurants, Mexico City restaurants,
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.880]   seeing everybody's after these iconic restaurants.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.640]   So yeah, I would say those are great months.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.560]   Also, I love November.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.960]   November's a great month,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.560]   outside of Thanksgiving week,
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.840]   which is kind of a peak little week there.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.640]   But otherwise, all the way into early December,
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.440]   before the Christmas rush,
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.040]   you can find great values and the same deal.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.360]   You've got good weather,
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.120]   you've got great availability,
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.200]   you can get into the restaurants,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.240]   traffic is more mellow.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.880]   And then you really have to go destination by destination.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.320]   We've seen a real uptick in travel to Mexico City
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.080]   over Christmas and New Year's.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.160]   In the beginning, people thought,
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.560]   well, I don't really want to visit
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.720]   because a lot of Mexico City shuts down.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.200]   But that also means you don't have
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.480]   the crazy chaotic traffic, right?
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.520]   And you can get around, it's more mellow.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.720]   Sure, I mean, maybe one or two restaurants
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.440]   or clothes that you wanted to go to are an attraction,
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.720]   but the calmer pace in a very chaotic city
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.240]   is a big attraction, very attractive to people.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.560]   And then I think, yeah,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.160]   I think that those are some good
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.640]   kind of insider tips on when.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.400]   - Yeah, we did a trip as a,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.760]   well, we planned a trip as a family
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.720]   to Mexico City over Christmas.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.280]   And for whatever reason, everyone in our family bailed.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.440]   And so my wife and I just went, the two of us.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.880]   And I would say, I give my full endorsement
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.760]   to that time of year.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.840]   We didn't have a problem,
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.680]   like restaurants might've been closed a day or two,
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.920]   but it wasn't impossible to get incredible meals.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.040]   So I think for people who probably haven't been
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.760]   to Mexico City or really left,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.240]   you know, major tourist hotels and stuff,
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.120]   how would you describe Mexican food?
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.680]   Because I feel like there's American Mexican food,
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.120]   there's Tex-Mex, and when you're truly in Mexico
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.800]   and experiencing everything, how different is it?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.280]   - Sure, that's a great question.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.720]   And there's not an easy answer to that
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.800]   because Mexico, like the US, is a vast country.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.000]   It's really big and cuisine is very regionalized.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.120]   So the food you get in Baja, California is very different
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.600]   than the food you're gonna find in the Yucatan.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.720]   There are some commonalities, right?
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.720]   You've got the staple ingredients of corn,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.320]   chili peppers, tomatoes, lime,
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.360]   that you can find ubiquitously, it's everywhere.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.560]   But the way, the preparation,
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.920]   you've got regional specialties,
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.080]   you know, the tlayudas of Oaxaca,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.000]   you've got panuchos in the Southeast, in the Yucatan.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.680]   Mexico City's famous for its tacos.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.440]   You've got a special way of preparing fish and shrimp
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.680]   in Baja, California.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.000]   So, you know, I always say having a bad meal
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.200]   is a sin in Mexico because the food is so good.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.320]   You really, you know, it's like having a bad meal in Italy.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.080]   Like, you've really gotta have bad luck
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.040]   or, you know, really screw it up.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.240]   But Mexico, the cuisine is so good.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.200]   We were the third country in the world
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.920]   after France and Italy to be declared
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.760]   a UNESCO World Heritage Site for our gastronomy,
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:01.320]   for our cuisine, and that's an intangible heritage
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.480]   of Mexico, and you can read more about that.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.680]   But so interesting.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.000]   The food is just amazing.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.520]   It's one of the most visible,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.720]   the most obvious things that I miss
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.600]   when I'm traveling out of Mexico is just heavenly.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.280]   It's amazing.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.080]   - If you were just randomly transplanted
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.880]   to a city in Mexico and you had to find
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.000]   the best restaurant with no knowledge,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.800]   is there, are there ways to get that information?
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.400]   I feel like asking someone, especially as a foreigner,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.360]   can often lead to, well, let me take you to this place
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.840]   that maybe I'd make some money for sending you to.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.680]   How would you suggest people find great places to eat?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.120]   - Well, first of all, absolutely, what you said is true.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.640]   I think it's important to kind of slow people down
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.800]   and really ask them, no, don't tell me where I should eat.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.760]   Where do you eat?
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.760]   You know, where do you go when you have day off
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.280]   and you're gonna take the family for a nice big lunch?
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.800]   And by the way, that's another important thing
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.160]   to keep in mind.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.640]   Mexico, the important meal is the lunch.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.000]   It's not dinner like we do in North America, right?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.680]   So where do you take your family for lunch?
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.960]   And also be specific, like we like seafood
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.080]   or we'd like tacos or we'd like certain types of meal.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   You know, what's your preference
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.760]   in terms of different foods?
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.760]   But yeah, kind of urging people, you know,
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.240]   stop your stock answer or where you might make a commission,
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.960]   but where do you go?
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.160]   Where do you go for the best taco or the best lunch spot
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.640]   or the best seafood or whatever it is
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.400]   that you have a hankering for?
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.100]   - And is there any website or app that Mexicans are using
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.720]   to rate and review places that might be helpful?
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.560]   - That's interesting.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.320]   I never thought of that because it's so ubiquitous in the US
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.400]   and in the rest of the world.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.520]   It's not as common because it's all word of mouth.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.160]   We have restaurant guides that we put out
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.340]   and so you can find them on our website.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.000]   But yeah, I think that asking locals
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.160]   and this is really interesting, you know,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.080]   as the world becomes more commoditized
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.800]   and as you've got AI,
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.400]   you've got access to so much information,
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   getting those recommendations from people you really trust
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.040]   and you feel like you share the same taste with,
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.520]   that's real gold and getting those recommendations.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.480]   And not just, you know,
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.000]   what's the most famous restaurant in Mexico City,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.240]   but the little hole in the wall places,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.060]   the under the radar places,
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.680]   the places and also the places that are still good, right?
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.320]   It was not just that it was good yesterday,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.680]   but is it still good today, right?
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.640]   That's the type of local knowledge that's really valuable.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.720]   - And in general,
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.080]   to kind of logistics from a timing
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.720]   and reservation perspective,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.280]   how should people think about going out to eat?
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.800]   - Listen, if you go to Mexico City,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.360]   you gotta get on that.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.960]   If you're interested in the iconic,
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.400]   super sought after reservations,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.040]   you should be making your restaurant reservations
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.600]   when you made your hotel reservations,
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.420]   even if that's months out.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.840]   Otherwise, it's really difficult to get a bad meal.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.280]   I mean, there's so much good food.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.400]   I don't think you have to worry much,
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.800]   but if you do want the kind of,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.320]   there are no Michelin star rated restaurants in Mexico,
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.460]   which is laughable to me.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.600]   But if you want the iconic best of the best in Mexico City,
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.640]   or even in Oaxaca or perhaps Merida,
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.280]   it's good to make those reservations early,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.240]   especially in Mexico City.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.720]   - Timing wise, what time do people eat dinner?
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.540]   And I feel like I've gone and I don't remember,
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.440]   but is there a hack to, you know,
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.080]   if you want to get into some of these places,
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.520]   go a little earlier, go a little late?
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.840]   - For sure, for sure.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.440]   Mexico City and Mexico in general,
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.420]   dinner is typically not eaten before eight o'clock at night
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.760]   and often as late as 10.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.480]   Lunch doesn't begin until two
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.000]   and can often be eaten as late as four.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.100]   So it's very much in the Spanish tradition.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.240]   You've got the siesta,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.740]   people often leave for lunch and don't come back.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.480]   Yeah, so it's a much later cycle.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.880]   So a good hack is eating earlier.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.000]   - Absolutely, if you're okay with eating dinner at 6 p.m.,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.520]   as long as the place is open,
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.580]   you know, you may have to wait for them
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.140]   to get the grill fired up.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.260]   But yeah, that's a good way to go about it.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.840]   - You know, I keep thinking back to that recommendation
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.160]   you gave in Puerto Vallarta,
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.800]   that I'm like, I'm literally gonna go there for dinner.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.720]   And so I'm gonna push back a little,
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.080]   since I know you put together a few things in advance,
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.420]   maybe give people a couple places,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.600]   even just one in a few areas that are like that,
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.360]   that would just really top off a trip
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.560]   in the kind of food, drink, kind of cafe area.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.180]   - It's so vast, right?
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.320]   But there are these gems that really stand out to me,
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.960]   and it's so rich,
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.780]   and there's such a range of different type of things.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.560]   But Mexico City in particular,
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.960]   you know, the street food and the tacos,
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.120]   and it all changes, right?
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.000]   So we definitely, before you go, check back in with me,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.160]   need to make sure that it's still performing
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.440]   and still putting out the goods.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.260]   But El Venadito, which is Carnitas in San Angel,
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.240]   you eat, you literally eat standing up outside,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.960]   but it's the best Carnitas tacos you'll ever have.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   Carnitas are fried pork and pork rinds.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.880]   Also the Tacos Moran, which is the suadero,
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.280]   that's in San Miguel, Chapultepec.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.200]   Those are two amazing taquerias.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.980]   I was also thinking about in Oaxaca,
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.840]   this little trendy place that we just went to,
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.520]   Levadura de Olla, check that out.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.360]   And then a really local place is called La Teca,
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.760]   you know, really locals only, kind of hole in the wall,
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.060]   but just delicious.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.700]   I mean, I actually dream about the mole that I had there.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.800]   And there are places like this all over, you know,
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.520]   Merida, Riviera Maya, you know,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.020]   you were talking about Cancun.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.360]   How do you find, right outside of Playa del Carmen,
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.480]   there's a place called Cocos Cabañas,
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.600]   about seven miles north of Playa del Carmen.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   It's owned by this Swiss-Mexican couple.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.320]   And our operations manager, our groups manager,
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.560]   who lives in Playa, she's Swiss,
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.880]   so she probably has an affinity
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.200]   for this Swiss-Mexican combo, but just beautiful.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.840]   A mixture of like European and Mexican.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.920]   There's just, everywhere you go,
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.200]   there's such a plethora of amazing places
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.560]   from high cuisine to kind of street foods,
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.400]   you know, stand up and eat tacos on the street.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.660]   And I, interestingly, that's the trend lately is,
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.320]   you know, people want to eat at Pujol,
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.560]   which is Enrique Olvera, Mexico's most celebrated chef,
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.420]   Michelin star, if Mexico had Michelin stars.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.280]   And the next day they want to eat tacos on the street,
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.480]   like standing up and dripping taco juice on their shoes.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.920]   So, you know, let me know when you go
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.500]   and we'll fill you in on all the little details,
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.920]   but there's so much and it's always changing.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.040]   It's a moving target.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.080]   It's so much fun keeping on top of it.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.280]   - I haven't had lunch yet,
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.080]   so I am very excited to eat just in general,
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.960]   but even more excited for the next trip.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.360]   So what I think would be helpful,
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.880]   you kind of divide it into two broad regions,
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.800]   the kind of vacation, sun, beach,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   and kind of more heritage.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   And I don't know if Mexico City falls in heritage
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.160]   or a third category on its own,
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.220]   but let's pick those three.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.680]   Let's start in kind of beach and relaxation
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.440]   and maybe hit on kind of some of the favorites
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.580]   and the highlights from your perspective,
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.540]   where people wanting that kind of trip should look,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.620]   both if it's a place that they've heard of,
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.620]   but still worth going.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.120]   But, you know, I think I'm hoping to maybe hear
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.040]   of a place I've not considered for that experience.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.000]   - Sure, so there's kind of the big three these days,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.320]   at least for international tourists,
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.840]   which are Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta,
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.440]   couple that with Punta de Mita,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.280]   and Cancun, Riviera Maya, all the way down to Tulum, right?
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.640]   Those are the three big beach destinations.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.120]   Acapulco used to be in that category,
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.400]   and it's since fell out of favor,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.760]   at least internationally, big destination
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.540]   for people from Mexico City and within Mexico.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.320]   But there are more off the beaten path destinations.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.920]   And I think that's very much in high demand these days.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.360]   People wanna know what's the next Tulum, right?
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.760]   So you've got places like Sayulita,
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.080]   you've got Puerto Escondido on the Pacific Coast.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.360]   I think quite a bit of the Pacific Coast
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.640]   is still relatively unexplored.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.480]   You've got Ixtapacihuatanejo, which is lesser visited,
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.520]   still more popular than these kind of
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.440]   very little fishing towns.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.400]   At Todos Santos in Southern Baja is another place
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.720]   that people are keen on, you know,
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   looking for off the beaten path, smaller beach destinations.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.440]   Even going further than Tulum, down to Bacalar,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.320]   which is down all the way towards Chetumal,
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.240]   that's another interesting spot
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.160]   that's just starting to be noticed.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.640]   Those are a few of the lesser visited, Sun and Sand.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.120]   - In the, how would you compare the three more visited?
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.200]   For someone's like, I'm going to Mexico, I wanna beach.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   It's funny, 'cause I've been to all three,
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.720]   and I don't know if I have the right answer.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.920]   So if someone asked me, I'm hoping I now have a place
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.600]   to send them to kind of compare.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.680]   - In broad strokes, you've got the Caribbean,
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.080]   which is this turquoise water, this fine white sand.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.200]   You know, if you're a snorkeler, a scuba diver,
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.000]   this is heaven.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.080]   That said, it's also the most visited, right?
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.960]   So the Cancun Airport gets flights from,
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.800]   well, it did get flights from Moscow,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.160]   not quite so much anymore.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.760]   But you know, from very, very far flung
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.000]   international destinations.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.760]   Got thousands of flights landing and taking off daily.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.400]   And it's crowded, it's busy, it's commercial.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.280]   So you really have to dig there, right?
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.480]   Get out of Cancun, used to be Playa del Carmen.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.880]   Now Playa del Carmen is full.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.800]   You go down to Tulum.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.840]   Tulum seems to be a bit overcooked at this point as well.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.560]   So you've really got to kind of dig
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.960]   and find little off the beaten path places
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.520]   to find any kind of peace and quiet
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.680]   or more relaxed atmosphere.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.200]   Quick question, where does Cozumel fit in there?
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.720]   My wife went as a child every year
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.040]   and neither one of us had been there in a decade
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.000]   and you didn't mention it.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.360]   So I thought I'd just ask.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.520]   - Cozumel is a big dive spot
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.560]   and it's also a huge cruise port.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:42.040]   So that is what dominates Cozumel travel and tourism.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.800]   I don't know if your wife's family were divers.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.360]   - They were going for diving every year.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.600]   - There you go, yep.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   Yeah, and then you've got Isla Mujeres.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.240]   You've got a bunch of little different Puerto Morelos.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:57.400]   There's little spots that you can try and hit.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.160]   So it's important to dig a little further.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.800]   Then you've got Puerto Vallarta.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.240]   I would say Puerto Vallarta
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.120]   is probably the most traditional beach destination.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.480]   That's where I've lived for the last 16 years.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.560]   It had, there's a colonial historical center.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.800]   It had a life and an economic life
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.880]   and historical life before tourism and travel came.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.840]   Tourism and travel came back in the fifties.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.200]   If you remember Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton film,
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.440]   "The Night of the Iguana" there.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.960]   So it's been on the radar.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.920]   It kind of was a jet setty type of destination
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.400]   back when Acapulco had fame and was shiny
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   and it still really retains a lot of local charm.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.840]   One of the things that I love about Puerto Vallarta
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.560]   is the initial waves of travelers and tourists
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.080]   that came and even settled there
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.480]   were largely North Americans, also some Europeans
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.600]   that came to live like Mexicans.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   You know, they put on their huaraches,
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.880]   their traditional sandals and got their little bag
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.240]   and went to the market and they were very respectful
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.840]   and created a very symbiotic type of relationship
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.760]   with the local people.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.000]   So that in turn created a very kind, generous,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.320]   open-hearted outlook from the locals towards the tourists
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.520]   and towards the settlers, right?
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.680]   And we found that as a family living in Puerto Vallarta.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:27.080]   Cancun, on the other hand, really was an invention, right?
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.520]   It was a business operation.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.200]   They saw the potential.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.640]   They came in, Fonatur, and created Cancun
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.440]   with the sole purpose of bringing travelers there.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.640]   And it was literally wetlands and mangroves
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.280]   and there was no community there, right?
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.080]   So everything is imported, including even the locals.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.480]   There's no real locals.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.360]   There's a few local fishing and it was more migrant, right?
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.840]   Seasonal fishing.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.280]   So you feel that difference very starkly.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.240]   You've got traditional architecture
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.440]   and it reflects in the food as well.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.640]   When we talk later about
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.320]   the more cultural heritage destinations,
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.080]   you'll hear me talk a bit about, you know,
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.280]   people often ask me to compare San Miguel Allende and Oaxaca
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.960]   and not to detour too far off what we're talking about,
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.400]   but wherever you have more tradition...
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.080]   So Oaxaca has a lot of indigenous,
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.640]   pre-Columbian culture, history, people.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.560]   And so that influences the food and the culture
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.600]   and the history and the clothing
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.240]   and the language and everything.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.360]   It's the same way with Puerto Vallarta.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.760]   You've got more of a historical...
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.120]   You have more roots there.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.640]   And that shows through in the food and the architecture
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.680]   and the history and the culture.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.960]   And also the sense of pride that the local people have
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.720]   about their own hometown.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.760]   So that's Puerto Vallarta.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.840]   Los Cabos is really the new kid on the block.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.840]   You know, the Baja Peninsula was considered
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.520]   literally an island for a long time before...
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.840]   Yeah, we're talking historically, right?
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.920]   Back in the 16 and 1700s,
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.440]   before people realized it was connected
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.880]   all the way up at the border with...
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   Well, I guess it was still part of Mexico,
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   all of the Southwest of the United States.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.680]   But in that sense, it's very removed.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.760]   It's very expensive, Baja,
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.200]   because of the same reasons, right?
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.120]   You have to import everything.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.200]   A lot of the products and even the history
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.920]   and the culture comes from North America,
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.480]   not from the mainland of Mexico.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.960]   But Los Cabos, yeah, it's new and glitzy
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.160]   and shiny and fancy and definitely more expensive.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.320]   But it's also got a very, very high level
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.240]   in terms of quality, of service, of...
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.600]   And many people say that it really does feel
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.000]   almost like an extension of Southern California.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And, you know, you had Baja California, Baja Sur,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   and this was just lower California.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.800]   And you still feel a lot of North American influence there.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.040]   I'd also add to that, just geographically,
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.800]   it's this very stark desert
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.760]   contrasted by this sparkling, dazzling Sea of Cortez
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.800]   and the Pacific Ocean.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.880]   So that juxtaposition of the desert
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.600]   with this deep blue Pacific
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.720]   and the sparkling, dazzling blue Sea of Cortez.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.240]   And the Sea of Cortez in itself is worth mentioning.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.840]   This is what Jacques Cousteau called the world's aquarium.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.280]   So this is like a Galapagos level
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.120]   marine wildlife environment.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.960]   So there's a lot there.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.560]   - Before we move on from beach,
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   I wanna think there's probably, I guess,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.160]   some high percentage of the audience
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.320]   who's going to, in the next year or two,
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.240]   go to one of these three destinations.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.680]   If we cycle through each of them,
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.280]   what's one or two things people should consider adding on,
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.000]   whether it's for the day or a couple of nights
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.520]   that's nearby to kind of enrich a trip
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.880]   to Riviera Maya, Los Cabos, or Puerto Vallarta?
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.720]   - Sure, I mean, it's a bit of a can of worms here.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.080]   There's a lot, you know, but if I could generalize,
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.760]   I'd say, you know, make sure,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.480]   even if you're in an all-inclusive hotel,
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.760]   which offer great value, and I'm not down on that,
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.600]   but get out of the hotel.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.880]   Get out there.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.000]   You know, there's some must-see type of things.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.200]   If you're going to the Riviera Maya or the Caribbean,
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.480]   you're probably gonna have to see an archeological site
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.320]   if you haven't been,
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.480]   whether it's Chichen Itza or Tulum or Coba.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.960]   But, you know, interact with your driver, with your guide.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.320]   Stop into a local restaurant.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.440]   Try to mix it up with the locals a little bit.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.560]   So I'd say, in general, get out of the hotel.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.240]   Try to interact with the locals.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.120]   Go have a local meal at a local restaurant.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.400]   Often, taxi drivers are a great source,
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.000]   and remember to ask them to go to somewhere they would go,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.260]   not someplace that they want to take you to.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.200]   Tell them that you'll even pay their commission.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.520]   You'd be happy to pay for their honest tip
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.800]   and their honest recommendation,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.200]   and not just someplace they might get a kickback.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.880]   - Yeah, I'd also say, look around,
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.440]   and of course, we're a resource,
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.200]   but look around on the internet
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.800]   or with friends or other resources.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.120]   What are some small towns around where they're staying
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.600]   that they might be able to go in
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.160]   and have a beer at sunset or meet the locals
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.680]   or something that wasn't so built up?
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.240]   You know, if you can find a little small town
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.880]   to go have a coffee or a meal or a drink,
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.040]   that's a great opportunity to kind of feel
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.200]   a little bit more of the authentic nature of a destination.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.060]   - I'll push a little bit on each one,
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.880]   maybe one at a time, just to get a couple specific things.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.680]   So someone's going Riviera Maya.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.880]   Let's say they're in Cancun.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.160]   Maybe give 'em a couple things,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.080]   whether it's a restaurant, a bar, or a day trip
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.760]   that would kind of just elevate the trip
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.680]   that they might've otherwise taken
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.960]   and stayed at the, in my case, since I've done this,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.440]   stayed at the JW Marriott for a while.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.800]   That was 10 years ago.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.440]   - If you're going to the Riviera Maya or the Caribbean,
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.920]   I'd say definitely, you know, go and find,
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.680]   go visit Puerto Morelos, for example,
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.560]   and just kick around the town and go down to the beach
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.400]   and get a ceviche and yeah,
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.880]   you should try to find that small town feel.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.800]   You know, it used to be Tulum.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.000]   Tulum is now, as I mentioned, kind of a bit overcooked.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.080]   It's still cool, it's still bohemian chic,
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.220]   but yeah, it's gotten quite crowded and busy.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.480]   So, go to Puerto Morelos,
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.760]   or if you want something totally away from the sea,
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.200]   go over to Valladolid,
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.440]   which was the first capital of the Yucatan Peninsula.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.120]   That's to the west of Cancun,
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.600]   colonial town in the middle of the peninsula.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.440]   You could actually combine it with a trip to Chichen Itza
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.600]   and just walk around and feel that colonial history
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.320]   that really you don't get
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.760]   if you just stay at the beach resorts.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.800]   So, that would be the Caribbean.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.620]   If you go to Puerto Vallarta--
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.580]   - Which by the way, we are going,
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.720]   my family and I are going the first week of December.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.540]   So, have plans, looking to add something on.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.260]   So, this one-- - To Puerto Vallarta.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.020]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.740]   Well, I'd ask you if you'd been before,
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.860]   but I'd say take a trip over to Sayulita,
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.940]   which is a little town north of Punto de Mita.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.220]   You could also go and get tacos in Pitial,
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.520]   which is a little local part of Puerto Vallarta City.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:29.260]   Walk the Malecon, which is the seaside promenade at sunset,
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.820]   along with all the other Mexican families and their kids.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.460]   I could go on and on.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.620]   There's some amazing beach clubs
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.580]   in the south side of the bay, Majahuitas,
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.780]   or there's a whole string of them.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.260]   Casamaraycas that are amazing.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.260]   I think you have to get out on the water in Puerto Vallarta
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.500]   and see that perspective with the mountains
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.980]   and the whole Bay of Banderas.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.560]   So, those are a few things that you might consider
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.620]   in Puerto Vallarta.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.060]   And in Los Cabos, I might encourage you
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.140]   to go one way or the other up the coast,
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.060]   either to Todos Santos, which is on the Pacific side,
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.220]   amazing little colonial village, an oasis town,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.620]   a lot of artists, an expat surfer vibe,
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.860]   great little restaurants as well.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.540]   You go for a surfing lesson in Los Cerritos Beach.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.500]   So, that could be one way.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.980]   Or, go the other side of the peninsula,
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.380]   which would be up towards Cabo Pulmo.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:25.020]   Cabo Pulmo is home to the northern most tropical reef
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.380]   in North America.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.060]   And you can do some incredible snorkeling
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:35.060]   with giant fish balls of mahi and of whitefish.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:40.580]   And yeah, I think that that's a world-class experience.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.460]   And also, there's some great little cevicherias
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.140]   and marisquerias right there,
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.660]   little seafood restaurants in Cabo Pulmo.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.260]   So again, get out of the main town, get in a car,
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.820]   go take a drive, open your eyes,
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.140]   meet some locals, eat some good food.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.780]   I think that's a good formula for Mexico
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.820]   of getting a bit more of a feel.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.860]   - I feel like I'm gonna be a little embarrassed to say this,
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.820]   but I'm gonna do it anyways
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.360]   for the sake of everyone listening.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.020]   So, I've probably been to Los Cabos, I don't know,
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:12.060]   plenty of times, like for many times for a bachelor party,
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.300]   'cause from California, it's the easy option.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.060]   And we've never spent any time in San Jose del Cabo.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.060]   Is that a huge mistake?
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.820]   - I like San Jose del Cabo.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.800]   And again, there is a village there.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.120]   There is a town there that was there before tourism.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.460]   You've got colonial architecture, you've got some shops.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.740]   So, I absolutely think it's worth a visit,
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:33.860]   especially, you're right there.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.900]   It's not a big investment of time.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.660]   Go check it out, for sure.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.060]   - Okay, and then before, last, last thing,
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.100]   before I move outside of the beach is,
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.780]   since I actually am going to Puerto Vallarta,
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.900]   is there a couple, like, we're going with kids,
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.180]   so keep that in mind.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.460]   Maybe we could escape them for a day also.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.620]   But is there a place that my wife and I,
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:58.760]   if we leave for a day or an hour or two to get a meal,
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.420]   we should be checking out specifically?
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.620]   Since this one, at least for me, is like,
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.440]   yep, I'm gonna go book it, we're gonna go do it.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.820]   I'll report back to the listeners.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:06.900]   - Here's an even better one.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.260]   You can bring the kids,
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.340]   go to a little restaurant called Barracuda.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.540]   And they have a couple locations.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.540]   They're buddies of mine.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.660]   And the one in the center of Puerto Vallarta,
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.980]   so it's Barracuda Centro.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.220]   The reason I say bring the kids,
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.240]   so you've got this beachside restaurant
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.380]   that has wonderful seafood, amazing view,
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.700]   but it's right there on the sand,
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.160]   and the kids can run around on the beach.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.860]   So they go and, you know, they'll eat their food,
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.620]   and then they can run right out there.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.820]   It's safe, you can see them,
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.040]   and you guys can hang out and have a margarita,
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.220]   and you can even get tables right on the sand there.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.180]   So that could be one.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.220]   Now, if you really wanna leave 'em behind,
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.120]   and you got a little more than a couple hours,
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.420]   there's this amazing restaurant called The Ocean Grill.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.260]   You've gotta go over to Boca de Tomatlan,
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.580]   or you can actually leave from downtown Vallarta.
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.120]   You get a water taxi, and you gotta make a reservation.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.620]   They only go by reservations.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.940]   And it's this incredible setting
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.060]   where you're nestled into this cliff
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.580]   on the south side of the bay.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.360]   They don't allow kids.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.220]   And it's just really simple, fresh seafood.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.060]   It's a grill.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.020]   They throw on the grill either fish, octopus,
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.220]   lobster, shrimp.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.820]   I think they make a little bit of meat as well.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.600]   And it's really a special experience,
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.100]   and kind of a time travel, if you will.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.900]   You know, you feel like you've gone back in time,
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.520]   and you're in this little tropical paradise
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.440]   with the jungle all around you, and the sparkling sea.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.680]   And you can even, there's this cool little area you can,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.000]   if you like to jump off of stuff,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.120]   you can jump off into the ocean, and it's awesome.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.240]   - I do, I feel like nice dinner,
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.400]   jumping in the water is an activity
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.280]   I am interested in.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.840]   My wife would be like, no, I did my hair
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.680]   for this nice dinner, and we left the kids at home.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.000]   I'm not jumping off.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.120]   But we are bringing our au pair,
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.380]   who's never been to Mexico, and she's so excited,
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.000]   which means that we will be able to sneak away
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.240]   for at least one evening.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.140]   So I'm adding that to the docket.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.640]   We will make that reservation.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.880]   Okay, I wanted to go a little deeper
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.920]   on the new things to try while you're in those places,
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.340]   'cause I imagine most people maybe don't do that normally.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.840]   But a lot of these other destinations,
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.560]   more heritage-focused cities are things
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.200]   that I know a lot of people haven't checked out in Mexico.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.440]   So how would you break down those options?
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.760]   I don't know if you wanna start or end with Mexico City,
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.600]   but you let me know.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.600]   - Sure, so Mexico City definitely fits
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.860]   in the whole heritage, culture, history category.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.520]   I think you gotta start and finish with Mexico City.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.040]   Mexico is a very centralized country, right?
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.200]   Everything begins and ends in Mexico City.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.080]   It's a very centralized place in terms of politics,
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.840]   economy, culture, and yeah,
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.520]   it is such a fascinating, dynamic city.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.960]   I believe that everybody who likes cities
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.880]   and enjoys traveling in cities should go.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.200]   You've got culture, you've got history,
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.960]   you've got music, you've got cuisine,
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.540]   you've got incredible museums.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.480]   The hotel scene is amazing, the bar scene.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.820]   You could spend a long time in Mexico City.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.460]   You've got some of the, you know,
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.520]   not only is it the most important place
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.960]   in modern-day Mexico, but this is where the Mixtec,
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.840]   actually, not the Mixtec, sorry, the Mexica,
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.400]   which Mexico is named after, they came to Mexico City,
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.000]   they saw an eagle with a snake in its claw on a rock
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.080]   and said, "This is where we're forming our capital."
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.080]   That was Tenochtitlan.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.080]   That's ancient capital of the Mexica.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.920]   And so it's been the most important capital city
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.140]   of Mexico from the very beginning, right?
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.240]   We're talking about thousands of years ago.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.580]   So yeah, I couldn't recommend it highly enough,
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.620]   and you definitely need inside knowledge
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.460]   to kind of make the most of your time.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.740]   You need a minimum, minimum, minimum,
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.740]   of four days in Mexico City,
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.660]   but I think you can easily fill up a week or two,
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.260]   depending on your interests.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.520]   Just doing the highlights takes four days,
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.740]   and those are the top-level highlights.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.000]   And then if you want to kind of get under the skin a bit
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.960]   and go a little deeper and explore,
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.760]   you need at least a week.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.000]   - Okay, so I'm very curious to see
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.440]   what we may have missed or not missed.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.520]   We went for, I think, five days.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.040]   I'll second everything you said.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.320]   I think for someone in the States
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.700]   looking for an international city to go on an adventure to,
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.200]   I can't think of a better place.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.440]   Like, easy to get to on flights, super affordable,
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.600]   incredible hotels, food, drink, everything.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.160]   So let's talk about some of these highlights,
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.640]   because if someone listening hasn't been to Mexico City,
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.960]   I think it just has to be on the list.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.520]   - And by the way, one other thing I'd mention
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.920]   about Mexico City is one of the greatest thing
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.080]   about not just Mexico City, Mexico in general,
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.200]   are the Mexicans.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.920]   I mean, the most hospitable, warm, dynamic people,
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.360]   but also in Mexico City, it's such a big city.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.000]   It's such a big city that you don't,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.680]   it's not a touristy place, right?
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.560]   It's really dominated by Mexicans, right?
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.240]   The city is living and breathing
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   and pulsing with Mexicans.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.920]   So you're there, you're not real important,
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.480]   you're just kind of observing and flowing
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.000]   and trying to flow with that city,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.160]   'cause if you're flowing against it,
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.500]   it's the chaos, the traffic, it's a bad scene, right?
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:41.500]   So that's why you really do well to go with an expert
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.140]   or someone, if you're really lucky, a friend,
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.100]   or you're an invited guest.
[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.200]   But if you're not, someone who understands the city
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.660]   and how to get around and how to avoid that chaos.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.160]   So yeah, I'd say that.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.380]   Now, as far as the highlights, right?
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.680]   You've got the Historic Center.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.440]   There's several UNESCO World Heritage sites
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.680]   within Mexico City.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.300]   You've got the Historic City Center,
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.080]   which has the Metropolitan Cathedral.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.080]   It's got the Zócalo, which is the central square,
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.600]   which is the third largest central square in the world.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.080]   It's got the Templo Mayor,
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.800]   which was the Aztec capital archeological site.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.280]   You've got the Palacio de Gobierno,
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.840]   which is the government palace,
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.900]   which has the Diego Rivera murals,
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.440]   which by the way, you can't see right now, unfortunately.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.120]   You've got the Palacio de Bellas Artes,
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.320]   the Fine Arts Center, which has other incredible
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.900]   Orozco murals and other of the great muralists.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.920]   The whole city, they call it the city of palaces,
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.400]   because it literally was just lined up
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.880]   with palace after palace during the colonial era.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.680]   Each family trying to outdo the next
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.040]   with the grandeur and the majesticness
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.660]   of these different palaces.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:47:00.660]   They now have taken on the function of the correos,
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.440]   the mail room, or the post office.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.200]   And then some of them are government offices
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.140]   and some of them are museums.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.120]   So it's an incredible center,
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.400]   really tight, dense historic center
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.840]   with architecture and all the rest.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.680]   Speaking of architecture, you could spend a whole day
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.840]   exploring the architectural riches of Mexico City,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.620]   including La Gorreta or Barragan.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.200]   I mean, these are just incredible world-renowned architects
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.220]   that have their work spread out throughout the city.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.680]   You also have the pyramids, right,
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.440]   which are the third and fourth largest
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   pyramidal temples in the world.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.000]   They're about 45 minutes outside of Mexico City.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.640]   That's a must-do, must-see for sure.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.800]   You've got the south of the city,
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.160]   which includes Coyoacan and San Angel.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.120]   This is where Xochimilco is.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.960]   These are very traditional neighborhoods
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.360]   where you can still feel the Mexico City
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.680]   of the '40s and '50s and '60s,
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   before it just got subsumed by this massive metropolis.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.720]   You've got Spanish colonial architecture.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.640]   You've got cobblestone streets.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.520]   You also have the Saturday Market in San Angel.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.760]   And then you've got Xochimilco,
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.680]   which is some of the last remaining
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.760]   preserved Aztec waterways, right?
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.180]   All of Mexico City actually sits on what were,
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:26.520]   basically, wetlands and canals, much like Venice, right?
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.600]   So the transport, the mode of transport
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.880]   back in the day of the Aztecs,
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.120]   when the Spanish first arrived, was by canoe.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.560]   And Xochimilco is some of the last preserved
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.280]   traditional floating gardens,
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.360]   the chinampas and the canals.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.400]   And you can see what that was like.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.680]   We also have some access to lesser visited ones.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.200]   This is a very raucous,
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.680]   the Xochimilco is a very raucous, touristy,
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.160]   a Saturday or a Sunday there is filled
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.720]   with Mexican families and mariachis
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.840]   and beer-slinging vendors.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.880]   And it's a lot of fun,
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.960]   but it's pretty dynamic, let's say.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:10.000]   We've got access to some areas that are not as busy,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.160]   and you can get a little bit more peaceful experience
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.720]   of what those canals were like.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.160]   So that right there, I think I've named enough stuff
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.720]   to be three or four full days, right?
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.560]   - Yeah.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.600]   - And that's full days.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   You then have the neighborhoods of Condesa and Roma, right?
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.960]   If you wanna go check out the gallery scene and the art
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.160]   and just cruise and have a coffee
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.640]   and see kind of the contemporary creative class
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:35.800]   and what's going on there.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.760]   By the way, Mexico City and especially Roma Norte
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   and Condesa have become these enclaves,
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.360]   international enclaves, especially full of North Americans,
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.160]   Americans and Canadians who have remote working,
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.960]   global nomads, people living and working remotely.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.920]   And you can hear quite a bit of English these days
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.560]   on the streets, it's interesting.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:01.560]   And then you've got so many other kind of more subtle things
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:05.000]   if you're into art or if you're into handicrafts
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.600]   or if you're into museums.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.840]   We didn't even mention the Anthropology Museum,
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.480]   all the different museums and these different...
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.120]   So you've got a week minimum to kind of make sure
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:21.120]   that you hit all of the great museums, galleries,
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:25.880]   the highlights that we mentioned, check out Reforma,
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.960]   then the nightlife, the restaurants.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.880]   So...
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.600]   - Yeah, I think we under-indexed on museums
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.800]   and over-indexed on food as we often do,
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.000]   trying to fit, you know, we're like,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   how do we fit four meals in a day?
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.440]   How do we try all the things?
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:46.440]   I was blown away at the quality of the food you get
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:51.240]   and the price, like meals that would be hundreds
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.400]   and hundreds of dollars in the US for less than $100.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.240]   - And how about the service?
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.560]   - It doesn't feel like you're sacrificing anything
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.040]   other than a couple hours on a plane.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.680]   - Well, again, and this is, and trust me,
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.840]   I've thought about it more than once,
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.320]   like just get on a plane just to get some tacos for lunch.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   I mean, it is that good,
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.200]   but I meant the service is so good and it's so natural.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.480]   And, you know, before you even know you need something,
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.640]   it's there in front of you.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.840]   The service in Mexico and in Mexico City in particular
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.000]   is phenomenal, it's world-class.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Yeah, but don't sell the museum short, right?
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.560]   You've got the Anthro Museum,
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.720]   which you could spend literally days in.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.960]   You've got, you know, the Casa Azul,
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.560]   which is Frida Kahlo's childhood home.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.400]   You've got the Dolores Olmedo,
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.080]   if you're interested in Diego and Frida.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.040]   You've just got all kinds of museums,
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:47.360]   even within Chapultepec Park.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.280]   There's several other museums, there's nonstop.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   You really could spend a week
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.040]   just going through the museums.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.640]   You know that the Zona Maco,
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.640]   which is the largest contemporary art fair in Latin America
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.760]   is held every year in Mexico City.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.560]   And it's fascinating the amount of private collections,
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.400]   which we can, by the way,
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.520]   we can open for people who are interested in that
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.240]   through the relationships that we have.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.680]   So there's just so much to do.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   - You've mentioned a few things
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.080]   that you guys might have access to.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.280]   And one question that I imagine someone,
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.200]   myself included, are wondering is,
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.240]   you know, when you work with people
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.600]   to help them plan these amazing trips to Mexico,
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.400]   does someone, if someone's just looking
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:29.040]   for a really interesting tour for a day in Mexico City,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.040]   can they reach out to you and do that?
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.120]   Or is it more of a, let's plan the whole thing?
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.800]   - We would love to be able to help everyone
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.600]   with even the littlest tiny bit,
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.320]   but we are a small boutique company.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.480]   We don't have the resources to kind of be able to help you
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.800]   with one day trip here or there.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.220]   So we do tend to focus on whole holidays, whole trips.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.280]   But you know, if you catch us in a moment
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.600]   where we're not too busy,
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.580]   we'd be glad to help with whatever you need.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.880]   But in general, we do stay busy, thankfully.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.960]   So it is generally the whole thing, yeah.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.720]   - So we didn't, you've gotten so many recommendations
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.320]   that I'm like, these show notes are gonna be long.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.940]   We might even need a second page for them.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:11.840]   But on the food side, if someone's really looking to eat
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.560]   in Mexico City, do you have any favorites to suggest,
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.520]   either food or drink or both?
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:20.320]   - You know, there's just, yes, loads.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.100]   And I think that there's an over-focus
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.360]   on kind of the iconic, you've got Pujol
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.880]   and you've got Rosetta and you've got, you know,
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.280]   these restaurants that, Gusino, Oaxaca,
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.160]   and you've got these restaurants
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:38.360]   that people are so focused on that they have to go to.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.420]   But there's a whole world of restaurants
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.800]   that you're not sacrificing anything in quality.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.640]   You know, maybe they haven't done as good marketing-wise.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.560]   But yeah, Contramar and all of these kind
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.140]   of more recognized places are wonderful.
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:55.980]   They're awesome.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.360]   I'm not taking anything away from them.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:00.060]   But it's a real challenge to get in,
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.000]   especially if you're not making
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.280]   your reservations months in advance.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.920]   So we pride ourselves on staying up
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.420]   on the latest and greatest, and we're happy to share them.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.260]   It's kind of, it doesn't make a lot of sense
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.160]   to share them right now out loud
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.800]   because, you know, tomorrow they're not good,
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.280]   today they are, you know, you have to really--
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.240]   - But they're on the website,
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.680]   and we can link to them in the show notes?
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.120]   - Yeah, we have them.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.160]   We don't put them on the website,
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.400]   but we have those restaurant recommendations.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.880]   They're very carefully guarded and curated
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.840]   and updated constantly, and we're glad to share them
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.060]   with those who are planning travel with us.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.980]   - Okay, so if someone's not excited about Mexico City,
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.760]   I think you're missing out.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.640]   But let's talk about this third category
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.400]   of other places in Mexico, not beach,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.840]   that I think probably go maybe the least noticed
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.400]   by the average North American traveler.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.000]   Talk about some of the ones that you think need
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.320]   to be on people's kind of radar for something.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.160]   - Sure, sure, sure.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.920]   So I'm gonna go just to help myself organize my thoughts
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.160]   from Northwest to Southeast.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.640]   I think of it kind of geographically.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.560]   I mentioned already Todos Santos,
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.020]   which is this kind of magical town.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.760]   And by the way, the Pueblos Magicos, or Magic Towns,
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.200]   is a program that Mexico's tourism board developed
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.600]   to kind of shine a light on some of these lesser-visited
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.880]   cultural heritage hotspots.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.320]   So check that out, by the way.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.440]   You can search that.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.840]   We have articles on our blog.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.960]   We'll put that in the trip notes as well
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.940]   that point to some of these different magic towns.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.080]   But in addition to Todos Santos,
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.400]   don't forget the Valle de Guadalupe,
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.780]   which is the wine-producing region in northern Baja.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.720]   You've got the whole Sierra Cortez side, right,
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.800]   that includes Muleje, Loreto, La Paz.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.240]   These are all incredible places in Baja.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.400]   Moving across onto the continent now,
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.700]   you've got the Copper Canyon.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.640]   This is a place that, no matter how much I've championed it,
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.760]   it goes unnoticed.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.640]   It is four times the size of the Grand Canyon in the United
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.600]   States.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:08.200]   It's composed of seven major canyons and 22 minor canyons.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.600]   And it's like visiting the Grand Canyon 100 years ago.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.160]   There's indigenous people living in the caves
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.320]   and on the side of cliffs.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.520]   There's just incredible jaw-dropping landscapes.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.140]   There's amazing opportunities for hiking, mountain biking,
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:27.020]   rock climbing, you name it.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.580]   And there's a train that crisscrosses and traverses
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.660]   the whole canyon system called El Chepe.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.980]   So that's another amazing place.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:39.300]   Los Alamos, which is also up in Sinaloa,
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.340]   another amazing town.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:43.340]   Now coming down a bit further down the coast,
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:48.100]   I'd say don't miss Sayulita or San Pancho, which
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.460]   is north of Puerto Vallarta.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.860]   Those are amazing little villages
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.860]   that are really worth visiting.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:59.600]   You've got tons in the cultural interior, right?
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.580]   Cities like Durango or Zacatecas,
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:06.360]   Guanajuato, San Miguel Allende, these are all kind of on there.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.760]   If you think about the Rocky Mountains in the US,
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.260]   they don't stop just because you've
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.340]   got a border with Mexico.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.580]   They continue, and the name changes.
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:16.940]   It's called the Sierra Madre, the Mother Mountains.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:21.420]   And within these mountains exist these beautiful mountain
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:21.920]   towns.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.180]   So I'm talking about a few of them, Guanajuato,
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:26.020]   San Miguel Allende.
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:28.380]   Mexico City is found in that same mountain range.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.980]   But going a little bit further south,
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.460]   you've got Oaxaca, San Cristobal de las Casas down in Chiapas.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:39.620]   These are some of the most beautiful, lesser-visited
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:44.060]   cultural heritage destinations that you can find in Mexico.
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.060]   People travel halfway around the world
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:50.020]   to find cultural richness, history, indigenous culture
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.700]   that they can find right here in Mexico.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.220]   I feel like there's like 10 trips I could take to Mexico
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.460]   that I haven't really processed before.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:57:59.700]   Some of them will be repeats.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.180]   I feel like just talking about Mexico City
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.060]   makes me want to go back.
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.500]   So that's on the docket.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.420]   Did we miss anything?
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.560]   I feel like--
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.700]   So much.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:10.540]   We missed so much.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:12.620]   Can we go-- we've got to go on for days here.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.660]   But next time you go to Mexico City,
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.540]   go and have a visit to Puebla.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:20.860]   Puebla is two hours south of Mexico City.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:22.940]   In fact, you can take this little road that
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.420]   goes from Mexico City to Puebla that
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:31.300]   goes between two volcanoes that are almost 17,000-foot
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.700]   volcanoes, Iztaccihuatl and Popocatépetl.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.780]   If you can pronounce those real fast 10 times,
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.060]   I'll give you a free trip there.
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.780]   But the road is called the Paso de Cortés
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:46.460]   because when Hernán Cortés came from the port of Veracruz,
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:49.340]   which is in the Gulf of Mexico, and he came up to--
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:54.300]   he had intel about what was going on in Mexico City
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.820]   and the Aztecs and everything else.
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.540]   And he was coming up with La Malinche,
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:59.200]   which was the traitorous--
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.860]   well, I won't get into that whole story.
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.660]   But he comes up from Veracruz to Puebla
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:08.180]   and then crosses from Cholula into the Valley of Mexico.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:11.220]   If you get a chance, read the book Mexico by James Michener.
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:15.060]   It gives this incredible account of that journey.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.180]   It's a little bit of historical nonfiction.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:19.060]   But it's worth reading.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.700]   And it's this little dirt road that
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:23.620]   goes between the saddle of these volcanoes.
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:25.940]   And as you come down into the Valley of Mexico,
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:26.860]   you really--
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.020]   it's jaw-dropping.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.180]   And we're talking about you're in pine forests
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.420]   with glaciated volcanoes on either side of you, one of which
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.780]   is very active, by the way.
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.220]   So you've got to check to make sure
[00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:39.340]   that it's open on the day that you decide to go.
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.820]   We'll give you some tips to do it.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.060]   It's an amazing, amazing way to do it.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.740]   And you go and check out Puebla.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:47.820]   Have more than 360 churches in Puebla.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.820]   Got incredible colonial architecture.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.420]   It's the home of mole.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.540]   And then, actually, don't go back to Mexico City.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.940]   Keep going to Oaxaca.
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:57.540]   You got to go to-- have you been to Oaxaca, Chris?
[00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:59.140]   I have not.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.820]   I had a list of things I want to discuss.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.020]   The last question was, I was like,
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.540]   I don't feel like we've talked about Oaxaca.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.540]   And I feel like I keep hearing people have incredible trips.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.740]   So the two places that I think--
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.900]   Oaxaca is probably more well-known.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.980]   But Oaxaca and San Cristobal de las Casas
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.500]   are two of the most beautiful mountain towns
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.660]   where indigenous pre-Columbian culture is most intact.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.940]   Probably San Cristobal is more so.
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:27.620]   Oaxaca has become more popular and more visited,
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.940]   but still really retains its charm.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:32.720]   So the beauty of Oaxaca is the fact
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.420]   that it has this really strong pre-Columbian indigenous
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:41.700]   cultural roots that are still living on strongly to this day.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.140]   And you've got people--
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:48.380]   these are Mixtec and Zapotec people
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.340]   that are still speaking their native languages.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.060]   I mean, they obviously also speak Spanish.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.820]   And some of them even speak English.
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.340]   And these are artisans, and these are farmers.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.420]   And they're people that are producing mezcal.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.020]   They're producing handicrafts.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.140]   They're farming the land.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.420]   They're living very much traditional lifestyles
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.660]   that have gone on for centuries.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:13.140]   And this, as I was mentioning earlier in the show,
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:16.020]   the indigenous roots, the pre-Columbian culture,
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.300]   lives on so strongly that it influences everything about it.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.900]   So the food, the dress, they're still
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.020]   wearing traditional clothing.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.460]   They're still living subsistence agricultural lives,
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:30.220]   many of them, in the valleys surrounding Oaxaca.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.860]   But the influence on the food, the art, the history,
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.980]   the culture is overwhelming.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:42.180]   And really, it's hard to find such a pure evolution
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.060]   and a real organic evolution of the indigenous culture
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.260]   into contemporary life.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.500]   And I think the pride that these people have has--
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.780]   and the recognition and the celebration
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.620]   of the international community has
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.220]   helped to preserve this and celebrate it and protect it.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.620]   So very much worth a visit.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:04.460]   But if you really want to get even more off the beaten path,
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.620]   check out Chiapas, the state of Chiapas
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:09.340]   and the town of San Cristobal de las Casas,
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.660]   and then the lowland jungles where
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.580]   you have one of the most incredible
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.820]   archaeological sites, Palenque.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:21.100]   And are these places that someone who--
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.420]   let's just assume for this conversation hasn't
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:26.020]   planned a trip with you guys, people can just go to?
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.060]   Do they need to set up tours and guides?
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.740]   Do they just show up?
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.220]   I mean, look, that's a good question about anywhere, right?
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.500]   So it's how comfortable, how intrepid are you?
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.580]   But yes, I mean, there's a Lonely Planet.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.500]   There's guidebooks.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.860]   There's public transportation.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.020]   There's the internet.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.700]   You don't even need this stuff anymore.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:48.220]   But it's definitely probably--
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.740]   I'd gauge it by how intrepid you are
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.340]   and how comfortable you feel navigating
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.780]   lesser-visited places, places where maybe not everybody
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.220]   speaks English.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:01.500]   And yeah, but certainly with the internet and email
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.340]   and everything else you can set up accommodation
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.740]   and experiences on your own just depends
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.260]   on your own comfort level.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.020]   And how much work you want to do, right?
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:15.260]   If you want to spend hours and hours planning this or not,
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:19.260]   obviously, that's-- and what experience do you want.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.740]   I know there was a window where I remember people
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.900]   asking about safety in Mexico.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.380]   Is that still a concern?
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.580]   Should people be thinking about that at all, planning a trip?
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.180]   Well, it's funny you should say that.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.100]   I knew that the pandemic was coming
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.700]   to an end when people's questions of concern
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.820]   shifted back from COVID questions
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:43.660]   to safety and security questions.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:47.060]   And so it's a constant headwind that we face when planning
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.300]   travel to Mexico.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.940]   Unfortunately, there's this stereotype.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.220]   And people are always asking, is it safe?
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.860]   And will I get sick?
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.220]   And that kind of stuff.
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.620]   And honestly, Mexico has come so far
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.380]   from the days of Montezuma's revenge.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.860]   That doesn't mean that you can't get
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.140]   sick when you travel to Mexico.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.260]   You can get sick when you travel anywhere.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.540]   The first recommendation I'd have
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.420]   is don't drink yourself silly.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:13.660]   Use sunblock.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.340]   And don't get sunburned.
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.940]   And don't get dehydrated, right?
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:21.500]   That's usually the beginning of all of this stuff.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:26.140]   But the whole education and consciousness
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:30.940]   about water purification and even ice purification,
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.740]   you don't have to ask anymore, is the water purified, right?
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.420]   I mean, in tourists, in restaurants,
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.660]   locals are not drinking tap water.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.260]   Locals are drinking purified water.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.100]   Locals are drinking purified ice.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.300]   And in terms of safety and security,
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.180]   look, anywhere you can have issues,
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.940]   the idea is to be in the right place at the right time.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.860]   Mexico is safe in general.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.840]   And it behooves you-- and it's really your responsibility
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.100]   as a traveler-- to make sure that you understand
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.340]   what are the safe places.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:04.940]   I mean, what about parts of upper Manhattan?
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.340]   What about parts of Chicago and Detroit?
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:09.260]   Like, there is--
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.340]   I think you said you're in the Bay Area, right?
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.060]   There are certainly places in the Bay Area
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.500]   you wouldn't want to be after dark.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.060]   There's parts of LA and San Diego as well.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.380]   So Houston, Dallas.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:24.220]   So knowing where you should be and where you shouldn't,
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.300]   being well aware of your whereabouts.
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.180]   And those are all kind of recommendations
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.380]   you make for any place you travel in the world.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.580]   Mexico is still a developing country.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.780]   So you have to keep your wits about you
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.180]   and be well-educated and aware.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:44.340]   But I don't think it's a reason why people should not--
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.500]   would I recommend to my own mother, my own sister,
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.180]   my own family to travel just about anywhere in Mexico?
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:50.460]   I would.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.460]   And if there are places that I would recommend
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.820]   they don't travel, I'd let them know that as well.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.500]   Yeah, I always tell people, you know,
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.660]   you read guides online that say, well, this place is safe.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.700]   It might not be safe.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.300]   Keep your money in a money belt and all this stuff.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.140]   I always point out that if you go pick up
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.780]   The Lonely Planet for New York, it says a similar thing.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.700]   Like, we don't read guidebooks for our own towns.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.300]   So we don't realize that the general advice
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.700]   applies everywhere.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:19.980]   And would you say that, like, a hotel concierge or the person
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.020]   at the front desk is, like, a good person to ask?
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:24.820]   Or how would someone get acquainted with where to
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:25.500]   and not to go?
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.260]   Absolutely.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.700]   I think that your hotel staff, I think even taxi drivers,
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.820]   you know, I mean, official taxi drivers,
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.820]   that's another recommendation we always make.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.580]   You don't take just a taxi off the street.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.900]   You get it at the airport, the official taxis,
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.780]   or at the hotel, an official taxi stand.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.260]   But locals don't want visitors getting hurt or in trouble.
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.780]   So absolutely, I think the concierge, the reception,
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.180]   they're going to give you good advice as to where, what, when,
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.740]   with whom, how to get around, and how to keep yourself safe.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.660]   So you said official taxis.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.540]   What other things, just kind of running
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.580]   through the how to get the best optimized trip to Mexico,
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.220]   I'll give one question.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.700]   I always remember my cousin and I were in Puerto Vallarta.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.460]   My grandparents had a timeshare for 20 years in Puerto Vallarta
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:14.460]   at the Mayan palace.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.340]   And then they kept upgrading.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.700]   And we were always thinking, gosh,
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:24.620]   it seems like we wanted to go dune bugging in high school.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.660]   And it was like, everyone seemed like they
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.020]   were going to make 20%, 30%.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.780]   And the way it always worked was pay us a 20% down payment
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.540]   and pay the rest when you get there.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.980]   So we had convinced ourselves that if we could just
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:41.020]   find the source, we could avoid the 20%.
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.740]   Is that the way it works?
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.260]   What advice do you give someone who's
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:49.580]   trying to avoid getting taken advantage of in that way?
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.860]   I think that you want to think about it in a different way.
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.100]   What you really want, especially when you're going dune bugging,
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:01.140]   is to find the best operated, safest dune buggies.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.980]   And so you need a trusted source to get you there,
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.220]   not just someone who wants to make money on you.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.180]   The cost of distribution, you know
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.540]   how wholesale and retail works.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.380]   The dune buggy guy is focused on running his dune buggies.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.860]   He's not focused on marketing and selling you tours.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:18.420]   So he has a whole army of people,
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.580]   from timeshare salesmen, to concierge companies,
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:24.500]   to airport transportation people.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:29.580]   So I think that the key is working with an expert company
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.460]   that is locally based, that has their eyes and ears
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.620]   to the ground, and can really, at the end of the day,
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:36.260]   everyone has to make their money.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.740]   And if you buy the tour directly from the tour company,
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.180]   you're still going to pay the retail price.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.500]   But you just don't know which tour company to buy from.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.860]   So I think using travel professionals who are really
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:50.220]   experts and have local presence and eyes and ears on the ground,
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.100]   that's my recommendation.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.220]   And where do the hotels fit into that?
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:00.140]   Is it find the experts in organizing trips and adventures,
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:04.860]   or is that over using your hotel as a source?
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.780]   I think that's a little tricky.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.820]   I do think, in general, that hotels
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.300]   want you to have a good experience.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.780]   They want to see you coming back from your tour day with smiles
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.220]   and having had a great time.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:21.100]   That said, hotels are also incentivized by commission.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.500]   But I would like to think that, in general, they're
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.860]   going to get a commission from whomever they work with.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:28.260]   They'd like to work with the people that
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.940]   are going to return you safe and sound
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.020]   and with a smile on your face.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:35.460]   Tips for traveling, or booking, or saving money,
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.140]   or anything that kind of falls outside
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.660]   of the general overview?
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.900]   Since you mentioned money and how
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:44.420]   to avoid excessive surcharges and commissions,
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:48.180]   I found the best way to get cash is actually using your ATM card.
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.540]   Just check before you leave what are the affiliated banks
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:56.140]   in the country you're going to.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.740]   And in addition, when you take out the money,
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:03.700]   make sure that you decline their conversion.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.340]   The ATMs in Mexico will--
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:07.420]   you'll say, OK, I want 10,000 pesos.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.380]   And then they'll say, OK, 10,000 pesos equals this much dollars.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.780]   Do you accept our conversion?
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.300]   You say no.
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.140]   And then your bank will do the conversion
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.740]   at a pre-negotiated rate.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:20.700]   And you're avoiding another level of commission.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.580]   So that's the way that I would get cash.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:26.980]   Paying local currency is always better than using dollars,
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:30.780]   where you're going to get an onerous conversion or exchange
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:31.340]   rate.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.580]   And do you need cash?
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:35.060]   Or are we at a place now in Mexico
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.140]   where cards and Apple Pay are--
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:38.500]   Cards are ubiquitous.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.380]   I mean, cards are widely accepted.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.820]   But it's always good to have a little bit of cash.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.940]   I mean, even in the States, I walk around
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.140]   with a $100 bill folded up inside my wallet,
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.660]   just in case, right?
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.220]   I carry $100, a $20, and a $2.
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.500]   Cool, this has been great.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.620]   I really appreciate it.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.460]   Where can people go find all of this stuff?
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.580]   We're going to put lots of links in the show notes.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:00.180]   But where can people stay on top of all these great things
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.820]   you're finding?
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:07.140]   We have an extensive website, journeymexico.com.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.140]   We've got all kinds of links to accommodation,
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:13.580]   to sample itineraries, to best times to travel,
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:18.340]   to different ceremonies and celebrations,
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.940]   different natural migrations, whales, turtles,
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:22.900]   all kinds of stuff.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.660]   So yeah, I like to think that we've
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.740]   been told that it's a comprehensive resource.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.140]   So you can find that in the trip notes too.
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:30.940]   Awesome.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.500]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.820]   Thank you, Chris.
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.420]   All right, I don't know about you guys,
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.620]   but I am really excited to go to Mexico.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.340]   I already have one trip planned, but I
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:41.980]   feel like there's a lot more coming in my future.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.380]   So before we wrap, I wanted to dive a little bit
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.260]   into flights and hotels to help make your next trip even
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.180]   better.
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.700]   I'm actually going to do an entire episode sometime
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.260]   in the next six or seven months that
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.220]   includes how to search for flights,
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.300]   how to search for hotels, and get the best
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.780]   deal with points and miles.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.780]   So when I do these country deep dives,
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.900]   I'm going to focus mostly on some unique, specific things
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.100]   that are maybe a little different than what you need
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.060]   to do for any trip in general.
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:10.180]   So when I looked into flights, first off,
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:13.420]   Mexico is not that far away for people that lived in the US,
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.300]   or Mexico is not that far away for people
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.300]   who live in the US or Canada.
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.100]   And flights can often be pretty cheap.
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.020]   So it's a little bit of a different experience
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.220]   than trying to book flights to Iceland or Japan
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.420]   or other places where you have to cross an ocean
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.820]   and you might really value being in business class
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:31.740]   versus a short flight where economy is just fine.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.060]   That said, I'm going to hit both of those things.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.820]   And when you're searching for flights,
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.580]   obviously, Google Flights is your friend.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:38.660]   It's a tool I use.
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.180]   But because you're in North America
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:42.620]   and Southwest flies to Mexico, you'll
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:47.180]   definitely want to check the Southwest site as well.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.980]   And make sure you're looking at a couple other airlines,
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.460]   Volaris, Viva Aerobus.
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:52.740]   They also fly to the US.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.060]   They're not the most obvious.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.860]   But I'm going to drill in and quickly focus
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.540]   on a few unique things I learned about points and miles
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.860]   just to help you get your searches going.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:03.780]   So first off, I did a bunch of searches just in October
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.940]   this year to try to get a sense of where you want to book for.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.500]   So on the SkyTeam side, Aeromexico
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.540]   has a ton of flights to the US.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.820]   And when you're trying to book those flights,
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.620]   I found the best way to do it is through Delta.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.380]   And so if you have Amex points, you
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.060]   can transfer directly to Delta.
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.460]   That's a great option.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.980]   Not that you can't book those flights on Aeromexico,
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:25.860]   but they're just going to be more expensive.
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:30.020]   So for example, I looked at a flight from Chicago
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.620]   to Mexico City, and the flight was $322.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:36.420]   But on Delta, it was only 10,000 points,
[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.260]   despite being 30,000 points on Aeromexico,
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:41.780]   which is as high as $0.03 per point, which
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.660]   is a great redemption value.
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:48.020]   In business, flights are about $550 and 25,000 points
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:48.940]   on Delta.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.260]   So you could get a little bit lower value, $0.02 per point.
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.500]   But in general, pretty good redemption value.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.460]   I know a lot of times we talk about needing
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:59.700]   to go on really far, fancy business class flights
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.500]   to get good value from our points.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.300]   And I know even more, we talk about Delta
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.340]   being really hard to find any value.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.140]   But 10,000 points for a $320 flight
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.780]   is an awesome deal if you have some Delta points,
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.540]   or if you have Amex points that you can transfer to Delta.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.140]   Next, I looked at a flight in One World on American
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.900]   from Chicago to Cancun.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.420]   In economy, that flight was $291.
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:24.060]   And yes, you could book directly with American for 20,000 points.
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.060]   But you can also book that flight on British Airways
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.860]   for only 11,000 points.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.660]   And British Airways often has transfer bonuses
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.380]   from Chase and Capital One and American Express.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.180]   But even without that, it's great
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.660]   because British Airways is a transfer partner of almost
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.620]   every single major card program.
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.780]   And so you can get obvious points very easily.
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:49.940]   That ended up being about $0.06 per point, which is awesome.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.220]   And the taxes and fees on British Airways
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:56.220]   domestically or within North America
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.540]   are so much better than they are if you're looking
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.060]   to fly internationally.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.500]   In business class, flight was $486.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.500]   And you could do it for 22,000 points on British Airways
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.300]   or 30,000 points on American.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:13.780]   So not quite as good of a value, but not terrible.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.900]   So again, really good values on short-term flights.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.340]   But knowing which airline to book through
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.700]   is part of the challenge of getting the best deal.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.260]   Sky Team, Delta was the best.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.100]   American, British Airways the best.
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.860]   Last, I looked at Star Alliance.
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.900]   I looked at a specific flight from Washington DC to Cancun.
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.300]   And on United, the flight was $200.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.860]   You could actually get it for as low as 10,000 points
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.660]   as long as you booked on Air Canada.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.820]   It was about 12,000 on United, about $0.02 per point.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.260]   Not too different booking between the two programs.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:46.500]   But when you look at business class, it changed a lot.
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.060]   If you booked through Turkish Airways,
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.580]   a flight that was $469 was 15,000 points.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:55.580]   Air Canada was 20,000 and United was 35,000.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.940]   So you could get a much, much better deal
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.620]   booking on Turkish Airways.
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:03.700]   And you could get as high as 3 cents per point that way.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.180]   Not saying you need to use all your points
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.900]   for a first class or business class flight going to Mexico.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.180]   'Cause if you're in North America,
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:10.620]   the flights are pretty short.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:13.180]   But it is worth pointing out that where you search
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.260]   and where you book might be different.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:17.140]   And just because it's a United plane
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:20.340]   doesn't mean United is gonna be the right place to book.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.820]   Also worth noting that taxes and fees
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.980]   across different airlines can be different.
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:28.820]   So while Air Canada looked like the better option in coach
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.740]   because it was 10,000 versus 12,000 points,
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.140]   the taxes and fees were about twice as high.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.480]   So definitely compare both number of points
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.340]   and taxes and fees on that route.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:42.220]   A few other things related to flights that are interesting.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.040]   Number one, Southwest Companion Pass.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.980]   If you have a lot of trips to Mexico planned
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:49.340]   can be a really, really, really great option.
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.580]   I've talked about this in the past,
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:53.060]   so you can go to allthehacks.com and search.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.180]   But in general, if you can manage to,
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:58.180]   through credit card points or flight points,
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.220]   build up enough points, which I think right now
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.820]   is 135,000 on Southwest.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.660]   Whatever year you hit that milestone,
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.120]   you get Companion Pass that year and the next year.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.100]   And because you can go to Mexico with Southwest,
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.300]   you can get two for one flights for that entire period,
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.620]   which could be as much as almost two years.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.700]   Last cool flight hack, which is very niche.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.540]   If you live in San Diego,
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.220]   I only recently learned about this.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.500]   Maybe it is common knowledge for everyone there,
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.380]   but there's actually a cross-border,
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.360]   kind of border crossing at the Tijuana Airport,
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.860]   where you can drive, park in the US,
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.340]   and the Tijuana Airport is literally
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.060]   right on the other side of the border.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:38.100]   So you can go through cross-border express,
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:42.140]   do all your customs and immigration much, much faster,
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.260]   literally cross a bridge over the border into Mexico,
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.760]   into the Tijuana Airport,
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.700]   and then buy domestic flights within Mexico.
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.540]   And they are so, so, so much cheaper.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.820]   Not worth it if you need to fly to San Diego
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:58.380]   and then take an Uber or a Lyft between airports,
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.220]   probably not a good thing.
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:02.140]   But if you're already in San Diego and you haven't tried that
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.740]   a friend of mine did that and had a great experience.
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:05.860]   Okay, when it comes to hotels,
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:08.100]   similarly gonna do a whole episode here,
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.620]   because I think that the strategies
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.740]   for each of these episodes,
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:14.340]   when I talk about a country are pretty much the same.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:18.720]   So for Mexico, you know, between Hyatt at 59 hotels,
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.840]   Marriott at 274, Hilton at 93,
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.360]   and IHG I couldn't figure out,
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.760]   but Google Bards says IHG has 524 hotels in Mexico.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.280]   I assume that number is wrong,
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.720]   but I think the moral of the story is
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.960]   there are hundreds of hotels
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.640]   you can book with points in Mexico.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.480]   So going through all of them would just be way too much.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.100]   I will highlight a few places
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:39.320]   that I'm either excited about,
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.480]   have stayed at, or have heard good things.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.940]   If you're going to Cabo,
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.780]   the Waldorf with Hilton points, I've heard is incredible.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:49.780]   The Cape with Hyatt points, I've heard is incredible.
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:53.620]   And Solaz, which closed down for a couple of years
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:55.900]   using Bonvoy points through Marriott,
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:57.780]   we have stayed at and I can say
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.940]   that it was really, really great.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.980]   Everything from the pool, to the food, to the drinks,
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.500]   we had a wonderful time.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.580]   I would definitely go back there.
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.860]   If you're going to Punta Mida,
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:09.820]   the St. Regis and the Conrad both look great.
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.240]   I have not been to either.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.780]   If you're going to kind of Cancun, Riviera Maya,
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:16.780]   the Andaz Mayakoba is one that we've had on our list.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.620]   That entire Mayakoba complex,
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:21.260]   you can kind of search around a little bit, looks amazing.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.740]   If you really want to splurge,
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.300]   you can go to the Rosewood Mayakoba,
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:27.380]   which looks just a level above.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.900]   But we talked about our points,
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.820]   so I haven't been there yet.
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.060]   I have been to the JW in Cancun
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.780]   on a family trip almost a decade ago,
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:38.940]   and it was a great experience for exactly what you want.
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.640]   A really nice JW Marriott hotel,
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.400]   pools, beaches, everything.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.160]   It was just good,
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.000]   but there was nothing that really set it out
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.320]   side of craziness for me.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.960]   In Mexico City, we stayed at the St. Regis,
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.600]   super central, fantastic experience, really loved it.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.040]   But Las Alcobas also looks like a cool hotel
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.680]   we might check out next time.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:04.560]   And then across a couple of different cities in Mexico,
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.200]   I know at least Cancun and Cabo,
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:10.320]   Hyatt has these two brands, the Zalara and the Ziva,
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.280]   and they're both all-inclusive.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.260]   And I've heard really great experiences about both.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:18.240]   One of them happens to be adults only,
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.300]   so Zalara is all-inclusive adults only,
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:23.040]   and Ziva is like all-inclusive families.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.840]   Definitely something that I want to try out
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.120]   on a future trip.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.320]   Ziva is probably the one in our future,
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.440]   but if anyone's had good or bad experiences there,
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.560]   let me know.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.320]   I've been fortunate to go to Cabo quite a few times
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:39.320]   for group trips, many bachelor parties in my years,
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.120]   and booking villas is also a really great option.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.280]   So just because you can't use points there
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.080]   doesn't mean it's not worth considering.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.120]   Having a big house for a lot of people,
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.800]   we did this also for my family over the holidays
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.880]   a couple of years ago, you can hire a chef,
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.500]   and it just really creates an amazing experience.
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.480]   So if anyone needs help with that,
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.040]   I have a bunch of good relationships
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.440]   with some villa companies, happy to connect you there.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.640]   You can just shoot me an email, podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.160]   Also for houses, you can use Capital One Points
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:13.760]   or Wyndham Points and Capital One Transfers to Wyndham
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:16.080]   to book vacasas, and you can get as high
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.580]   as two to three cents per point there.
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.460]   So you can go search online,
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:20.720]   or I'll put a link in the show notes
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.240]   to find the Wyndham to Vacasa transfer flow
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.400]   and how it works, but that's an option.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.020]   And then last, I just helped,
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:32.760]   I just put together a site that I'd love to share
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.880]   with anyone who's interested.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:37.160]   Just shoot us an email, podcast@allthehacks.com
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.400]   to help you use our upgrade program online.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.260]   Alternatively, you can go to allthehacks.com/upgrade
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.720]   or email, get email upgrade@allthehacks.com.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.800]   Alternatively, you can go to allthehacks.com/upgrade
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.360]   and read a little bit more about it.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.100]   But we have a site where you can look online
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.680]   and book all of these five-star properties,
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.280]   not with points, but through the various programs
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.000]   where you get upgrades and perks.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.760]   So for example, in almost all of them,
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.840]   you'll end up getting free breakfast,
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.240]   you'll get an upgrade if it's available,
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.660]   early, late checkout, early check-in, late checkout
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.080]   if it's available, and usually a property credit
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.940]   of somewhere around $100 for your stay there.
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.960]   Very similar to the Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts perks,
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.820]   except it's about 3,000, 4,000 hotels
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.680]   instead of Amex's 1,000.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.720]   And we finally have put together a site
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.000]   so you can use that yourself
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.460]   and do your searching on your own.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:30.280]   So if you want access to it, shoot me an email
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.500]   or go to allthehacks.com/upgrade.
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.840]   And then last, I wanna do an episode on this,
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.020]   but I'll do a quick rundown
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.900]   'cause there's a few sites and tools
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:41.080]   for booking award rooms with hotels
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.160]   that I've noticed recently,
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.240]   and I just wanna do a really quick overview of them.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.800]   So first, I've talked about Aways a lot,
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.100]   and you can go to allthehacks.com/aways
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.940]   to get a special deal there.
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.640]   I think Aways is the best tool for a search where you say,
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.120]   I wanna go to Paris and I wanna use my points
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.880]   and I have points in these programs, what should I do?
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.200]   And that is the search that I think they nail
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.320]   and they do a really fantastic job.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.160]   And usually that's how we're doing our searches,
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.980]   so it's usually my first place to go.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.780]   However, one of my favorite sites
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:15.680]   for searching for flight availability is seats.arrow,
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.040]   and they just launched in beta rooms.arrow.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.360]   And if you go to that site, they don't support IHG,
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.880]   but they have Hilton, they have Hyatt,
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.160]   they have Bariat, and it's really good
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.840]   if you're really open to anything.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.940]   You're like, I want a really great property,
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:37.060]   I'm flexible where I stay, flexible on my dates especially,
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:40.400]   and they'll show you options across everything.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.360]   So they basically index all the stays at all the hotels
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.880]   and have a big database you can filter on.
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.320]   So you really need flexibility there,
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:52.560]   or you need to be kind of enjoy filtering big databases.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.560]   And on that, if you want to sign up
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.560]   and support the show, you can go
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.920]   to allthehacks.com/seatsarrow, A-E-R-O,
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.320]   that's my affiliate link.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:05.320]   Two other sites, staywithpoints.com and maxmypoint.com.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.560]   Both of them are tools to be able to set alerts
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.880]   and then also find availability at very specific properties.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.320]   So this is great if you're like,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.300]   I want to stay at the Ventana in Big Sur,
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.640]   and I just wanna see what's happening.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.280]   You can do that same search on Aways and rooms.arrow,
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.040]   but this is their sole purpose.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.840]   But the big thing they do is they allow you to send alerts.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.200]   So if there's a place you wanna stay
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.140]   and you wanna set up an alert so you get notified
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:31.140]   when it opens up, you can do that there.
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:33.900]   Stay With Points has a better UI,
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.600]   but when I was looking at a few examples,
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.440]   it seemed that their availability was less accurate.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.160]   I probably won't let the UI win in that case.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.260]   And Max My Point, in my opinion,
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:47.640]   had a very outdated older UI, but at least worked.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.640]   And you can get your first alert free
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.800]   and with referral links, you can get more.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.540]   And so if you wanna help me out
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.840]   and give me access to these tools,
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.920]   you can use our referral links for any of these,
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:01.240]   allthehacks.com/seatsarrow, allthehacks.com/maxmypoint.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.920]   And like I said earlier, allthehacks.com/aways with a Z.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.600]   So those are some of the tools.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.200]   I'll do a much bigger deep dive on how to search for
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.920]   and book hotels with points,
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.240]   but I just wanted to flag those
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.520]   'cause I've been starting to play with them a bit more.
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.080]   I hope that's super helpful for you guys
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.600]   to plan and book your next trip to Mexico.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.880]   I wanna hear about it because it's awesome.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.000]   And I might actually partner with every person I do
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.720]   one of these country episodes on
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.200]   to plan future All The Hacks trips.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.400]   So the URL is still a little focused on the Iceland trip
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.440]   we're planning for next year.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.360]   But if you go to allthehacks.com/iceland,
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.320]   there's a survey there.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.680]   Even if you're not interested in Iceland
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.840]   and you really just wanna go to Mexico or Japan,
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.240]   you can go fill that out and let us know.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.720]   And that's kind of a good opportunity
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.160]   for us to learn what people are looking for
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.960]   so we can plan some of these trips
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.280]   for listeners and readers and subscribers.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.040]   All right, that's all we got this week.
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.760]   If you need anything, podcast@allthehacks.com
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.280]   and we will see you next week.
