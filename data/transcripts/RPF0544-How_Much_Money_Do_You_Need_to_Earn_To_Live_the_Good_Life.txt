[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.400]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.080]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.840]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.440]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I am your host.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.440]   Today I want to talk with you more about your income and give you some ideal targets for
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.080]   the type of income that you should target.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:10.320]   I am embarrassed to hear about very capable people who aim low on their income.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.160]   I understand it intellectually and emotionally.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.840]   I especially understand it if you're working in a career you don't like or you're in
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.240]   a job you don't like.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.600]   I've been there, done that.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   And I get that.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.880]   And so there's a tendency to focus in and say, "Well, how can I lower my expenses
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880]   as much as possible?"
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.160]   But over the years of Radical Personal Finance, I've done a series of shows trying to confront
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.540]   this problem, especially for young men, to say, "You should have ambition to increase
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.040]   your income."
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.400]   I tell you again, you should have ambition to increase your income.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.680]   If you don't have ambition to increase your income, why not?
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.840]   There are a few mental problems that cause people not to have ambition to increase their
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.840]   income.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   Sometimes, people say, "Well, if I'm earning a lot of money, then I'm going to hurt other
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   people."
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.040]   Well, if you're earning a lot of money by killing or raping or murdering or looting
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.360]   other people, because killing and murdering are the same thing, but you get the point,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.600]   yes, that's kind of a problem.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.480]   We don't want to do that.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.080]   But if you're earning a lot of money by serving more people, that service is good.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:43.600]   The people who serve me in my life and serve me well deserve to do well.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.240]   I want the people that serve me to do well.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.520]   I want the servant who provides food for me in a restaurant to earn a lot of money.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.240]   I want that chef to earn a lot of money for that great dish that they created.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.760]   I want that server who brought the food to my table and kept my water glass full.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.200]   I want them to do well.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.440]   I want everybody who serves me to prosper.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.920]   I want my servant who cuts my grass to prosper.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.480]   I want my servant who cleans my teeth to prosper.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.600]   I want my servant who cracks my back to prosper.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.560]   Because the more they prosper, the better service they'll give to me.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.340]   You want me to prosper.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.960]   Because the more I prosper, the better service I can provide to you.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   I'm very gratified.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.680]   So many listeners have written to me over the years and said, "Joshua, we want to make
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.160]   sure you're still around in 10 years.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   We like what you're doing."
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160]   Well, guess what?
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.800]   If I don't make a lot of money doing what I'm doing here for you on Radical Personal
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.160]   Finance, I ain't going to do it.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.920]   Or at least I ain't going to do it the way that I'm doing it now.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.280]   I made a lot of money as a financial planner.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.000]   That path is easy.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.560]   Rich people love to pay other servants to help them make more money.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.720]   I would be very satisfied to go back to that business.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.740]   Now I have a mission that goes beyond just simply working with one particular family,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.480]   but I'll tell you what.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.400]   I keep my tentacles connected.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.520]   I keep my options open.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.720]   I haven't burned all my bridges.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.600]   I've burned a lot of them, but I haven't burned them all.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.200]   Why?
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.480]   Because I want to prosper.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.600]   I want to get rich, and I'm going to get rich through service.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.620]   Now my personal plan, in case you're curious, my personal plan is to get rich by serving
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.840]   lots and lots of people, but I can also get rich by what I would do now if I were to go
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.160]   back in the financial planning industry.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.560]   I would go and work for a single family or a small multifamily office, and I would get
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.720]   rich by serving one rich family.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.960]   That's what I would do.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.920]   It would fit me.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.880]   So you should have an ambition to increase your income.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.080]   It'll be good for you.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.480]   It'll be good for the people that you serve.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.280]   It'll be good for the people that you love.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.080]   But very rarely do people sit down and figure out, "Well, how much income do I need to make
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.140]   to live the good life?"
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.560]   Very rarely do people sit down and actually set a target.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.800]   So I want to give you some goals today.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.720]   I don't love to do this, but I've changed my mind.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.400]   I used to say, "What are your goals?
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   What are your goals?
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   I'll just listen.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   I'll just listen.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   What are your goals?
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   You tell me about them."
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.320]   But I've learned that a lot of people don't have goals, and it's useful to have goals.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.000]   I've learned that a lot of people, especially young men, just kind of wander from one thing
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.720]   to another.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.480]   Years ago, I worked with a young man who was thinking about getting married.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.000]   He was not earning much money.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.720]   I think at the time he was working as a valet.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.000]   I sat down with him and I said, "Let's make a budget, and let's figure out how much money
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.160]   you need to earn to be able to support a family."
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.480]   Well that process opened his eyes.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.680]   I want to talk to you about some different levels of income by talking with you about
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.880]   some different lifestyles that are available to you.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.160]   Let's start with a minimum wage income.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.300]   Now one of my favorite shows that I have ever done on Radical Personal Finance, and one
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.680]   of the more popular ones, is a show that I did called "How I Would Become a Millionaire
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.320]   Working a Minimum Wage Job at Walmart."
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.720]   If you haven't listened to it, you are underprivileged.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:48.560]   I would recommend you go back and listen to episode 43 from August 15, 2014.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.600]   August 15, 2014, I published that show.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.160]   Number 43 is called "My Plan for How I Would Become a Millionaire with a Minimum Wage Job
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.240]   at Walmart."
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240]   Very popular.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   I'm really proud of it.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.040]   I think it was still a good show.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.840]   But the very thing that I led with was saying the first thing I would do is not work a minimum
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.280]   wage job at Walmart, because the way you get rich is not by earning a minimum wage.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.040]   But I showed how you could build wealth on a minimum wage job at Walmart if you were
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   very careful.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.000]   So let's break down that income.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.280]   In the United States of America, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.200]   Some states have higher minimum wages.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.600]   Some cities have higher minimum wages.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.400]   And I don't know of an area, although I bet they do exist, perhaps a very rural small
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.320]   town area, I don't know of an area in the United States where an employer could get
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.900]   a decent employee for a minimum wage.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.600]   When I hire immigrant, non-skilled laborers here locally where I live in South Florida,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.520]   the going rate right now is $12 an hour or $11 an hour if you're hiring at 11 a.m.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.160]   But very rarely will an unskilled immigrant laborer work for less than $12 an hour where
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.720]   I live.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.760]   $7.25 an hour if you work a 40-hour workweek.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.880]   And at this level, you need to work 52 weeks per year.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.240]   You probably need to do a lot more than 40 hours a week.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.900]   But your gross wage on a minimum wage job would be $15,000 per year.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:18.280]   So minimum wage, $7.25 an hour is $15,000 per year.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:25.200]   Now at this particular level of income, you would pay $0 in taxes.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.840]   Now of course you do have employment taxes.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.000]   Remember that when you are working in a job in the United States of America, you pay employment
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   taxes.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.880]   The employee share of the employment taxes is 7.65% or $1,150 per year of that $15,000
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.120]   income.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.960]   But at this level of income, you pay no federal income taxes.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:53.300]   And I'm going to ignore the employment tax cost because that employment tax cost would
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.040]   be offset by other extant tax credits such as the earned income tax credit or perhaps
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.840]   various welfare benefits that you would be eligible for.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.080]   So let's assume that you pay $0 in taxes.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.240]   On a $15,000 budget, if your ambition is to give away 10% of your income, that means that
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:17.200]   you can give $1,500 per year to others who are in need.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.340]   If your ambition is to save 10% of your income, on a $15,000 budget, you can save $1,500 per
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.120]   year.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.140]   Between your giving and your saving, you've now allocated $3,000 of your budget and you
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:39.340]   are left with $12,000 per year, $1,000 per month to use to arrange your living expenses.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:45.060]   Now if that budget, we take 30% of that budget and we allocate it towards housing, that means
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:52.040]   you can afford a $300 a month house or housing arrangement.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.580]   If 10% of your income, which is a normal number, is dedicated towards utilities, you have $100
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:04.440]   a month available for utilities, water, electricity, phone, internet.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:10.180]   If you allocate 15% of your budget toward transportation, that leaves you with $150
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:14.500]   per month for transportation.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.460]   Car payment, gas, insurance, etc.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:25.780]   If you allocate 15% of your income for food, you have $150 per month available for your
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.780]   food.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:32.820]   5% of your budget allocated towards health and medical expenses, that leaves you with
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.940]   $50 per month.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.820]   If you set a 5% entertainment budget, you have $50 per month, which leaves you with
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:45.580]   20% of your budget available for miscellaneous expenses, about $200 per month.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:53.780]   Friends, that's doable for a single person who's very flexible or for a young person
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.260]   or an old person who has a strong family support network.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:06.100]   It's not really doable for anybody else.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:12.220]   My scorecard for this particular level of income is your giving potential is limited.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.780]   If you give $1,500 per year over the course of a 40-year career, you'll be able to give
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.060]   away about $60,000.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.340]   That's good, but I call that limited.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.820]   Your wealth building potential, it's tough to build wealth.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.400]   Doable but tough, and the potential is very limited.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.520]   If you're investing $1,500 per year for 40 years at a 5% rate of return, you'll wind
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.860]   up with about $181,000 portfolio at the end of 40 years.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.500]   It's not bad, but it certainly is limited.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.460]   Your lifestyle potential on a minimum wage job is very limited.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:58.680]   Again, it may be possible to support an individual, especially a very skilled individual who is
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.960]   very good at living on the fringes of society.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:08.780]   But it's not possible to support a family on a minimum wage job.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.580]   If you are unemployed, your first goal should be to become employed.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.460]   You will become employed at a minimum wage level at the very least.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:23.860]   But if you are working a minimum wage job, your first goal should be to stop working
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:31.440]   a minimum wage job and to start making more because it's limited.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.460]   You're limited in your ability to give, you're limited in your ability to build wealth, and
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.940]   your lifestyle potential is very limited.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:47.540]   Your target should be to move from a minimum wage job to a median wage job.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:55.940]   Now, of course, the median, that term means that 50% of households earn more than that
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.960]   and 50% of households earn less than that.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.920]   So when looking at something like income, the median wages or the median lifestyle is
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.260]   a very useful metric.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:12.060]   It's more useful than the mean or average income or average level of expenses.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:19.720]   In the United States of America in 2016, the US median wage was $59,039.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.900]   You'll forgive me if I just call it $59,000 here among friends.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:28.880]   At this level of income, your annual taxes would be about $9,000.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.700]   You would have about $4,500 of employment taxes and about $4,500 of income taxes on
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.560]   a $59,000 per year job.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.720]   That leaves you with $50,000 after taxes.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.040]   Assume that you establish a 10% giving budget, that leaves you with the ability to give away
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.000]   $5,000 per year.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.200]   You establish a 10% savings budget, that leaves you with the ability to save $5,000 per year.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.880]   The remainder, $40,000 per year, is going to be allocated toward expenses.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:08.640]   Well, 30% of that $40,000 for housing leaves you with a housing budget of $1,000 a month.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.840]   10% toward utilities leaves you with a utilities budget of $330 per month.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:21.280]   15% of your budget for transportation leaves you with $500 per month for transportation.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.640]   15% for food leaves you with $500 a month for food.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.560]   5% for health and medical is $160 a month.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.800]   5% for entertainment, $160 per month.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:39.120]   And you have an additional 20% slush fund for miscellaneous expenses of $650 per month.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.360]   Now think about those numbers, $1,000 a month for housing.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:52.640]   In your area, you should be able to find a reasonable place to live that's safe and dry
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.080]   for $1,000 a month.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   $330 a month for utilities.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:03.000]   In your area, you should be able to find a way to pay for electricity and water and internet
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.160]   or phone, cell phone, home phone, et cetera, for $330 a month.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:15.600]   $500 a month for transportation, you should be able to arrange the purchase of a vehicle,
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.240]   insurance and fuel costs on $500 a month.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.400]   $500 a month on food, you should be able to feed yourself and your family on $500 a month
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.800]   of food.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:32.600]   Health and medical, $160 a month for dental expenses, vitamin supplements, gym, et cetera,
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   doable.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.760]   Entertainment, $160 a month, adequate.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   Gives you $2,000 a year to spend on a family vacation or various entertainment options
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   if that's what you want to do.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.640]   And an additional $8,000 per year or $650 a month for miscellaneous expenses.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.040]   Here's how I rate this particular level of income.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.560]   Giving potential is effective.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.640]   If you give away $5,000 per year for 40 years, you'll give away $200,000.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.280]   Wealth building potential, I call that moderate.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:06.280]   If you invest $5,000 per year for 40 years at a 5% mean rate of return, you'll wind
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.560]   up with $600,000 in your portfolio after 40 years.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.160]   Lifestyle potential, I call it adequate.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.560]   It's possible to support a family at this particular level of income.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:23.960]   And with wise spending choices, I believe you could live in reasonable comfort.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.920]   Wouldn't call it luxury, but I would call it reasonable comfort.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:36.380]   The more skillful you are in allocating money and in managing expenses, the better.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.000]   But lifestyle potential here is adequate.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.680]   So if you are on a minimum wage job, you should target moving to a median wage job.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.320]   Now your next target is to move to the top 20% of income earners.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:59.160]   I'm convinced that every one of you listening to this show can move into the top 20% of
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   income earners.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.480]   I don't believe that everybody in society can move into the top 20% of income earners
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:11.240]   because obviously, mathematically, if everyone in society moved, it just wouldn't work.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.060]   But more importantly is not everybody in society has adequate cognitive ability.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.280]   Not everyone has adequate skills.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.200]   Not everyone has just adequate physical ability to actually produce enough value to move into
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.360]   the top 20% of income.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:32.120]   But I speak at a very high level, at the very least college if not master's degree level
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.840]   with my vocabulary, the concepts, the way that I speak, et cetera.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.200]   And so if you're listening to my voice now and if you're understanding what I'm saying,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:47.960]   if you're grasping at least the basis of these concepts, you have sufficient cognitive ability
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:59.080]   and sufficient motivation and sufficient vocabulary, sufficient practical tools to move into the
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.560]   top 20% of income earners.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:10.400]   In the United States, if you look at the total level of income, according to the 2016 reports
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:20.920]   from census.gov, the 80th percentile limit of income is $121,018.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:29.920]   So if you want to move into the top 20% of income, you should target $121,000 per year
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.720]   as your annual income.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.360]   Now why is this important?
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:44.920]   Because the top 20% of income earners earn 80% of the money.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:51.160]   Most things in life seem to be distributed according to a Pareto distribution, 20/80.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:59.480]   So the top 20% of income earners actually earn 80% of the money available.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:07.400]   Whereas the bottom 80% of income earners earn only 20% of the money available.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:13.200]   Picture flows of revenue and income like a giant river.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.660]   There are some people that go into that river with a little tiny teaspoon.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.600]   There are some people that take a bucket.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.800]   And there are some people that build a pipeline.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.120]   I think you could imagine that if there are some people with a teaspoon and some people
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:37.360]   with a pipeline taking water out of that river, now you can see why 20% of the income earners
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.840]   earn 80% of the income.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:48.040]   Now the cool thing about it is nobody has to take a teaspoon.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.440]   Nobody has to take a pipeline.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.160]   Some people come to the river with their teaspoon, they dip out a little bit of water, they put
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.920]   it in their mouth and they go away.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.800]   Some people come to the river with a teaspoon, they dip out a little water, they fill their
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.000]   mouth and they start filling up buckets.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.600]   And they take those buckets, they sell it to other people that didn't want to walk to
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.640]   the river with their teaspoon.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.560]   They make a profit, they come back and they put more money in the buckets, they keep selling
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.960]   the buckets to other people.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.240]   Then when they have enough money, they build a pipeline.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.800]   That's how money works.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.740]   The cool thing about it is those options are available to you.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.000]   But you got to start that process.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.880]   You take your teaspoon to the river, you slake your thirst, that's what we've talked about
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:32.340]   with minimum wage jobs, and you start tucking away water to sell to other people.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.340]   You rent out your money.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.820]   That's called investing.
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.760]   You rent out your money to other people who want to use that money.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.120]   That's how you build wealth.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.560]   You develop your skills, you invest in your own tools.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.440]   You take your teaspoon, you rent somebody else's bucket, you fill it with water, you
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.600]   take that bucket and you sell it to them.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.760]   Then you buy a teaspoon from somebody else, so you have two teaspoons now, so you can
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.000]   fill your bucket twice as fast.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.200]   Then you sell that bucket and you come back and you buy a little cup.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.520]   You take the cup and you put it into the bucket and you sell your bucket now about five times
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.700]   as fast.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.840]   That's how money works.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.880]   That's how wealth building works.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:14.520]   You take what you have, your physical ability to dip water out of the river, you take whatever
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.120]   tools are at your disposal and you figure out how to use those tools to sell to other
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.160]   people, sell the product to other people who are either too lazy or too rich to go and
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.320]   get their own water.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.080]   And then in time, you expand your capacity and your capability.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.800]   So you, because you are listening to this, you've already demonstrated sufficient motivation,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.760]   sufficient cognitive ability to move from the bottom 80% of income earners to the top
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.360]   20% of income earners in time.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.860]   It takes time to fill a bucket with a teaspoon.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.600]   It takes time to go and sell that water.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.960]   Takes time to fill a bucket with a cup.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.360]   Takes time to sell that water.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.660]   It takes time to fill a bucket with a hose and sell that water.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.920]   It takes time to buy more buckets, takes time to buy a truck, and it takes time and money
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.460]   to build a pipeline.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.100]   But it's doable.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.940]   Top 20% of income, $121,000 per year.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.960]   At this level of earnings, your taxes would be about $21,000 per year.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.320]   Of course, you would have $9,000 of employment taxes.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.080]   Here we're still near the Social Security wage base, so still about 7.65% for employment
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.680]   taxes.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.360]   And your income taxes, if we assume that you save about $10,000 in an IRA or qualified
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.520]   plan, a loose estimate of your income taxes here would be about $12,000 per year.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:48.920]   So on $121,000 income, you're going to pay $21,000 in taxes.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.240]   You set aside 10% of your income for giving to others who are in need.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.000]   That's $10,000 per year.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.940]   You save 10% of your income.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.600]   That's $10,000 per year.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.960]   The remaining 80% of your income is allocated towards expenses.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.760]   That gives you a budget of $80,000 per year.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.280]   30% of that goes to housing, $2,000 a month.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.920]   As I go through these numbers, think about your area and what's available in your area.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.120]   What kind of house can you rent for $2,000 per month?
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.480]   10% goes towards utilities, $650 per month.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.520]   Is that adequate for the utilities in your area for a $2,000 a month house?
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.080]   15% goes to transportation.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:40.480]   That gives you a budget of $1,000 a month between cars, car payment, insurance, gas,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.360]   et cetera.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.500]   15% is allocated towards food.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.180]   That gives you a food budget of $1,000 a month.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.440]   You're starting to move out of basic and into luxury.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.880]   You can afford the fancier cuts of meat.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.060]   You can afford more organic produce.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:02.120]   You can afford a little bit more eating out, a fine restaurant from that time to time.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.820]   Health and medical at 5%, that's $330 a month.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.720]   You can afford some better nutritional supplements.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.860]   You can afford a higher quality medical practitioner.
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.880]   You can afford to be on the chiropractor's normal monthly plan.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.280]   5% is allocated towards entertainment.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.200]   That gives you a budget of $4,000 per year or $330 per month.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.120]   We still have a 20% miscellaneous expense slush fund.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.000]   Comes out to about $1,300 per month.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.200]   My scorecard on this level of income.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.160]   Giving potential is effective.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:44.040]   $10,000 given per year over 40 years is almost half a million dollars, $400,000 given away.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.400]   Wealth building potential, effective.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.000]   $10,000 per year invested over 40 years at a 5% rate of return equals a portfolio value
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.160]   of $1.2 million.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.000]   And your lifestyle potential here is excellent.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.400]   It's possible for you to support a family in comfort.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.300]   You're able to consume the higher grade products and services.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:12.000]   And there's plenty of wiggle room, especially if you're a skilled spender.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.200]   I've known a lot of people with $121,000 income who don't feel rich, but that's because they
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.500]   were mediocre spenders.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.740]   All they know how to do is write checks and swipe cards and not how to get a good value
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.220]   for their money.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.140]   You can fix that, and we'll fix that another time when I talk to you about a decreased
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.060]   expenses course in the future.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:42.620]   Your target at the minimum should be to move into the top 20% of your occupation of income
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.620]   earners.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:52.700]   I bet if you will analyze your industry, the top 20% of income earners earn at least $121,000
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.060]   per year.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:02.580]   I've known a lot of guys in the trades, blue collar trades, who've earned $120,000 a year.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:07.980]   There are some occupations that are, of course, tilted higher, in which case the top 20% of
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.860]   that occupation is much higher.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.140]   But on the whole, $121,000 a year is top 20%.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:22.160]   You should set that as a target and make a plan to achieve it quickly.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:33.780]   Give me a 15-year-old young man with good cognitive ability, strong work ethic, basic
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:40.160]   social skills, and strong personal ethics.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   All of those are important.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.120]   Again, I repeat, good cognitive ability.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.920]   You have to be able to process abstract concepts.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.180]   If you're in an industry where you can't process the abstract concepts of your industry, move
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.520]   to one where you can.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:03.800]   But give me a 15-year-old man with good cognitive ability, personal skills, personal interaction
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:13.680]   skills, a good work ethic, and personal integrity and personal ethics.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.080]   He's not going to steal from his boss.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.320]   He's not going to be ripping off his boss because he's hanging out on Facebook on the
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.560]   clock.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:30.600]   Give me a 15-year-old young man or woman and give me the industry, and in five to 10 years,
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:37.760]   we can go from minimum wage to top 20% of $120,000.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.680]   I can do it in the trades, and so can you.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.800]   If you're not in the trades, there are many options for you.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.600]   What else should you target as a goal?
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.760]   Well, I think you should move into the top 5%.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:00.320]   In a parade of distribution, the 20/80 continues to function.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.000]   So if you look at an analysis of income earners in the United States of America, the top 20%
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:22.280]   of income earners earn 80% of the total income, but in the top 20%, the same case exists.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:30.680]   So in the top 20%, the top 20% of the top 20% earn 80% of the top 20% of income, or
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.480]   about 64% of total income.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:40.240]   And then the top 20% of the top 20% of the top 20% earn 80%, et cetera, and it goes on,
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.480]   which is why if you work the numbers, I can't remember the latest analysis, you wind up
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.280]   with a dozen.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.960]   You wind up with a couple hundred people in the world that own, what is it, 30%, 40% of
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:54.440]   all the assets, or you wind up with a couple of dozen who own 20% of all the assets.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440]   You wind up with this.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.520]   It's the same Pareto principle on and on.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.080]   I don't know if everybody can go from the bottom 80% to the top 20.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.520]   No, sorry, let me rephrase.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:12.200]   I believe that you, not everybody can go from the bottom 80% to the top 20%, but you can.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   I don't know if you can go from the bottom 80% of the top 20% into the top 20% of the
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.560]   top 20%, which is basically the top 4% or 5%, but I think you can.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.560]   I don't know if you should make it your ambition to go higher.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.840]   I personally don't have any ambition to be the number one person in my field.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.520]   I used to set that as a goal.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.400]   When I was a financial planner, I would run the numbers and I would figure out what it
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:43.880]   meant to be the top, the very top, but the price was always too high.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.880]   When I calculated what would be necessary in order for me to achieve that, I decided
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.600]   that the juice wasn't worth the squeeze.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   The price was too high.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.360]   So you can't fake it.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   You can't get there by accident.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.440]   The people who are at the very top have sacrificed other areas of their life, and I came to the
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.160]   realization that I wasn't willing to sacrifice like they did.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.300]   Wasn't worth it.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:13.040]   But moving into the top 5% total is probably doable and is probably adequate for most people.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:21.240]   Now in the United States, the 95th percentile of income is $225,251 according to the 2016
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   census data.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:29.000]   It wasn't the 2016 census, but from the census bureaus where I'm citing and sourcing my figures.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.760]   So let's call it $225,000 per year.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:40.120]   I think you should set as your target to earn $225,000 per year in your occupation.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.680]   Now what will that buy you?
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:50.780]   Well at a $225,000 income, you'll pay about $50,000 per year in taxes.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.080]   Your employment taxes would be about $11,150.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:01.580]   We would max out the social security wage base, a total social security tax of $7,886
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:08.800]   and the Medicare tax of $3,262, or a total employment tax of $11,150.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.280]   By the way, if these numbers are making your head spin and you want to see them written,
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:18.520]   I am speaking to you very loosely from a module in the Increase Income course.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.980]   Arsenalfinance.com/increaseincome on sale right now.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.940]   Talk to you about that in a moment when I'm done.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.580]   But I'm reading to you from a module.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.580]   All of this is written down.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.840]   All of this is part of your notes in that particular module.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.780]   My presentation in that module is much tighter, more edited.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.600]   This particular presentation I'm giving to you now is more free form, but this is one
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.860]   of the modules in that course with all the numbers.
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:47.380]   So employment taxes on a $225,000 per year salary would be just over 11 grand and your
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.040]   income taxes would be about $39,000.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.260]   That's just a loose estimate.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.100]   I'm assuming $20,000 in qualified plan contributions and two dependents.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.940]   For a total taxes of about $50,000 per year.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:03.420]   That leaves you with $175,000 available after taxes.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.740]   Assume that you give 10% of your income away.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:11.260]   That leaves you with $17,500 per year in your giving budget.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:17.120]   Now here in your savings, let's bump it up from that standard 10% number we've been
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.000]   using to 20%.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   After all, at this level of earnings, significantly increased savings should easily be available
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.220]   without sacrificing lifestyle.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.140]   So let's move up your savings from 10% to 20%.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:38.240]   That's a total of $35,000 per year saved.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.640]   We're left with 70% for expenses or $122,500 per year.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.820]   Let's call it 10 grand a month.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:51.280]   If 30% of that is allocated towards housing, we've got $3,000 a month.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:56.080]   What kind of house can you rent in your town for $3,000 a month?
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.620]   If 10% is for utilities, we've got $1,000 per month.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:07.480]   Can you meet all of your utility needs in abundance on $1,000 a month for a $3,000 house?
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:14.180]   If 15% is allocated toward transportation, we've got $1,500 a month.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:19.000]   Can you meet your transportation needs in luxury on $1,500 a month?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.060]   15% is allocated towards food, that's $1,500 a month.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:31.760]   Can you meet your nutrient needs in luxury on $1,500 a month?
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.040]   Health and medical 5%, $500 a month.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:42.400]   Entertainment 5%, and we're left with a 20% or $2,000 a month miscellaneous expense slush
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.480]   fund for other expenses.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.200]   How do I rate this particular level of income?
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.160]   Well, giving potential is excellent.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:58.120]   If you give away $17,500 per year for 40 years, you would give away $700,000, three-quarters
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.080]   of a million dollars.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.680]   I would rate here your wealth-building potential as excellent.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:12.260]   If you invest $35,000 per year for 40 years at a 5% interest rate, you would wind up with
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.640]   a portfolio value of $4.2 million.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.040]   I call that excellent.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.960]   And your lifestyle potential here is excellent.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:29.120]   It's possible for you to support family and even extended family in luxury and comfort.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.440]   You'll be able to consume the highest grades of products and services.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:42.000]   There's plenty of monthly surplus for spontaneous expenditures and adventures.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.620]   This is the land of abundance.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.980]   The land of abundance is found in the top 5%.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:35:02.860]   Excellent giving potential, excellent wealth-building potential, and excellent lifestyle potential.
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:09.000]   So in conclusion, the best way for you to be able to give a lot of money away, to become
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.740]   enormously wealthy, and to enjoy a rich and rewarding lifestyle every year of your career
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.660]   is for you to build a high income.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:24.620]   A high income allows you to do all of these well.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:30.560]   So target the top 5% of income earners for your personal income.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:36.740]   Target $225,000 per year.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:43.220]   You don't have to earn $225,000 per year in order to live well.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:47.460]   I give this to you as a goal and to stimulate your thinking.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:55.500]   As I've shown, minimum wage is meager, median wage is adequate, top 20% is good, and top
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.380]   5% is excellent.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.980]   If you'll set these as a goal, you'll be open to the ways to get there.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:08.340]   Again, I emphasize, I didn't use the top 1%.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.900]   Sometimes you got to sell your soul to the devil to get into the top 1%.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.340]   Sometimes you got to live at the office to get into the top 1%.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.300]   I don't think that's a good plan.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   But you can live well on 5% because of the money that comes in, and you can find a position
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:41.220]   in the top 5% that gives you enough income to live well.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:50.260]   If you'd like my help in working with you to create a plan for you, I'd love for you
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:56.900]   to join the Radical Personal Finance Increase Income course that I have open right now.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.820]   The launch window here is open for a total of four weeks.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:09.620]   Today is Thursday, May 10, and registration for this course will be open until Wednesday,
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.860]   June 6.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:16.060]   However, if you buy today, you will save money.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:21.620]   Each week that goes by, I'm increasing the cost of the course by $100.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:27.260]   So you are still, right now, if you're listening to this, you are still in the cheapest opening
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.260]   price.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:34.860]   The opening price right now is $395 for the course, and it will be $395 until Tuesday,
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:40.740]   end of day, Tuesday, May 15.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   What are you going to get in the course?
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:46.820]   Well, there's 104 video lessons that I've prepared using concepts like these to try
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:54.780]   to give you an abundance of ideas that you can apply to your own situation.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:59.340]   In addition, there are weekly and sometimes bi-weekly conference calls where you can speak
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:04.620]   to me and to other students, and we will personally work with you to help you apply ideas to your
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.140]   own situation.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.780]   There's guidance on things that you can put into place in your current career.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.500]   There's guidance on how to switch to a new career.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.220]   If you look at your career and say, "I can't earn $225,000 on my career," well, you might
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.340]   need to change.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.820]   But you can take what you love about that career and move it into something else or
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:31.000]   split your time.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.500]   In addition, there are...
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.220]   It's a comment section, and I'm interacting heavily during the first 12 weeks of the course.
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.380]   I'm interacting heavily with you there in the comments, answering every question, interacting
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.900]   with you on all of the details to try to give you customized support.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.300]   And then depending on your questions, if there's something that you have a question on that
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.460]   I haven't hit well in the videos, the 104 lessons that are already there, I may make
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.460]   a custom video for you.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.460]   So I'd love for you to join me.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.340]   If this has been inspiring to you, I'd love for you to join me.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.260]   Now I want you to think about this for a moment.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:07.120]   Let's pretend for a moment that I could serve you effectively in this area.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.660]   Pretend that I could help you to develop strategies and ideas that will help you increase your
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.460]   income.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.340]   Pretend that we could increase your income by 10%.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:26.380]   Calculate in your head what a 10% increase in income would be for you in the next year
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:31.060]   or two.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:40.460]   Would it be worth investing a measly 395 bucks to increase your income by 10%?
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.140]   What about 50%?
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.020]   What about 100%?
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.100]   My hope is that your investment in this course will return to you untold multiples throughout
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.200]   your lifetime.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.820]   Because if we can move you from these lower levels of income into the upper levels of
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:03.740]   income, that'll do powerful things for you, for your family, for your wealth, for your
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.180]   community.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:10.320]   So if you're interested, I'd love for you to come by radicalpersonalfinance.com/increaseincome.

[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.340]   If for any reason in the first 30 days you look at the course and you say, "This isn't
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.340]   for me.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.340]   Not learning thing.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.340]   Not helpful."
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.340]   Whatever reason.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.340]   You don't even have to give me a reason.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.340]   Send me an email.

[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.340]   None of that nonsense.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.340]   100% refund for you.
