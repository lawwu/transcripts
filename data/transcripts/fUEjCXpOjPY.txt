[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   we have been encouraged culturally to criticize
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.480]   people we're in long-term relationships with.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.840]   Not new relationships, new relationships,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.360]   put the person on a pedestal,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.520]   you're allowed to just, oh, they're wonderful.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.120]   But every trope out there in every form of popular media
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.680]   is like the wife rolling her eyes at the husband
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.600]   and the husband being like,
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.680]   oh, there's loathsome Harpy that castrated me.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.360]   As if like people are just passive players in their lives.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.120]   And I think that is an incredibly toxic message
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.960]   to send to people,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.320]   that this is how we should be relating to our partner.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.360]   Like we should not,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.360]   you don't take the piss out of your partner
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.360]   in front of people.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.240]   Like the successful relationships I've seen
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.280]   are where people are just cheering for their partner,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.840]   where they are thick as thieves,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.560]   where there is just this feeling of like,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.800]   man, they like each other.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.640]   Like they got each other's back,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.600]   like you wouldn't believe.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.840]   Like man, you could take sides against anybody,
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.920]   but take sides against their partner, you're going down.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.280]   Like, and that, when you see a couple that has that,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.040]   you just, you know, that's so hard to break.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.040]   But I think that comes from having like a steadfast,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.280]   yeah, no, I don't do that.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.880]   Like I don't shit talk my partner.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.000]   Like, and you don't shit talk my partner to me.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600]   You know, like, and that to me is,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.120]   because I think we're just so criticized by the world.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.680]   The world is so full of criticism.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.000]   We criticize ourselves so harshly
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.080]   that having a partner who no matter what is like,
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.440]   you've got this, I'm with you.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.240]   Like you fuck, okay, yeah, you screwed up.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.080]   I see it.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.640]   Look, I'm not gonna lie to you about your blind spots.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.480]   You screwed up, but you know what?
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.680]   People screw up sometimes.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.520]   You got a right to screw up.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.400]   A lot of people screw up.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.680]   Come on, get up, let's go.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.000]   I know you have it in you.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.400]   If you have that person, like,
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.480]   I feel like that's a superpower.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.720]   (air whooshing)
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.280]   - The following is a conversation with James Sexton,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.240]   divorce attorney and author of "How to Stay in Love,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.080]   A Divorce Lawyer's Guide to Staying Together."
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   As a trial lawyer, James for over two decades
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.320]   has negotiated and litigated
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.960]   a huge number of high conflict divorces.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.520]   This has given him a deep understanding
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.120]   of how relationships fail and how they can succeed.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.760]   And bigger than that, the role of love and pain
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.040]   in this whole messy rollercoaster ride we call life.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.920]   This is the Alex Friedman Podcast.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.080]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.440]   in the description.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.960]   And now, dear friends, here's James Sexton.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.200]   What is the most common reason that marriages fail?
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.440]   - That's a great question, but it's a question
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.480]   that everybody wants there to be a simple answer.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.240]   Like, they want me to say cheating or money
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720]   or, you know, the internet.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   But the reality is, I think it's a lot of little things.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.440]   It's disconnection, that would be my answer.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.000]   The reason marriages fail is disconnection.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.600]   What causes disconnection?
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.320]   That's the bigger and I think more important question
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.600]   because like Tom Wolfe said about bankruptcy,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.880]   it happens very slowly and then all at once.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.480]   Disconnection happens very slowly and then all at once.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.040]   So most of the time what I think people want
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.040]   is an answer like cheating.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.720]   But cheating is the big all at once thing.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.680]   How did we get to the place where cheating
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.920]   was even something you were thinking about doing
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.280]   or that you would think about and then cross the line
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.160]   from thought into action?
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.400]   And that's, I think, the big question.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.000]   So disconnection would be my answer.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.320]   - Do you think it's possible to introspect,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.840]   like looking backwards for every individual case
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.360]   where the disconnection began and how it evolved?
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.400]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.240]   This is such a multivariate equation.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.880]   It's a dance, it's a chemistry.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.680]   What did you do and what did the other person do?
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.040]   And see, the interesting thing about being a divorce lawyer
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.160]   is I'm weaponizing intimacy in a courtroom.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.280]   So I'm telling, it's full context storytelling,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.520]   what I do for a living.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.440]   So what I do is I take my client's story
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.520]   and I have to present it to a judge
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.560]   and make my client the hero in every way
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.640]   and the other side the villain in every way.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.120]   Now I have to be careful not to do that
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.360]   in a manner that loses credibility
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.120]   because even a judge would know,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.640]   even a judge is smart enough to know
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.520]   that no one's all good or all bad.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.880]   But only if you were reverse engineering a relationship
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.960]   and saying, how did this break?
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.160]   You really have to look at both people,
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.000]   the good and the bad, what each of them did
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.600]   that moved the dial in these different directions.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.440]   And I think that that's very hard
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.320]   for anyone going through a divorce
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   to do about their own relationship.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.800]   We don't know who discovered water, but it wasn't a fish.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   Like if you're in it, I don't think you see it clearly.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.480]   I think as a divorce lawyer,
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.700]   whose job is to really drill down on the facts
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.000]   and figure out what's going on in this story,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   I have to look at both sides.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.040]   So I have to think a lot about my own arguments,
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.920]   but I also have to think about
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.640]   what's the other lawyer's argument going to be,
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.960]   especially in custody cases.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.600]   So I really have been forced to look at both sides
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.880]   for so many years, so deeply in relationships
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.280]   that once you do that, it's very,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.080]   you realize that the good guy, bad guy thing
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.040]   just doesn't apply.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.400]   - I wonder if it's the little things
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.620]   or a few big things that caused this connection,
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.160]   whether it's, I mean, you've talked about
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.800]   granola and blowjobs, but those seem to be stories
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.880]   that you can tell to yourself.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.160]   Maybe that story should be explained, or maybe not.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.240]   - You don't think granola and blowjobs
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.120]   is self-explanatory?
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120]   - Almost.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.760]   I think people can construct a good,
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.120]   like if you ask GPT, what do they mean?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.380]   I think the story that would come up is a pretty good one.
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.280]   But that's a story you tell about when you first knew
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.040]   it's the disconnection has begun,
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.440]   is when he stopped buying my favorite granola
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.200]   or when she stopped giving blowjobs.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.800]   - I would say when it's reached like a critical mass.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.360]   - Yeah, phase shift.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.240]   - Because I think it started before that,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.420]   when she said, "Yeah, I used to give him blowjobs."
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.760]   And when we were in our early relationship,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.080]   and then one day I just was like,
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.960]   "Oh, well, we don't have as much time.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.280]   "I'll wait until later and we'll have sex
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   "and then we both enjoy it."
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.040]   - Blowjobs are inefficient.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.840]   - Yeah, exactly correct.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.680]   - You batch it all together.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.040]   - Yeah, so she said, "Well, exactly."
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.280]   And they had kids at that point,
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.240]   so I think she really was like,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   "Hey, we've gotten a certain window,
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.480]   "so let's have something we both enjoy."
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.920]   So I don't think she had any negative intentions there.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.640]   I think that she was working in good faith
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.440]   towards the betterment of the relationship,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.680]   but it was having this second order effect.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.680]   And so I really do think that,
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.320]   yeah, the blowjobs, granola.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.480]   I mean, anyone who's been in a long-term relationship,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.320]   I guess it's just worth asking the question,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.280]   what does this person do that makes me feel loved?
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.440]   Because I think it's very interesting
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.320]   in my own experience in life.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.520]   Remember, I had a difficult chapter with one of my sons,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.640]   my younger son when he was in his early 20s,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.440]   and we were having a heartfelt conversation.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.160]   And I said to him, "Do you know I love you?"
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.280]   And he said, "Well, yeah, of course I do."
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.240]   I said, "But do you feel my love?
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.120]   "Like, do you feel it?
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.280]   "Not just do you know it intellectually, do you feel it?"
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.600]   And I remember thinking to myself,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.200]   when do we feel someone's love, right?
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.640]   Like, what is it that they do?
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.520]   And sometimes it's the weirdest, silliest things
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.800]   that they would never know.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.520]   They are the person who's showing us that they love us
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.800]   and that we're feeling their love.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.400]   They would never show us.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.800]   Like, if you said, "Why does this person love you?"
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.240]   They wouldn't say, "Oh, 'cause I always make sure
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.840]   "that when the paper comes, I bring it
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   "from the bottom of the driveway to the door
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.880]   "so they don't have to go out and get it."
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.400]   Or, "I always hold the door for them."
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.920]   Or, "I always, like, again, I buy the granola
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.040]   "that I know this person likes."
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.960]   Or, "I remembered that they don't like it
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.680]   "when I put on this particular record,
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.120]   "so I don't put it on."
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.760]   Yes, they're small things, but they're not small.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.080]   They're kind of everything.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.440]   - Do you think it's good to communicate that stuff?
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.840]   - Well, 100%.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.000]   - It takes away some of the power of it, right?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.960]   - When you point it out, then the person realizes,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.840]   "Oh, okay, he likes this or dislikes this."
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.320]   So, yes, there becomes a deliberateness to it,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.080]   you know, a conscious.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.160]   So, I understand not pointing that out
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.840]   when it's a good thing.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.400]   I think when it's a negative thing.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.160]   Like, I think in the granola situation,
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.320]   if she had said to him,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.400]   "Hey, you used to do this and you've stopped.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.640]   "That feels like something to me."
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.680]   Like, she said, she didn't say anything about that,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.800]   just like he probably didn't say anything
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.920]   about the blowjobs.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.320]   Like, I think if there had been a moment of,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.720]   "This is starting, let's talk about it while it's starting."
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.680]   But people wait, from what I can see,
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.600]   people wait until the big thing happens,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.240]   the financial impropriety, the substance use disorder,
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.000]   the cheating, they wait for that to happen,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.120]   and then they go, "Where did we go wrong?"
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.280]   And the answer is, "Quite a while ago, with the granola."
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.000]   - Yeah, yeah, so when you notice something,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.960]   like you notice that little something,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.400]   talk about it.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.240]   'Cause that little something is probably a kernel
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.400]   of a deeper truth.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.120]   Of course, there's also moods.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.000]   We're all like a rollercoaster of emotions,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.320]   so you can not bring a granola one day
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.120]   just because you're in this place
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.760]   where just nothing is, just cynicism everywhere,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.400]   just anger and so on.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.800]   But it's a temporary feeling.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.160]   But maybe that temporary feeling is grounded
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.560]   in some other deeper current that's actually building up.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.280]   - Yeah, and I think a good partner
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.880]   wants to understand the currents of their partner.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.200]   They wanna understand, like,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.680]   "Hey, are you going through something?"
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.360]   And look, if I'm the one you need to take it out on,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.520]   that's okay.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.400]   I'm a big boy.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.720]   I can take it.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.280]   If you're hormonal, if you're frustrated at work,
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.840]   if you're whatever, we should be able
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.520]   to have a little bit of that interaction in a relationship.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.720]   But I do think it's so easy to just say to people,
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.680]   "Oh, communication is the key."
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.400]   But it really is about fearless kinds of communication.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.080]   It's about really honestly saying to somebody,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.800]   "This feels like something to me.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.640]   Am I wrong?
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.520]   Like, this just feels like something to me."
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.000]   And also how that's presented.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I mean, one of the things I'm very caught up on
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.160]   or feel very strongly about
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.480]   is that we have been encouraged culturally
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.160]   to criticize people we're in long-term relationships with.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.120]   Not new relationships.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.080]   New relationships, you put the person on a pedestal,
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.240]   you're allowed to just, "Oh, they're wonderful."
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.840]   But every trope out there in every form of popular media
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.360]   is like the wife rolling her eyes at the husband
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.200]   and the husband being like,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.400]   "Oh, this loathsome harpy that castrated me."
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.080]   As if people are just passive players in their lives.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.840]   And I think that is an incredibly toxic message
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.680]   to send to people,
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.040]   that this is how we should be relating to our partner.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.080]   Like we should not,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.040]   you don't take the piss out of your partner
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.080]   in front of people.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.960]   Like the successful relationships I've seen
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.980]   are where people are just cheering for their partner,
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.560]   where they are thick as thieves,
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.200]   where there is just this feeling of like,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.520]   "Man, they like each other.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.320]   Like they got each other's back like you wouldn't believe.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.520]   Like man, you could take sides against anybody,
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.560]   but take sides against their partner, you're going down."
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.960]   Like, and that, when you see a couple that has that,
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.680]   you just, that's so hard to break.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   But I think that comes from having like a steadfast,
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.920]   "Yeah, no, I don't do that.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.480]   Like I don't shit talk my partner.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   Like, and you don't shit talk my partner to me."
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.200]   You know, like, and that to me is,
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.720]   because I think we're just so criticized by the world.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.280]   The world is so full of criticism.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.600]   We criticize ourselves so harshly
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   that having a partner who no matter what is like,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.040]   "You've got this, I'm with you.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.840]   Like you fuck, okay, yeah, you screwed up.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.680]   I see it.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.240]   Look, I'm not gonna lie to you about your blind spots.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.080]   You screwed up, but you know what?
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.280]   People screw up sometimes.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.120]   You got a right to screw up.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.000]   A lot of people screw up.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.240]   Come on, get up, let's go.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.600]   I know you have it in you."
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.000]   If you have that person, like that,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.920]   I feel like that's a superpower
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.920]   to have that effect on another person.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.000]   - Yeah, one of the things I love seeing,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.220]   when you look at a couple and one is talking,
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.040]   like in an interview, answering a question,
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.520]   especially like intellectual questions,
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.480]   like, "What do you think about the war in Ukraine?"
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.520]   or something, and then the partner is talking,
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.200]   and the other person is looking at them
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.360]   as if they're hearing the wisest thing ever.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.040]   Like they're still looking at them,
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.880]   not waiting for their turn to speak,
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.160]   not thinking about how's the audience going to take that,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.000]   but they're looking at them like,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   "Goddamn, I'm so lucky to be with this smart motherfucker."
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.440]   - But there's a scene-
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.000]   - And they could be saying the dumbest shit ever.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.080]   - There's a scene in the movie "True Romance."
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.920]   - Yes, I love "True Romance."
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.240]   - I love the movie, great movie.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.320]   Gary Oldman scene's like the greatest scene ever done
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.020]   in a film with Christian Slater.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.040]   But there's a scene in it where she holds up a sign
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.200]   to Christian Slater, and it says, "You're so cool."
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.480]   And I, like, man, like, that's it.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.840]   That's it.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.640]   I've always, I think I say it somewhere in the book
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.800]   that, you know, you go to weddings
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.880]   and like when the bride walks in, you know,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.760]   everybody's looking at the bride, it's her show.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.800]   You know, everybody turns around,
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.160]   it's the first glimpse everybody gets of the bride.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   And I never look at the bride.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.840]   I always look at the groom looking at the bride.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.160]   Because there's this, like, to me, that's every,
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.720]   like, he has this look, like,
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.440]   this, 'cause this is the first time he's seeing her
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.680]   in the dress most of the time.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.640]   And also he's seeing her like,
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.000]   "Holy shit, she's coming down the aisle,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.840]   "we're getting married."
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.680]   Like, but this is it.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.160]   And everyone's looking at her.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.640]   And I always look at him, 'cause I always think to myself,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.720]   like, the look on his face is like,
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.600]   that's like this feeling of like, "Holy, yeah, wow, okay."
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   Like, that's, everyone's looking at her and she's mine.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.280]   And she's coming up here and we're getting married.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.280]   And I feel like, yeah, like that kind of adoration.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.240]   Like, I think that's the look we're describing
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.400]   is like adoration, like that the words coming
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.960]   out of their mouth, that they're like,
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.800]   "Yeah, that's mine, that one's mine."
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.120]   You know, that's such a great thing.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.520]   Like, it's such a great feeling.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.360]   - Seeing the good stuff, like with "True Romance,"
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.400]   I mean, you could make fun of the guys,
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.520]   totally cringe wearing Elvis,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.320]   like essentially being a fake Elvis with shades.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.960]   And like, what is he doing?
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.360]   It's like watching these Kung Fu movies.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.320]   But from her perspective and from any perspective
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.440]   you could take on him is this is the baddest motherfucker
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.040]   who's ever lived.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.240]   Like, he's willing to do those things for me,
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.800]   but not like, it's almost like an epic heroic figure.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.680]   And we're living in this epic hero story.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.960]   - And what does that do to him though?
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.120]   That's what, see, that's the point.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.400]   Like, if there was a point to this,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.360]   to this whole thing, this whole couple thing,
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.080]   isn't that it?
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.560]   Like, I don't understand this idea of, you know,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.120]   we had a successful marriage.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.360]   We were married for 50 something years.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.120]   We were miserable for 47 of them, but we hung in there.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.680]   Like, this is an endurance event?
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.880]   Like the primary relationship of your life,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.920]   you've decided you're gonna turn
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.640]   into like a 50 mile trail race.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.480]   Like, why?
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.440]   Why would you do that?
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.880]   Like, congratulations, you took the concept of monogamy
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.680]   and made it something that two people
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.160]   are absolutely not gonna enjoy, but you hung in there.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.280]   Like, congratulations.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.320]   And I understand there's religious perspectives
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.600]   that say, well, it's a sacred covenant,
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.560]   but I have a real chicken or the egg problem with that.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.480]   Because I think it was like, well,
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.040]   how do we sell this incredibly stupid concept
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.640]   that isn't working to people?
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.800]   I know, we'll tell them God says you have to.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.160]   And we'll sign on for that.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.000]   I don't buy it.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.120]   I don't buy it anymore.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   I really, 'cause when you see a successful marriage
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.920]   or you see two, even without a marriage,
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.360]   you see a pair bond, you see a couple
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.880]   that really love each other and cheer for each other
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.600]   in that way and like hang on each other's words that way
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.000]   and like are just in each other's corner that way.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.240]   You see the fake shit instantly.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.920]   Like you see the difference right away.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.520]   It's like, if you, you know, the first time I've,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.720]   this is the first time I've come to Austin.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.680]   I've thought I'd eaten a lot of barbecue in my life.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.160]   I've never had Texas barbecue.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.280]   I landed, I went and had barbecue.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.800]   I was like, okay, I've never had barbecue before.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.960]   Apparently this is a whole different thing.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.000]   I think it's the same thing.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.080]   I think it's like, once you see real love,
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.080]   like real love, and I mean romantic love,
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.880]   like real love like that, real bond, real,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.520]   you go, oh yeah, this other thing's not gonna do it.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.080]   - Do you think that's a daily deliberate choice
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.440]   that a couple like that makes?
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.080]   'Cause it feels like a very easy to do deliberate step.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.400]   Like choose to see the brilliant in it,
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.520]   the beautiful in it.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.880]   And almost immediately everything shifts
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.240]   and it becomes this momentum
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.880]   where all you see is the beautiful
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.440]   and all you see is the brilliant.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.840]   - That is a conscious choice.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.800]   I think approaching life that way is a conscious choice.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.400]   Approaching any relationship that way is a conscious choice.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.160]   I mean, looking at someone who hurts you
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.560]   or does something hurtful to you
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.420]   and thinking about what's going on in their life,
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.200]   that they're doing that or what's happening with them.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.880]   Yeah, that's a very conscious choice.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.400]   And I think a better one,
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.560]   a better one than seething in animosity
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.880]   and letting that eat you alive.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.880]   But I don't know that it's,
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.240]   I don't think it should be so difficult.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.840]   Like with our children, with our pets,
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.680]   we don't have this problem.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.560]   Like you never have someone look at their dog
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.920]   who they've had for eight years and go,
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.160]   I gotta get a new dog.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.220]   Like I've had this one for eight years.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.800]   Like I gotta get, like puppies are so cute.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.480]   What am I doing with this old dog?
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.920]   Like it's the total opposite.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.920]   They're like, oh my God, this is like my dog.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.760]   This is my dog.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.720]   Like the smell of the dog is like, this is my dog's smell.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.680]   The bad habits of the dog.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.760]   You're like, that's my stupid dog that does stupid things.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.280]   And it's not like that has to be a conscious,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.100]   like they wake up every day and go,
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.320]   I should be grateful for the dog.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.800]   Like it's just visceral, it's in them.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.200]   You know, and so, and your children, like people's children.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.560]   You know, it's why people are like not aware
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.800]   of how annoying their children are
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.080]   because they're not annoying to them.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:21.920]   Like I get it.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.520]   Like to you, the sound of your kids shrieking is like,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.360]   oh, my kid's having a good time.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.000]   And you don't get, and see when I hear that,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.480]   I try to hear it with those ears.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.640]   Like, oh, that, like I'm a parent, I get it.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.440]   My kids are adults now, but like, I get it.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.880]   Like, so when I hear a kid shrieking,
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.000]   I just am like, ah, like to that parent,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.060]   that's the sound of that kid having a great time and good.
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.320]   Like, it's so nice that that's in the world.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.560]   But it, so for me, it has to be conscious.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.520]   For that parent, I don't think it has to be conscious.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.920]   So I think it would be great
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.000]   if it didn't have to be a conscious practice.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.120]   But I wonder if like anything in meditation or mindfulness,
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.840]   it's a matter of exercising that way of seeing.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.020]   And then once you've come to that,
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.040]   it does itself, right?
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.400]   Like it really does.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.880]   Like you're, I think it's,
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.440]   it initially has to be a conscious practice.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.440]   And by the way, it's easier to make it a conscious practice
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.680]   before it started to fade, right?
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.360]   Like the, I mean, that's what's so amazing about marriage
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.200]   is there's like almost 8 billion people in the world
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.680]   and you're picking this one.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.520]   So when you marry, in theory,
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.960]   like the stock's at its highest,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.640]   like you're as crazy about each other
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.680]   as you could possibly be.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.320]   So that's the time to get into this mindfulness,
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.040]   to get into this practice.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.280]   Not once it's like the wheels are starting to come off.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.120]   It's much harder.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.440]   It's like gaining a bunch of weight and then saying,
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.520]   okay, how am I gonna lose the weight now?
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.480]   - Well, I think that even before marriage,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.240]   like right away, just see everything is beautiful.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.520]   Let me quote BoJack Horseman on this.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.760]   When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses,
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.440]   all the red flags just look like flags.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.280]   - That's great.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.840]   - There's a certain sense where
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.480]   if you from the very beginning,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.480]   of course you could end up in toxic relationships that way,
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.200]   but life is short.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.160]   You're gonna die eventually.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.440]   Might as well really go all in on relationships.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.760]   - There's a line in "Drugstore Cowboy,"
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.560]   it's a great film, where he says,
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.240]   "We played a game you couldn't win to the utmost."
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.160]   And I think everything,
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.680]   I think life is a game you can't win.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.640]   And so you play it to the utmost.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.480]   Like to love anything is insane
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.720]   because you are accepting that you're going to lose it.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.560]   Like I'm a dog person.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.760]   And you get a dog
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.400]   and you've just resigned yourself to unbelievable pain
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.120]   because this thing's gonna die
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.480]   in like 10 years, maybe 15 if you're lucky.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.080]   And why would you open your heart to that?
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.080]   Why would you let,
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.600]   because the joy is just so wonderful of it,
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.360]   of the ride up until it.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.200]   Same thing with us.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.960]   I mean, every marriage, every relationship,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.080]   every love is gonna end.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.720]   It's gonna end in death or divorce.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.920]   So why not just go in?
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.960]   Like go in.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.880]   Like go in and just get weird.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.720]   Don't define it the way that's,
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.760]   I mean, look at, again,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.000]   we keep going back to "True Romance,"
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.880]   but just get weird.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.120]   Like, yeah, I love this Elvis pretending to be weirdo.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.280]   I love this former sex worker who's like, whatever.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.760]   Like just go in.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.000]   Love this person, have them love you.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.040]   Don't worry about what everybody else is doing
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.160]   in their relationship.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.440]   Like we're in such, I mean, it's not to me surprising
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.400]   that as the performative aspects of life
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.800]   on social media increases,
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.840]   people's satisfaction with their relationships
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.000]   and the divorce rate is following the same trend
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.920]   because I think everyone's going,
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.480]   well, what's everybody else doing?
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.440]   You know, well, how much sex is everyone else having?
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.960]   The only two people that should worry
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.840]   about how much sex you're having are the two people.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.080]   If the two people are happy in the relationship, great.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.920]   Then what does it matter?
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.640]   It doesn't matter what everybody else is doing.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.040]   - Yeah, there should be an element to great relationships
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.160]   and great friendships of like, fuck the world.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.680]   It's us versus the world. - Yeah, it's us.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.880]   It's us.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.040]   And that's what I mean when I say that thick as thieves,
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.560]   like when they're like a unit like that,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.560]   'cause it's, look, it's just us.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.440]   It's just what we want, it's what we like.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.440]   And that's why I said, like, you know,
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.840]   even when it comes to sex or things like that,
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.400]   like if you can't be candid with your partner
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.800]   about whatever weird shit you're into
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.360]   or what fantasy you had in any particular,
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.280]   well, then how can you be candid with?
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.760]   I mean, because you're gonna either go without
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.000]   or go elsewhere, and neither of those
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.440]   is a particularly healthy option or helpful option.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.320]   It's the start of that decline.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.720]   So why, why open yourself to that decline,
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.440]   which invariably is just the path
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.760]   to the chair in front of me in my office?
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.120]   - Yeah, you have a full section in your book
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.000]   on foot fetishes.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.520]   - I do, I do.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.360]   - Yeah, which is funny
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.480]   because I don't know anything about foot fetishes.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.840]   - Me neither. - Yeah, like I can't,
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.200]   I'm not king shaming anybody,
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.120]   but like there's nothing sexual about feet to me at all.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.200]   Like I just don't get it, I don't,
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.960]   but I mean, listen, if people like things, it's good.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   But yeah, I have had clients that have odd fetishes
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.080]   or sexual proclivities or things they wanna do,
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.720]   and they don't share it with their partner at all.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.400]   And then they find an outlet for it
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.640]   because they try to go without it and that doesn't work.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.960]   So they try to find some other outlet for it.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.840]   And then that's interpreted as a betrayal
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.880]   and it creates distance and people split up.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.320]   And of course, everybody likes to have like a,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.120]   you know, a bad guy to blame it on.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.240]   So when you say, well, why'd you guys get divorced?
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.680]   Oh, 'cause he secretly had a foot fetish
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.480]   and he was on these message boards like meeting people.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.480]   But well, it gives you an easy answer
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.960]   as to why the two of you split up.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.800]   But I don't think, you know,
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.000]   most divorces have such simple answers
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.520]   as it was a foot thing.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.760]   But I also think too, like, listen, if you got a partner,
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.840]   I mean, we all do stuff that we're not super into
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.280]   because we're in a relationship.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.560]   And that's what part of it is.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.080]   Like, do you really wanna go see that chick flick?
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.160]   Do you really wanna eat at this restaurant?
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.760]   Do you really wanna go to her cousin's wedding?
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.040]   No, but you know, part of being in a relationship is,
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.080]   okay, if you're into this,
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.000]   I'm gonna pretend this song's a good song, you know,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.920]   even though it's not my favorite song.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.400]   And I think, I just don't know, we've turned sex,
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.240]   I mean, sex has been so politicized in recent years.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.560]   Maybe it always was.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.680]   But I think we've made it into something
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.480]   where we can't just, I don't know, I'm not into feet,
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.160]   but if the woman I love was like, you know,
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.440]   I'm really into feet,
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.400]   like I really wanna do stuff with your feet,
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.720]   I'd be like, all right, I can pretend I'm into that.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.520]   Like, it's not gonna kill me, you know?
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.000]   I'm not gonna be able to make it a centerpiece
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.840]   of our coupling, but you know, like,
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.640]   yeah, I can pretend I'm into feet if you want.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.360]   - I don't personally have any fetishes
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.920]   that are outside of the normal discourse.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.880]   - As a divorce lawyer, I get to experience
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.480]   the whole spectrum.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.560]   - But if I was into like furries, for example,
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.760]   I don't know how I would initiate the conversation
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.160]   with my partner about that.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.840]   - But frame the question the other direction.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.920]   If you were into furries,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.400]   how do you prevent your partner
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.920]   from knowing anything about that?
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.840]   That feels like a real,
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.240]   you'd have to make a conscious choice
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.800]   to not let your partner know that.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   - Sure, sure.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.080]   So I don't think either of those
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.240]   is a particularly palatable or easy proposition.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.120]   - But a lot of people live life
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   hiding some part of themselves.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.440]   - Yeah, quite unsuccessfully.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.960]   Like, the second order effects of that
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.360]   are very rarely positive.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.200]   - Sure.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.160]   - I don't think I've ever met someone who went,
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.400]   yeah, I really hid this huge part of myself
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.240]   for an extended period of time,
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.080]   and that's the best thing that happened.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.320]   I'm really glad I stayed in the closet as long as I did.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.080]   You know, it really worked out.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.240]   Like, it rarely does.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.040]   It's a question of how long can you hold it off?
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.200]   - Yeah.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.120]   - Like, I know gay men who stayed in the closet
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.760]   for 40 years, 50 years of their lives,
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.240]   and then they had a successful second chapter as a gay man.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.640]   I've had clients like that.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.720]   Do they regret that they were in the closet?
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.760]   No, because they were married, they had kids,
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.680]   like, they had experiences they're glad they had.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.720]   But would their advice to a young person
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.440]   in their 20s and 30s who's gay be, stay in the closet,
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.960]   'cause then you can have a wife and some kids,
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.000]   and then you can come out when you're 50 or 60
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.880]   and have a second chapter?
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.720]   No.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.760]   They would say, you know, be who you are,
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.400]   don't be afraid, you know?
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.960]   - As you were talking, I'm trying to think of,
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.320]   'cause I'm publicly and privately,
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.240]   I'm the exact same person,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.960]   or try to be the exact same person.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.560]   So I usually try to make sure there's nothing to hide,
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.320]   but I was trying to come up with a counter example for you
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.160]   for if there's good things to hide.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.600]   Well, I mean, there could be, like, past relationships,
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.880]   like, if I slept with thousands of women
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.320]   or something like this,
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.640]   maybe you wanna put that to the side when you're having a--
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.920]   - Well, you don't wanna be in,
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.360]   there's a difference between being honest about something
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.320]   and being indelicate about it.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.160]   - Right.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.520]   - You know, like, I think we all do this with lovers.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.680]   Like, any of us who've been in more than one relationship,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.280]   you would not, you know, at the end of sex,
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.000]   be like, "That was the third best sex I've ever had."
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.320]   You know, like, that's, it's just indelicate, it's rude.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.960]   You know, so I don't think it's a matter
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.440]   of, like, total candor at all times.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.760]   But I think if you were, we're using the furry example,
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.320]   and I'm not picking on furries.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.920]   I just think if that is a proclivity
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.320]   that is anything other than a passing thought,
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.880]   like, it's something that you just keep coming back to,
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.160]   then you're making a conscious decision
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.560]   to withhold it from your partner.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.920]   And what is that out of?
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.120]   I mean, I would say it's probably out of fear.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.800]   I'm not a psychologist, but probably out of fear.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.960]   Fear that they would reject you, that they,
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.680]   okay, well, now, see, I genuinely believe that this,
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:25.440]   you know, I'm very conflicted in my religious faith,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.520]   but I don't know that I believe in the devil.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.320]   But if there was a devil, I think his principal function
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.920]   would be to convince us that we are so bestial
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.320]   that God couldn't love us.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.120]   It would be to convince us that we're awful,
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.640]   and that we should just lean into the awfulness.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.640]   And I know the greatest low points of my life came
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.040]   whenever I just went, you know what, I'm just awful,
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.440]   I might as well just behave awfully.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.440]   And I really believe that when you don't,
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:09.240]   when you push down parts of yourself, like your sexuality,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.960]   like your insecurities, your true feelings
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.440]   from your romantic partner,
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.800]   the person who's supposed to be your, you know,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.800]   your number one, you are making sure
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.800]   you will never feel their love.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.560]   Because they don't love you,
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.800]   they love the you you've presented to them,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.600]   which you know in your heart
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.560]   is not the authentic, honest, real you.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.960]   And so if you know you're super into furries,
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.520]   and you don't tell your partner about that,
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.320]   and your partner says, I love you so much,
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.160]   and you know what I love?
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.000]   One of the things I love about us
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.800]   is we have such great sexual chemistry,
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   you will never feel that love, because you know,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.720]   yeah, that's not true, though, she doesn't know,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.800]   she doesn't know that actually I'm not really satisfied,
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.160]   and there is this thing that I want
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.000]   that I know I can't even tell her 'cause I'm so ashamed.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.520]   Like that doesn't feel like a good option to me.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.560]   - Yeah, yeah, so that kind of vulnerability
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.400]   is essential to intimacy.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.120]   - You know, I'm prone to jujitsu metaphors,
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.800]   and this is one of the first conversations
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.160]   where I can actually use them,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.200]   because the person I'm talking to is a jujitsu person, but--
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.040]   - And people should know
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   that you are a quote-unquote jujitsu person.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.560]   You have been afflicted with the--
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.760]   - I am a brown belt under Marcella Garcia,
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.000]   and I am like a seven-year brown belt now, so--
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.200]   - Which is the right way to be a brown belt.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.000]   - Well, and also I am, you know, late middle-aged,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.040]   middleweight, and moderately talented,
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.960]   so I'm, and training at that academy
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.920]   with so many incredibly talented people,
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.900]   and training in New York City
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.800]   where there's so many unbelievably talented people,
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.920]   you're constantly humble and feeling like
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.880]   you should just be wearing a blue belt all the time.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.640]   But a lot of, I think, as you know,
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.260]   and as most people who practice jujitsu know,
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.800]   you start to sort of see jujitsu in everything.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   I genuinely believe that in love,
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.880]   you have to give something to get something.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.400]   You have to, everything you do creates a vulnerability.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.240]   You know, every move you make in jujitsu
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.800]   creates opportunity and creates vulnerability.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.440]   And so you have to be willing to create vulnerabilities
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.560]   in order to get any leverage,
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.480]   in order to get any progress,
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.320]   in any way to move the position.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.440]   You know, you don't want a marriage
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.220]   that's just two people both in 50/50.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.880]   You know, like you're just sitting in that car
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.080]   doing nothing, you know?
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.120]   You want it to actually move along.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.240]   - Yeah, I mean, that's the way I see love and relationships,
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.160]   is you should take that leap of vulnerability,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.080]   give the other person the option to destroy you.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.560]   - Well, you have to expose.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   And that's the part that I think is hard for everyone,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.280]   you know, is to expose yourself in that way.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.400]   But that's what I mean even when I said about
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.200]   getting a dog or having a child.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   Like, loving anything is tremendously courageous
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.040]   because it's terrifying.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.680]   And it's only brave if you're scared.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.000]   If you're not scared, you know, it's not brave,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   it's just stupidity.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.920]   It's just, you know, it's bravery
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.320]   when you're afraid and you do the thing anyway.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.640]   And so love is like, yeah, it's scary.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.960]   Like, I don't care who you are.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.000]   Like, you know, being, you know, in the jiu-jitsu community,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.240]   like I'm around, you know, as you are,
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.320]   like incredibly tough people, like physically tough people,
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   mentally tough people.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.880]   But, you know, I've seen some of those people taken down
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.760]   by 120 pound woman, you know?
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.640]   Not from a grappling perspective,
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.440]   but they are taken apart by a woman in their life.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.680]   And vice versa, I've seen men, you know,
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.000]   who like, it really is shocking how much leverage
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.880]   we give to our romantic partners
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.000]   and how little discussion we really,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.920]   genuine discussion we really have about it,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.480]   how much we really are ever trained to think about it.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.360]   You know, there's nothing in school
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.240]   that teaches us about it.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.240]   So much of literature and art is an idealized version of it.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.200]   So little of it is real.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   - And no matter how it evolves,
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.120]   when it ends in tragedy or drama,
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.880]   I feel like what people don't do enough
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.840]   is appreciate the good times.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.040]   Like appreciate how beautiful it is
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.040]   to having taken the risk
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.920]   and to having experienced that kind of love.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.080]   I think when you look at people
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.640]   that are divorcing each other,
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.840]   there's a Edgar Allan Poe quote,
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.520]   "The years of love have been forgot
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.000]   "in the hatred of a minute."
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   I always kind of am saddened, like deeply saddened,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.440]   how people seem to forget
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.440]   how many beautiful moments have been shared
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.760]   when some reason, some drama,
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.360]   some breakup leads them to part ways.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.040]   It's interesting that you came to that
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.520]   not being a divorce lawyer,
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.440]   because I've felt that way for a long time.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.320]   And I really try to say to my clients,
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.280]   like in the courtroom at the negotiating table,
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.960]   I have a role to play
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.680]   where I have to be sort of like a pit bull
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.480]   or some kind of like a courtroom sociopath.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.000]   But behind closed doors,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.560]   like I'm very candid with people.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.080]   I'm trying to be much more emotionally attuned with them.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.320]   - So you're an empath in the sheets
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.920]   and sociopath in the streets?
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.760]   - Exactly correct.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.600]   That's well said.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.560]   I even, boy, I get a new tattoo idea.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.440]   That's good, I like that.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.800]   I, but I do believe when I'm behind closed doors with people,
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.320]   I say to them, how you end things
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.840]   is gonna be how you're gonna remember the whole thing.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.520]   And that's unfortunate,
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.880]   because you watch like a two hour movie,
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.920]   and if the last 15 minutes of it sucked,
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.280]   you go, well, that movie sucked.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.400]   Like, well, the first hour in 45 was great, you know?
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.360]   But you walk out with this bad taste in your mouth.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.880]   I'm genuinely in awe
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:09.280]   of how easily people forget that they loved each other.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.440]   And I'm amazed, because by the time I meet them,
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.600]   and by the time they hire me to be a weapon
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.960]   against the person they were in love with,
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.840]   there's nothing but animosity there.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.320]   And so I have to try to imagine
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.640]   what these two people looked like
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.240]   when they were in love with each other,
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.040]   and how that even existed.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.840]   But I have to tell you, like,
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.640]   you know, I don't function that way.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.640]   Like, every woman I ever had a relationship with,
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.040]   like, when I think of them,
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.720]   I don't think of the ending, necessarily.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.920]   I think of, I try to think about the greatest hits.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.880]   I try to think about the moments that were wonderful,
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.720]   where I loved them and they loved me,
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.520]   and like, there was joy and there was connection.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.880]   And I don't know why you'd choose not to.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.600]   You know, there's that old axiom,
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.480]   I don't know who said it,
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.200]   that if you don't learn to find joy in the snow,
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.880]   you'll have less joy in your life
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.960]   in precisely the same amount of snow.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.800]   And I genuinely believe, like,
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.560]   okay, the relationship ends.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.480]   This is where it ends.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.320]   We're done now.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.640]   I am making a choice as to how I will remember you.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.080]   And we do it in relationships.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.680]   Like, I always tell people, you know,
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.400]   if you ever wanna see a couple light up,
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.080]   if they're ever like the couple at the table
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.480]   that's, you know, it seems like they got in a fight
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.600]   or something, ask them how they met.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.320]   And most people, when they talk about how they met,
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.080]   like, their face softens.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.880]   They both, and the other person looking at them,
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.240]   telling the story, gets that look
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.120]   you were talking about before.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.720]   And 'cause they remember that thing
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.280]   and how they felt at that moment.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.720]   And when this person was a choice, not a default,
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.600]   not their automatic plus one,
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.240]   but the person they asked to the wedding,
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.960]   not the, of course you're bringing her, it's your wife.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.440]   You bring your fucking wife places.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:02.000]   Like it was still, hey, there's like, you know,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.240]   three and a half billion women and I'm picking you.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.040]   You know, like that feeling.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.600]   And I don't know why when a relationship ends,
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.040]   you can't do that.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.760]   A lesson I learned when my mother passed away of a very,
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.280]   she had a two year terrible battle with cancer
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.520]   and was on hospice and was very, very sick.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.080]   And it was a very slow and awful end.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.360]   And I remember one of my worst fears
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.160]   was that this is how I would remember my mother
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.920]   for the rest of my life.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.400]   That I would never be able to think of her,
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.200]   that I didn't think of what she had become
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.240]   in the last months where she was withered away to nothing
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.760]   in this bed, you know.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.040]   And I learned over time that memory is very kind,
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.840]   that like that faded somehow.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.120]   And that now, like when I remember her,
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.040]   I remember her healthy and vibrant.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.160]   I remember her laughter.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.600]   I remember positive things.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.280]   Some of that is I like to look at photos of that.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.400]   But some of it is just how I think memory works.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   And I don't know why we don't apply that to relationships.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.200]   And I think part of it is because we have this binary view
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.680]   of relationships, that it's either success,
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.080]   which means you live happily ever after
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.000]   for the rest of your lives and die together,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.840]   or like in short succession, or it was wrong, it was awful.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.440]   And I don't understand why that would have to be
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.280]   how we do it.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.040]   I think we could look at relationships like what they are,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.800]   which is chapters in a book.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.760]   And that book is our life.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.920]   And those chapters all have significance.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.840]   And none of them would, the later chapters,
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.080]   none of them would happen without the prior ones.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.400]   So there's this beauty in me of that.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.560]   And I don't know if that is a choice
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.600]   or if that is how it is.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.400]   And the rest is just narrative
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.040]   that we've put on top of it culturally for some reason.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.040]   - Well, I think to push back a little bit,
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.480]   I think memory can also, I think it is a deliberate choice
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.840]   'cause I think memory can basically,
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.880]   that's how trauma works.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.640]   It can surface the negative stuff.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.520]   And the negative stuff completely drowns out
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.360]   all the positives.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.600]   So I think it's a deliberate choice
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.080]   to make your memory probably work that way.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.760]   You know, in relationships, betrayal can do that, right?
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.800]   Sort of cheating, infidelity,
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   like one event can almost erase the entirety
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.480]   of your understanding of the past
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.720]   and all the memories are sort of shrouded
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.920]   in this darkness of, okay,
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.480]   what I believed was true is totally untrue.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.960]   And sort of to overcome that
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.120]   and still appreciate the beautiful moments.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.880]   - I'm continually astounded
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   by how long the hurt and anger of betrayal can reverberate.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:08.440]   I have clients who were four years, five years past
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.240]   when the divorce ended, the cheating was discovered
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.000]   and they're as angry as they were the day they found out.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.960]   And I don't know what that's about.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.800]   Because I also have clients that they like look back on it
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.880]   and they go, you know, we screwed up.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.280]   Like we were, you know, we didn't do the best
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.240]   but we did the best we could do at the time.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.560]   And you know, we like,
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.960]   there should be stars for wars like ours, you know?
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.360]   There should be champagne for the survivors.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.000]   Like we made it through, you know?
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.560]   Like we survived it and we were fools
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.800]   and we were fools for love
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.400]   and there are worse things in the world to be fools for.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.720]   But I also do think that most relationships
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.120]   where there was infidelity,
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.200]   and it's not a popular thing to say
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.560]   and I'll get pilloried for it, but.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.400]   - Great.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.680]   - You know, I just don't know
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.640]   and I don't wanna blame the victim of infidelity,
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.200]   but was the relationship really where it needed to be?
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.800]   Like were you truly the most just dutiful spouse
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.680]   who was seeing this person's needs be met?
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.240]   Again, we've established in the granola story
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.960]   that people can sometimes with good intentions
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.680]   not be meeting their partner's needs
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.520]   or perceiving their partner's needs
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.480]   or their partner isn't communicating them the right way
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.480]   or all of the above.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.480]   But I've rarely seen very happy, content couples
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.640]   that cheat on each other.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.640]   And so I understand there's a shame
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.680]   in saying this person cheated on me
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.360]   or I cheated on this person.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:51.240]   'Cause I represent the cheater and I represent the cheated.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.560]   I represent the victim of domestic violence
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.360]   and I represent perpetrator of domestic violence.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.360]   I represent the person with the substance use disorder,
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.600]   the person married to the person.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.200]   So I don't get to choose the white or the black hat.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.360]   Like I have my client and that's my client.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.800]   And it forces me to put myself into their story
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.440]   from their point of view.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.220]   And I think that kind of radical empathy
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.000]   that you need to engage in on a daily basis
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.520]   to represent people in those kinds of proceedings,
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.220]   it just, I don't know, it just doesn't seem
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.480]   like there's good guys and bad guys.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.120]   It just seems like it's complicated
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.560]   and people's intentions
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.800]   and where they actually end up are different.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.680]   - Yeah, I think there's some sense in still remembering
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.840]   the betrayal as it being a symptom
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.960]   of taking life a little too seriously.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.460]   Too seriously where you don't,
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.280]   life shouldn't be taken that seriously.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.760]   You should be able to laugh at it all.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.080]   Like the story you say,
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.280]   be able to appreciate the battle
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.440]   that should give stars for those kind of wars
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.440]   that we fought and just kind of be able to laugh at it all.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.480]   - Especially with love.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.600]   Like love's just so absurd.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.760]   Like it's so-- - It's just crazy.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.840]   - It's so crazy.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.760]   I mean, like I don't, you know, I think it's funny.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.120]   I think, I mean, this is real candor,
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.840]   but you know, as a man, like there's nothing funnier
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.840]   than when you finish masturbating, you know?
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.640]   There's no more humbling moment.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.840]   And I like to think about the fact
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.520]   that like the richest, famous,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.800]   most powerful person in the world, they jerk off.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.880]   You know, the most powerful man in the world jerks off.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.480]   I'm sure, you know, all of them do.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.640]   I mean, you probably know them, so you could ask, but.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.520]   And that moment where you just, you come and you go,
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.360]   what am I doing?
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.480]   Like what the, now I gotta wipe that, like, oh, good Lord.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.800]   And there's this feeling of, but a second ago,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.160]   this seemed like a great idea.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.040]   And it was, by the way, it was a great idea.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   But there's this moment, this satori, you know,
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.760]   where you just go, oh, like, what, this is so silly.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.720]   Well, like, that's love, that's sex.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.040]   Like, it's crazy.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.400]   When you read other people's infidelity,
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.440]   the text messages, the emails,
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.080]   'cause I have to do that all the time.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.960]   And I'll tell you how we make the sausage.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.520]   In a divorce lawyer's office,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.040]   the some of the most entertaining moments
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.440]   is dramatic readings aloud of people's infidelity exchanges
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   with their lovers.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.280]   The sexts.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.800]   Yeah, the sexts and the like, you know,
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.600]   like, it's just so ridiculous.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.240]   'Cause people have to go through like all kinds of gymnastics
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:27.880]   to be able to meet and have sex in weird places.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.200]   And, you know, and you're reading this
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.720]   and you're reading these texts and you kind of go like,
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.960]   oh my God, these people.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.520]   And by the way, like, I've represented
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.680]   some very powerful people.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.600]   And you read their texts with their lover
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.240]   or even their spouse, like even their spouse, you know,
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.560]   and they're just pathetic.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.040]   I mean, they're just like so not powerful.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.400]   They're so like, hey, babe, you know.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.600]   I have a, I have a, I'll remain totally nameless.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.600]   I have a very powerful, wealthy, famous former client
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.840]   where there's a whole series of texts about,
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.960]   is my dick weird?
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.240]   Which by the way, I think the answer is,
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.800]   is if you have to ask if you have a weird dick,
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.920]   the answer is probably yes.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.840]   'Cause I've owned one and I've never thought,
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.680]   is this weird?
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:18.280]   But I, the fact that you're having this discussion,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.800]   like it's absurd, it's hilarious.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.840]   Like love is hilarious, it's bizarre.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.480]   It's such a weird vulnerability.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.240]   It's such a basic visceral human need.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:31.160]   You know, it really is something that we just,
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.640]   you know, it's mysterious.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.160]   But it doesn't have to be that complicated.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.840]   I don't think that even betrayal, like I said,
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.040]   it doesn't have to be that complicated.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.160]   I think we can frame it differently.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.280]   - Yeah, you can laugh at the whole thing.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.320]   I mean, I think what we don't often do with ourselves
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.240]   is look back at texts or look back at emails
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.800]   or look back at Google search.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.040]   I did that recently.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:59.160]   Just looking at what I searched for like 10 years ago, 15.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.040]   It's like, forget last week.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.040]   Just look at your Google searches last week.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.280]   And you're like, wait a minute, what?
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.520]   Why did you just search for this 50 times?
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.480]   - Right, why did the Karate Kid 3 pop in my head?
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.320]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.760]   Why, and like you're like--
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.280]   - Where's Ralph Macchio now?
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.600]   - And who is he dating?
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.120]   - Why is, and then mother, and then you're like--
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.560]   - And then a restaurant nearby.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.760]   Like how did I go from this to that?
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.440]   But it made sense at the time.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.840]   - So when you ask someone,
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.120]   how did our relationship fall apart?
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.360]   It's like looking at the Google search history
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.680]   of yourself from 10 years.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.560]   You don't even know why you were thinking
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.280]   about those things.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.520]   And now you wanna understand why you did what you did,
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   felt what you felt, she felt what she felt,
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.920]   she did what she did, and why the two of you,
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.600]   how you impacted each other and interacted with each other.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.560]   Really?
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.640]   You think that's doable?
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.280]   - So you've, in the courtroom,
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.480]   does that come up, like text messages
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:08.520]   that resulted in whoever you're cheating with?
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.600]   - Yeah, I mean, you know,
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.800]   cheating doesn't come up as much
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.720]   because most states are no-fault states now.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.280]   So why someone's getting divorced,
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.840]   whether it's infidelity or, you know, it doesn't matter.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.240]   There's no good spouse bonus or bad spouse penalty.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.080]   - Oh, there isn't.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.720]   I mean, can you elaborate on that?
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.400]   - Well, you can have, we've had times
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.440]   where we have to prove infidelity
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.040]   because we wanna prove what's called
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.840]   wasteful dissipation of marital assets,
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.920]   which means that you were spending money
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.400]   that was marital money on a paramour.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   That's what the legal name for a ex, you know,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.600]   for a boyfriend or girlfriend in the marriage.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.280]   And usually the person calls it, you know,
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.640]   that whore or that piece of shit,
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.320]   but we call the paramour, yeah, the paramour.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.160]   And the, you know, sometimes we have to prove
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.560]   inclination and opportunity.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.800]   We have to prove that this person
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.320]   had the inclination to cheat
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.960]   and that they had the opportunity to cheat.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.240]   And then we wanna show that, okay,
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.520]   so when they went away,
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.560]   that should be considered dissipation of marital assets.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.920]   So if you go out to dinner with your brother,
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.880]   you didn't dissipate the marital estate.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.240]   But if you bought your paramour a Tiffany bracelet,
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.880]   that would be a dissipation of marital assets
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.000]   and the person's entitled to a credit back for that
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.720]   from what was taken out of the marital estate.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.320]   So we do sometimes have to authenticate text messages
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.640]   on the witness stand or in depositions, you know.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.560]   And what's interesting about that
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.000]   is the way people approach it.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.960]   People sometimes try to pretend,
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.440]   "Oh no, this is just my good friend," you know,
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.120]   which is just like you kill your credibility.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.960]   You know, if you, "Oh no, she's just my very good friend."
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.280]   She's not, she's not.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.360]   That makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.840]   Or, "No, we were just friends at that point."
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.120]   And then several months later is when we,
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.560]   once this marriage was over,
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.520]   that's when we got together as partner.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.160]   That's ridiculous.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.120]   But sometimes people just own it, just own it.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.280]   Like I did a deposition of an executive once
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.200]   and opposing counsel thought they were gonna really hit 'em.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.520]   They were like, "And looking at this credit card receipt,
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.400]   "what was this charge for, for this hotel?"
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.960]   He's like, "Oh, that was for a hotel room
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.640]   "that I got with my girlfriend."
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.480]   "And you were married?"
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.320]   "Yes, yes."
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.720]   "Where did you stay at the hotel?"
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.720]   It was, we didn't even stay.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.320]   We actually just did like an afternoon delight,
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.960]   rolled around in bed for the day.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.080]   - Yeah.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.480]   - And it was like, well now, you know,
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.000]   took all the thunder out of that.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.240]   - What's the downside of doing that?
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.080]   That seems like a really--
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.920]   - There wasn't.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.000]   - That actually I think helped his credibility.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.920]   It was my client, so I thought it was the right move.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.480]   We hadn't really discussed it in advance,
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.840]   but he was naturally intelligent enough to go,
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.360]   "Yeah, my credibility, like I'm not gonna lie under oath.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.720]   "I'll admit what it was, but I'll do it in such an,"
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.920]   you know, we did it like at the end,
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.960]   like Eminem at the end of "Eight Mile."
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.320]   Like it was very like,
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.520]   "Yeah, I cheated on her with this person.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.560]   "Now tell these people something
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.800]   "they don't know about me."
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.640]   You know?
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.840]   And that's kind of how I try to,
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.160]   as a trial lawyer, we actually in my firm
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.800]   refer to it as the "Eight Mile" strategy,
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.720]   which is like, we will,
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.160]   if I know there was a text message sent,
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.240]   you know, "You piece of shit, I hope you die."
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.000]   My client sent that text message to his co-parent.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.480]   On my examination of my client,
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.840]   I will say, "I'd like to have this marked
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.880]   "for identification, shown to the witness."
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.720]   What is that?
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.000]   It's a text message.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.240]   Who's it to?
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.880]   A plaintiff.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.800]   You sent it?
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.600]   Read it out loud for the court.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.040]   Do I have to?
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.040]   I think you should.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.640]   You're a piece of S.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.680]   Does it say S?
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.240]   No.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.080]   What does it say?
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:35.960]   Well, it's a profanity.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:36.960]   So you say it's a,
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.640]   "You piece of shit, I hope that she die."
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.720]   You sent that to her?
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.560]   Yes.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.400]   Why?
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.680]   I was really mad.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.720]   Do you think that was good?
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.560]   No.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.400]   Do you think it was helpful
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.480]   for your co-parenting relationship with her?
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.320]   No.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.080]   Why did you send it then?
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.240]   You know, she sent me like 50 texts exactly like that,
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   and I never responded, and I pushed it down every time,
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.200]   and then finally, I just blew up at her.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.120]   If you had it to do over again,
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.520]   would you do it differently?
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.240]   You know, I wish I could say I would,
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.440]   but the truth is, I'm human, and I was at my limits,
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.360]   and I'm watching opposing counsel
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.400]   cross out entire sheets of their cross-examination,
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.560]   'cause it's gone now.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:20.360]   They thought that they had their like Perry Mason moment.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.760]   They had their like, "Did you order the code red?" moment,
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.000]   and it's gone now.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.520]   Because if you just own and accept your fault
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.840]   or your issues in the relationship,
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.440]   you can take a lot of the power out of that.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.480]   And I wish we wouldn't take texts seriously.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.320]   I don't think we should have
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.240]   substantive discussions via text.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.000]   I think text was designed for, "Are you here?
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.640]   "Yes, 15 minutes away."
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.200]   Or, "I got here safely, love you."
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.520]   Like that substantive discussions.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.960]   People love having arguments via text.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.800]   And I have to say,
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.640]   when you read other people's text messages,
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.720]   as I am often forced to do, it is amazing,
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.480]   because just like that Google history
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.680]   you were talking about,
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.640]   I don't know how the hell you got
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.040]   from one thing to another.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.520]   Like I was just reading, actually on the way here,
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.600]   in the car, I was reading through a text exchange
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.280]   between two co-parents in the middle of a custody thing
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.400]   that I'm involved in.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.160]   And it's like, "You piece of shit.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.560]   "You never cared about anything,
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.400]   "and I'm gonna take,
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.920]   "you have no right to take the kids from me."
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:27.760]   Da, da, da, da.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.320]   And then the next day, nothing in between.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.480]   The next day,
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.920]   Maddie got a good grade on her science thing.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.760]   "Oh, that's great.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.640]   "She's doing so well, it makes me so happy.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.780]   "Yeah, her teacher said she's doing really well.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.240]   "Yeah, that's really great to see.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.840]   "I'll be there about 15 minutes late.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.240]   "No problem, see you then."
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.960]   Wait, like it was a day ago.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.360]   I wanna know, was there a phone conversation in between
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:54.520]   where one of you went, "Hey man, listen,
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.440]   "I'm really sorry about that.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.520]   "Oh no, look, we were both pissed, whatever."
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.120]   Or is it just like you did that,
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.680]   and then we're supposed to pretend that didn't happen,
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.680]   and now we're just gonna talk about
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.100]   what Maddie got on her test?
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.560]   - Yeah, well, sometimes a good nap
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:05.520]   or a good night's sleep
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.120]   can solve a lot of emotional issues.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.960]   - I totally get it, but is there some,
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.720]   if you're looking just at the texts,
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.680]   like it begs the question,
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.200]   wouldn't you take the nap and then go,
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.720]   "Hey, listen, I just woke up from the nap.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.960]   "It turns out I was really tired."
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.880]   Like, does that not happen by text?
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.700]   - Oh no, that's, 'cause sometimes it's hard
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.240]   to probably apologize for being an asshole, right?
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.960]   So I think we use just text.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.600]   We humans use all kinds of forms of communication
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.880]   to kind of vent.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.720]   I think it's the wrong thing to do,
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.720]   but people do do that.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.000]   - Text has a permanence, though.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.200]   It's writing.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.040]   I mean, it's writing.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.440]   - You think like a lawyer.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.960]   I like it. - You think like a lawyer,
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.480]   but lawyers think like detail, you know?
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.000]   And why would you write that down?
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.840]   Like, you know, writing it down?
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.040]   Like, would you write it down
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.620]   and would you put it on a billboard in Times Square?
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:00.800]   'Cause like, everything you say on Facebook or Instagram
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.640]   can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.280]   Like, every photo you post,
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:09.480]   I mean, that's going on with, what's his name?
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.520]   Jake Paul or whatever Paul and Dylan Danis right now.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.080]   That guy's girlfriend,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.040]   every picture that's ever been put on the internet
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.640]   of her, by her, is being weaponized right now.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.560]   - To reference an earlier part of our discussion,
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.560]   that's love, you take a big risk,
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.300]   big risk putting it out there.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.400]   Putting it out there on text,
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.480]   putting it out there on social media.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   - But is the reward of doing it via text worthwhile?
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.920]   Listen, the reward of love, I think,
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.600]   is worth the risks of love.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.760]   But the benefit of communicating by text,
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.760]   does it merit that risk of that being in writing
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.120]   that the person can reflect on and review
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.240]   and scroll back and get heated up again about?
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.640]   - I don't know, we just take risks
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.400]   and we're vulnerable with each other.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.240]   - There may be something about text
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:07.700]   that for whatever reasons inspires a kind of candor.
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:13.220]   Because I think it is a new way to communicate, right?
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.580]   In the scheme of things.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.700]   And so sometimes, we don't know the thing
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.820]   until it's really come into existence.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:23.620]   So I don't know, I think it started as something
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:24.860]   that we just communicated
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.940]   in a very extemporaneous unplanned way.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:30.900]   Like texts were meant to be, I'm here, I'm outside,
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:31.940]   whatever it might be.
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:37.340]   And so what happens when you start to talk
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:40.140]   about more emotional, deeper, bigger things
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.140]   or visceral things or more emphatic, passionate things
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.740]   using a technology that was originally
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.380]   just being used for the other purpose?
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:49.580]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.860]   What I do know is, yeah, as a lawyer,
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:56.180]   A, from an evidentiary perspective,
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:57:00.740]   and B, I just know what it looks like on the outside.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:05.740]   Like I know when I read it, what it looks like.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.100]   And that's not always accurate.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:11.140]   Like to just see the, it's like when you watch a video
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:14.020]   of someone at just their worst moment, you know?
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.780]   And the person tries to say, but wait, that's not me.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.500]   Like that was just me in that moment.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.620]   That was me at this incredible low point.
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:25.620]   And I think as a lawyer, my job is to weaponize that
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.140]   and to try to say, okay, this low point
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.300]   is indicative of who they actually are.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.140]   - Yeah.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.020]   - And when I'm defending someone, I'm supposed to say,
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.380]   you know, well, this is their low point
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.620]   and we've all been to a low point
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.260]   and this is just a moment in this person
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.860]   and to judge them by that moment,
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.900]   would you wanna be judged by your worst moment?
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:44.660]   So I have to be able to look at that both directions.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:47.020]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't think anyone looks great on text.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.860]   - I mean, there's so much of our communication
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:52.380]   that is missing, you know, your expression.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:55.260]   Like my sense of humor does not do well via text.
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.020]   Like I, 'cause I have like sometimes
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:01.940]   a sarcastic sense of humor or I have a dry sense of humor
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.700]   and it does not always translate well to text.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.260]   The nuance of things is lost sometimes, you know.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:12.340]   - Yeah, but that's what makes the risk of it hilarious.
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.420]   I mean, the emojis, the memes, all that,
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.140]   taking a risk, the dry, there's a risk with a text
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:23.140]   if you do some like dark, dry statement, right?
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.260]   That's a joke and then the pause
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.980]   and then there's no response for a couple hours.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:30.140]   I mean, that's beautifying, you know.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.100]   - It's like a, it's the, you know,
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.940]   it's the gap between the two trapezes, you know.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:37.940]   Like once you've hit send and you're like,
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:39.780]   well, let's see where this goes.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.460]   Like, this is coming back now, you know.
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:43.900]   And you're waiting and waiting.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:47.380]   It's like that moment of just hang is, yeah, that's a rush.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.220]   I mean, that's a rush, that's a beautiful thing.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:52.260]   - Well, I have my friend, Michael Malice living close by
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:56.100]   and if the courtroom were ever to see the text between us,
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:01.100]   we would be both in jail for many, many years.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.660]   - Subpoena, yeah, when this finally comes out,
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.500]   when I have my Johnny Depp, Amber Heard moment.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.460]   - The subpoena's ready.
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.820]   - We'll get Michael Malice.
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:09.860]   - Well, but that was one of, you know,
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:13.340]   the Johnny Depp, Amber Heard thing was a great example of,
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.740]   in a gunfight between those two,
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.260]   everyone was cheering for the bullets.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.820]   I mean, no one was,
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:20.220]   I don't think anybody looked like a hero.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.020]   They both looked like what they are, which is humans,
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:26.820]   really flawed humans who had, you know,
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.980]   it really is like that People magazine thing,
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.780]   stars, they're just like us, you know?
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.580]   Like we watched that and went like,
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:33.740]   oh yeah, they're just like us.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.820]   Like they cannot keep it together.
[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.900]   They cannot have, like they just have
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.820]   these ridiculous toxic moments
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:42.700]   where both of them look awful in that trial.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.460]   - What do you take away from that trial,
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:47.260]   just given all the work you've done?
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.940]   I mean, for me, I don't know if you can speak to that.
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.020]   It's probably the first time I've seen
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:56.980]   that kind of a complicated relationship,
[00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:02.900]   even just to say a relationship laid out in this raw form,
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.660]   like the fights of a relationship.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:10.540]   - My feeling about that trial is there is no amount of money
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.340]   that would be worth laying that kind of stuff bare publicly.
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.180]   - For you, if you were Johnny Depp.
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.020]   - For me, yeah.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.900]   There's no amount of money.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.540]   - Because they both look awful.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.420]   - They both look awful.
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.140]   And I don't think I'm qualified to say
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.660]   if one or both of them are awful,
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.900]   but they both had moments in that courtroom
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.740]   where their behavior and words looked awful.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:37.740]   And I just don't know that exposing that to the world,
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.460]   I just don't know.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.220]   I mean, I understand the point of view
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.860]   that by bringing that suit, Johnny Depp was saying,
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.700]   look, yeah, I have to show these awful things
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.300]   to the world about myself,
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.620]   but it's not as bad as what she's claimed I've done.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.460]   So I get it.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.300]   I'm not saying that's incorrect.
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.020]   And for Amber Heard, I think her response is,
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.580]   well, for him to say I'm lying, I have to prove my,
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.780]   but my God, like what an awful thing to watch.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:09.500]   All it really is is just another couple.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.940]   You know how banal that is?
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:12.780]   You don't met many of those.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.340]   - This kind of stuff happens a lot.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.580]   - A lot?
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.420]   It's the norm.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.460]   It's not the exception.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.580]   They just happen to have like a grand scale
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.380]   'cause they have lots of people around them
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.620]   and lots of money.
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.020]   But yeah, it's all this, that kind of dysfunction,
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.780]   that kind of chaos, that kind of he said, she said,
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:33.020]   two people with completely differing histories
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.460]   of what happened in the marriage,
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.580]   false allegations of domestic violence
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.420]   or true allegations of domestic violence
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.260]   that are completely denied by the person.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.340]   And you have witnesses that'll say,
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.300]   oh my God, they never engaged in any kind.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.180]   'Cause again, no one engages in domestic violence
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.860]   with company over.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.220]   You don't like invite friends.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.780]   Like people always say, oh no, I saw them.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.780]   They seemed so happy.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.140]   Like people always do this to me as a divorce lawyer.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.940]   They come in and they go, well, here's photos of the kids
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.380]   smiling with me.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.300]   So that's proof that like I'm a good dad.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.180]   And I'm like, there's photos of Jeffrey Dahmer
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.620]   smiling with people he ate later.
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:08.220]   And you think these photos prove something?
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.500]   Like I don't, the lack of,
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.460]   I'm in the middle of a very complex domestic violence trial.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.060]   And the entire defense on the other side is,
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:18.180]   well, we have photos of them on vacation
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:21.660]   where they look very happy and she never called the cops.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.300]   That's no defense at all.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.340]   Like most victims of intimate partner abuse
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.940]   don't call the cops.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.580]   They don't identify,
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.780]   self-identify as victims of domestic violence.
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.620]   - And they probably have many stretches of time
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.860]   of intense happiness or happiness.
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:37.700]   - Of course.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.220]   And by the way, perpetrators of domestic violence
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.660]   are charismatic.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.500]   How else would they get victims?
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.060]   It's not like if they were ogre-ish,
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.060]   no one would sign on for that relationship.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.740]   It's that when they're good, they're so good
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.380]   that when they're bad, you go, but wait, no, that's not him.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:57.340]   The really good person's him or her.
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:01.340]   We saw that in the public testimony of that Dep Heard thing
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.580]   is there were moments where you look at her and go,
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.940]   oh my God, like I want one just like that.
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:08.620]   And there are moments where you listen to the testimony
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.940]   and go, oh my God, she's awful.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.340]   Like what, that's just evil.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.580]   And the same for him.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.580]   So I really, this should teach us something about
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:23.740]   how not only are there two sides to every story,
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.660]   like that there's just so much complexity and nuance
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.500]   to these relationships.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.940]   But I think everyone was asking the question,
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.300]   whether you were team Dep, team Heard or team,
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.660]   I could care less about either of these people.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.060]   Everybody's looking at it going, why?
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.460]   Like why, 8 billion people in the world.
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:41.740]   Why did you stay together?
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.940]   Just break up, you're miserable.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.180]   It's obvious, it's obvious you're not,
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.180]   this can't be worth it.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.940]   - I've actually become friendly with Camille Vasquez,
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.740]   who's the lawyer on the Dep side.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.140]   She's an incredible woman.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:53.980]   - Great lawyer.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.900]   - And just a great human being.
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.460]   Just how passionate she's about her work.
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:00.020]   I mean, you radiate this kind of same passion.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.860]   Like she's just truly happy doing what she does.
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:07.860]   And, but also where the stress of a case is like,
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.940]   takes, like it is, becomes her.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.020]   She's, you can't sleep, all this kind of stuff.
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.460]   Which is fascinating.
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.420]   - I think that's a function of our professions.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:21.500]   We, even after 20 plus years of doing this,
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.540]   like the night before a trial, I can hardly sleep.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.380]   And I--
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.220]   - Excitement, fear?
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.820]   - Yes, yes.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.820]   All of that, all of that.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:34.420]   And I even have moments as I pull up to the courthouse
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.580]   and I listen, I wear certain cuff links
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.060]   that are like my lucky cuff links or something.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.860]   And I pull up to the courthouse,
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.940]   I walk into the courtroom and I have this feeling
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.540]   in the pit of my stomach.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.180]   And then it starts.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.340]   And the moment it starts, something in me goes,
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.340]   oh yeah, I know how to do this.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:56.580]   And it's instantly, like I just, I own it, I love it.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.460]   And it's, yeah, it's the people that love this job,
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.020]   being a trial lawyer,
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.380]   being a particularly a divorce trial lawyer,
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.300]   family law trial lawyer.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.420]   It's, I love it.
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:10.060]   I love, I love it more than I loved it
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:10.940]   when I started doing it.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.940]   I still, I can't imagine spending five days a week
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:16.100]   looking forward to two.
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.580]   I love what I do.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.700]   I don't know that I'll ever love anyone
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.220]   or anything more than I love the work.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:28.780]   - So I saw you on the talk with Steve Harvey
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:30.980]   a bunch of times and I always loved it.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:34.560]   One thing just sticks in my head from something he said
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   as advice that if you and your partner, your spouse,
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.780]   are, if there's a fight, there's a difficult thing
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.820]   you have to deal with, keep that to yourself.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.140]   Don't talk to anyone else.
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.380]   Like that's a little, like what does he say?
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.300]   Like a two-armed circle or something,
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.460]   whatever the expression is.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:55.220]   But basically resolve it all internally.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.540]   Don't, like when you face the world,
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.220]   you have a front of like,
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:02.780]   don't take sides against the family.
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.620]   - Yeah.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:07.140]   Yes, like it all boils down to Godfather.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.940]   - Everything boils down to Godfather references.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.780]   It really does.
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:11.420]   - Yeah, you don't take sides against the family.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:16.420]   You don't show that weakness to the world.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:21.420]   I mean, again, I don't know that Steve in candor
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.820]   would say you shouldn't discuss it
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.740]   with your own therapist, you know?
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.700]   But I think what he's saying is don't project it out
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.760]   to the world, don't share that,
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.580]   because I think it can change the way people
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.860]   view your relationship, which then will change
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.940]   the way you view your relationship, you know?
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:42.180]   And so I think don't run reckless
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:46.540]   when it comes to that primary relationship.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.260]   Don't run your mouth recklessly.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.260]   - Yeah, it's one of the things I mentioned to you offline
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.260]   that my now close friend Joe Rogan,
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.660]   I've never heard him ever speak negatively of his wife.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.380]   It's always like super positive,
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.020]   how awesome of a person she is.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.780]   And that to me has always been an inspiration
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:06.380]   to do the same for everybody in my life,
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.020]   to always speak positively about them.
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:13.620]   That has probably a virtuous spiral effect.
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.460]   - I'm sure.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:19.100]   That's probably because he has a great wife,
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.300]   and he has a great wife in part because of that.
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:26.580]   Like I think it's clear that he's in her corner
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.460]   and cheering for her, it's clear she's cheering for him.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:33.540]   It's not like Joe Rogan's not a man who has opportunity.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.980]   I mean, he's surrounded by UFC ring girls, for God's sakes.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.020]   Like this is a guy who has all the opportunity in the world,
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.420]   and he seems to be quite a fan of his wife.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:44.180]   And that's a superpower, like that's a real thing.
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:48.540]   Now the question is, he doesn't seem to talk about it,
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.380]   like, "Oh, I gotta really work at that."
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:52.700]   And that's not a man who's afraid
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.740]   to talk about what he works at.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.340]   He's pretty honest about, "Man, yeah,
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.300]   "I gotta work really hard to stay in show.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.780]   "I gotta work really hard to be able to do this.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.540]   "Like, yeah, I'm not good at memorizing that,
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.740]   "it takes time."
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.220]   But I've never heard him say like,
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.140]   "Oh, marriage is a lot of work."
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.380]   And I think that's to his credit,
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.700]   because it seems like they're enjoying that.
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:14.780]   And it's also not incredibly public.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:15.700]   Like it's not something,
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.540]   most people couldn't pick her out of a lineup.
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.300]   - He kept it private for many years,
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.820]   and just because it's a private joy,
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:25.140]   it's a private, deep, meaningful, intimate partnership.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.700]   That's interesting, that's also an inspiration.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.620]   Not everything about your life has to be this,
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:32.940]   like, "Look at me, I'm happy.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.420]   "I'm in a happy relationship, everything is wonderful."
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.660]   Especially that, I think there is something about
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:44.660]   the womb-like, cocoon-like joy, you know, of love.
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:50.500]   You know, when you're just tucked in, snuggled in,
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.140]   like just pressed against each other with that.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.420]   Like that's such a, you know, like a,
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.620]   it's just the two of you.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:58.780]   - Yeah. - And that's lovely.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:01.020]   You know, and that's such a good thing.
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:04.060]   Like we were just dying for connection, you know?
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:08.740]   And that connection is so big, it's so everything.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.620]   You know, one of my earliest psychedelic experiences,
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.820]   probably when I was a teenager,
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.540]   but a theme that's been persistent
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:19.420]   in every psychedelic experience I've ever had,
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:22.780]   is this idea of like everything is connection.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:27.780]   Everything is being pressed to someone and with them,
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.460]   you know, like the warmth of human connection.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:35.180]   Like one of the reasons I enjoy listening to your work
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.860]   and your perspective has always been
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.860]   that I think at the core, you see connection and love.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:46.940]   And I think for me, from my earliest experiences
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.580]   with psychedelics at, you know, 16, 17,
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.700]   I was very attuned to that.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:58.580]   I was very much, that was put on my radar by psychedelics.
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.820]   And just stayed part of my consciousness forever.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.900]   And I think I had a 30 something year break from psychedelics
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.420]   but it was like, when I came back to it,
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.820]   I went, oh yeah, it's still there.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:12.500]   That's still the core of everything, is connection.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.340]   - I mean, it's fascinating how deeply you value connection,
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.340]   how empathic you are,
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.940]   that you would be doing what you're doing,
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.020]   which is, or is it not?
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.580]   It's not counterintuitive. - I think it's the opposite.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:28.420]   No, I think it's actually why I'm well-suited for what I do.
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:33.420]   I think what I do is I have to learn the story of my client
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:37.140]   and know it and feel it very deeply.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:40.660]   And I have to feel it in a very human way
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:43.540]   that's very compassionate to this person.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.540]   And then I have to feel it and understand it in a way
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.740]   that's incredibly antagonistic to it
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:51.100]   so I can shore up defenses.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:56.100]   So I have to feel this person's story and feelings
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.180]   from every possible angle
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.260]   because every one of them is a vulnerability
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:03.140]   and every one of them is a potential strength
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.420]   and a potential defense.
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:08.660]   And so I actually think it's my number one,
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.580]   other than extemporaneous speaking ability,
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:15.020]   it is my number one job tool,
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:19.420]   is the ability to radically empathize
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.220]   and to put myself in the emotional state of someone
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:26.140]   in its best possible light and its worst possible light
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.300]   so that I can see, again, the defense
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.020]   and I can see the vulnerability.
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.780]   - But I mean, so that's beautifully put,
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:37.180]   but also just to bear witness to this connection
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:40.220]   broken in the most dramatic way
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.740]   over and over and over and over.
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.100]   - That part is hard,
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:46.860]   but I was a hospice volunteer for many, many years
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.620]   when I first got out of college.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:53.900]   And it really showed me a lot about,
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.020]   what is sadness?
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.540]   What is tragic?
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.140]   And what is just inevitable decay?
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.900]   What is pain and decay?
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.740]   Like we all die.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.220]   Like we play a game you can't win to the utmost.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:13.300]   And so if we know the answer to all of this
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.580]   is you're going to die,
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.180]   then what do we do with the rest of that time?
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:19.260]   If all your stuff is just stuff,
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.100]   it's just gonna go to the,
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.380]   you know, the money's gonna go,
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.060]   like everything's, your looks is gonna go,
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.180]   your everything's gonna go,
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.020]   love's gonna end one way or the other,
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.340]   then what are we doing?
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.100]   You know, and again, I think it's love and connection,
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:34.620]   but what I'm doing for a living is helping,
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.940]   and I don't look at it as what I'm doing
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.420]   is helping people beat the crap out of each other.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:42.540]   I look at it as I'm trying to help a client
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:46.100]   build their post-divorce life
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.420]   to sort of rise from the ashes
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.180]   of that which has fallen apart
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.620]   and move on to the next chapter
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.420]   and refocus and have the things they need,
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.060]   financially, emotionally, whatever it might be,
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.060]   interpersonally, in terms of with their kids.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.060]   And so for me, it's actually a job
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:03.100]   that is very consistent with my desire
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.940]   to build connection and to be empathetic.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.260]   - And witnessing the ashes doesn't make you cynical
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.300]   about the whole thing of love.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.820]   - No, because again, you know,
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:15.100]   56% of marriages end in divorce,
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:18.420]   but 84% are remarried within five years.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.540]   Like we keep doing it over and over again.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.380]   - And that's a good thing.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.980]   - I think it is a good thing.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:26.180]   - The mess of it, the absurdity of it,
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:31.020]   the hypocrisy of it, that's something beautiful about that.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.020]   - Well, it's just the return is so great on the investment.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:37.460]   Like, listen, man, I've had more than one dog.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:42.060]   Like when my dog died, the first dog I had died,
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.340]   I remember when I'm never gonna love again.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.380]   I'm done, I'm done with this.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:50.180]   I will never expose myself to this kind of pain again.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.900]   I'll never have to take the dog bed
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:56.180]   and put it in the closet and like, ugh.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:01.380]   And then some friend called me and said,
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.620]   "We have an adoption event.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.940]   Can you just watch this dog for 24 hours
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.500]   and then we'll take him, you know, we just need to,"
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.100]   you know, and I went, "Yeah, all right,
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.140]   I'll watch a dog for the night," you know,
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.380]   and this dog come in and he said, "Oh, he has mange.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.660]   He's not gonna, fuck, I got another dog."
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.660]   He walked in, my heart went, "Yeah, I got a dog."
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:22.660]   And now that dog is 13 years old and his eyes are cloudy
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:25.900]   and he doesn't go up the stairs real well
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.540]   and he's gonna break my heart.
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:32.140]   And I wouldn't change that for the world.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:33.760]   I'm still there.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.340]   I'm still struggling for the second one.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.860]   I've lost a dog and it broke my heart.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.900]   But-
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:44.740]   And you'll never, you'll never lose that pain.
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:49.740]   But I promise you, your heart has an infinite capacity
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:53.080]   for the kind of love you felt with that dog.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.580]   And you'll never feel a love that replaces the whole,
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.820]   like there will never be another buster for me.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:04.080]   But there was Cabba.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.860]   And like, you know what?
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.260]   Like, and when he's gone,
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.820]   there will never be another one of him.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.660]   But you know what?
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:17.460]   When that stupid puppy that was five months old
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:22.020]   stumbled in, I went, "I guess I'm gonna do this again."
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:22.860]   And you know what?
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:23.680]   I'm so glad.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.520]   I'm so glad.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.820]   And I know, by the way, I know now,
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.380]   because and that's where I've said,
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.420]   like, you know, it's that Joseph Brodsky poem,
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.420]   you know, a song.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:33.420]   Like, "I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear."
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.500]   Like, "I wish I didn't know the pain."
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.320]   But you know what?
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.540]   Like, I don't care.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.360]   I don't care.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.700]   And I believe we don't care.
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:42.860]   And I think there's something to that.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:46.020]   If something hurts so badly,
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.660]   and you go, "I'm gonna do it again.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:48.500]   "I'm gonna do it again."
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:49.980]   Then it must be of value.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.540]   It must be of real value.
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:55.340]   - There's also a different perspective on it, that pain.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:57.700]   So there's that from Louis,
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.820]   the show of this interaction with an old man,
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:00.660]   with Louis C.K.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:01.960]   And he says that,
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.980]   'cause Louis is mourning the loss of,
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.900]   got split up, he got dumped or whatever.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.900]   He's mourning the loss of that partner of love.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.900]   And the old man says that that is the best part.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:19.500]   Like, missing the love is still love.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.860]   The real bad part is when you forget it,
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:26.580]   when the pain fades, and it's all gone.
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.180]   But the pain is actually a kind of celebration
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:30.020]   of the love you had.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:30.840]   - Of course.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.420]   - Well, the opposite of love isn't hate.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.860]   The opposite of love is indifference.
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:36.700]   There's no question about that.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.860]   I mean, hate is a passionate emotion.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:40.340]   Love is a passionate emotion.
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:42.700]   But, and there is a school of thought that says
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.780]   that only unfulfilled love can be truly romantic.
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.500]   But I believe that,
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.260]   it's what I think I learned from hospice,
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:56.060]   is that I think, for me,
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:00.940]   knowing the impermanence is the thing.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.100]   You know, it's the key.
[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.180]   - Yeah, it's finite.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:04.700]   Eventually it's gonna be over.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.260]   And so, like, that intensifies the feeling,
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:10.980]   that that's when you can have pure love without the drama.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:14.500]   - Dogs are, for me, a great example.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.620]   And again, I don't know what it all means, right,
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:20.420]   existentially, but I just feel like they have,
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:25.340]   that kind of love has to be here to teach us something.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.340]   And I feel like the fact that they're so amazing
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:30.380]   and just so loving and so wonderful,
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.940]   and the bond we feel is so amazing and deep
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:36.500]   and doesn't require a lot of maintenance.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.740]   And yet it's so finite.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.900]   Like, it's just this short little lifespan.
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:44.780]   And I feel like there's just such a lesson there.
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.500]   You know, there's so much there to unpack
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   about the nature of connection and loss.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:57.740]   And, you know, that your heart has this infinite capacity.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.460]   Like when you're, I'm telling you,
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.220]   when my dog died, when Buster died,
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:05.340]   I remember I'm thinking with certainty,
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.340]   I will never do this again
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.620]   because I'll never love that way again.
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:13.540]   I'll never love a dog the way I love this dog.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.780]   And it's just not true.
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:16.220]   That's just not true.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.660]   Like you have this infinite capacity.
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.580]   And that makes it scary, actually,
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.780]   because like right now,
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:27.460]   there's so many people you could love.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:29.060]   There's so many dogs you could love.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.420]   Like there's so much out there.
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:34.380]   And it requires a certain bravery
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:37.540]   and tremendous amount of risk to do it, you know?
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.980]   - And a commitment.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:42.660]   'Cause I think to really experience love,
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.620]   you should just dive in.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.660]   'Cause there is a huge number of people,
[01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:50.620]   but to really like, I mean, you have to like
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:56.380]   really dive into the full complexity,
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.540]   the full range of another human being.
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:00.380]   - Yeah, which is hard.
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:02.260]   Because we don't even, I don't know that we even
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:05.340]   feel comfortable diving into the full range of ourselves.
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.500]   You know, there's pieces of ourselves
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.780]   we try to push away or not think about.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:13.580]   - Okay, so speaking of the whole sociopath slash empath
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.620]   that is all embodied in one human being, that is you,
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:19.220]   let's go back to some cases, perhaps,
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.260]   that you've worked on,
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:23.180]   just something that stands out to you.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:26.420]   What's maybe the craziest,
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.140]   most complicated thing you've worked on?
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:29.540]   Is there something that pops to mind?
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:31.460]   - Craziest would be different than most complicated.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.300]   - Let's go craziest.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.900]   - Yeah, so craziest.
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.860]   Gosh, that's a great question.
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:40.900]   So from a chaos standpoint, I mean,
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.140]   I see so many bizarre fact patterns
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:46.020]   and so many variations of people cheating with people,
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.500]   people sleeping with the nanny,
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.260]   people sleeping with someone's, a relative of their spouse,
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.340]   people having same sex or polyamorous relationships
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:55.540]   and the other person doesn't even know
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.100]   they're not monogamous.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:01.380]   So much craziness that you could fill 15 books.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.420]   In terms of complexity, I mean,
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:08.060]   emotionally complex is any custody case
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.820]   is emotionally complex
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.660]   because you're dealing with parenting issues
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.860]   and what makes a good parent, I think,
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:16.900]   is a very tricky question because,
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:22.180]   I'm trying to convince a judge who's a better parent
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:28.220]   and that is so loaded with subjective value judgments.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:34.180]   - Is there, just to linger on the maternal presumption,
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:38.500]   is that a thing you come face to face with often?
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.580]   - Well, there was, I mean, it was real.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:41.620]   It was the law.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:42.700]   There was something in the law
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.180]   called the maternal presumption.
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:46.380]   It was also known as the tender years doctrine,
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.540]   which meant that a child under the age of seven
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.380]   was presumed to be in the custody of the mother
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:54.820]   unless you could show she was an unfit mother.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.860]   So that's where the idea of like,
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.620]   someone has to be proven an unfit mother came from.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:04.620]   Now in the '80s, 1980s, that was changed.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:09.940]   But, under my skin is under my sovereignty.
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:14.940]   I mean, you can't suggest that there isn't in the world
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:19.980]   a suggestion that a mother who births a child
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.620]   and feeds a child with her body
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:26.300]   doesn't have a particular bond with a child
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:29.980]   that's different than a father's bond with a child.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:32.780]   So where do we put that?
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.980]   How much importance do we put on it?
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:38.340]   Now that there's better and more research
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.580]   in the mental health field
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:42.580]   about attachment theory and infants,
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:47.580]   there's also a lot of research on how is attachment formed?
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.500]   How should parenting schedules be put together
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.460]   based on attachment theory?
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:58.020]   But, there's conflicting perspectives on that.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.340]   - And so as judge to judge,
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:01.300]   you see like, is there a lot of variation?
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:03.820]   - Yeah, there is because there's lots of kinds of judges.
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.140]   Like there's judges that are thoughtful, enlightened,
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.300]   interested in the mental health research.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.620]   And there's judges that just want,
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:13.740]   were unsuccessful lawyers that were good politically
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:16.380]   and got elected and they just wanna,
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.860]   they just want a job where like they show up at nine o'clock
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:21.660]   they have a lunch break from 12 until two o'clock
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.820]   and that they leave at 4.30
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.300]   and they get a certain number of weeks vacation
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.140]   and a pension after 20 years.
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:31.060]   - So what is in general the process of these custody battles?
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:34.780]   Like what's the landscape?
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:39.660]   - Well, most the overwhelming majority of custody cases
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.980]   don't end up in my office.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:46.980]   They are a negotiation between two people
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.300]   that love their children more than they dislike
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:51.500]   their soon to be ex.
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.620]   So the overwhelming majority of cases
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:57.700]   are just two people going, okay,
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.300]   how are we gonna make decisions together?
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.700]   'Cause there are decisions that have to be made about kids.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.220]   Will they go to public or private school?
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.700]   Can they go on medication if they need it or not?
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.220]   Should we change pediatricians?
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:09.780]   You know, all those kinds of things.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.100]   How do we make decisions?
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.860]   And when will we each spend time with the kids?
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.340]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.580]   Most custody cases are just a discussion,
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:22.860]   a negotiation between counsel about those issues.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:26.220]   And they're not ugly and they're not anything.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.380]   They're just people.
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:29.780]   Again, sometimes people have differing perspectives,
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.580]   you know, but sometimes people haven't thought
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:32.700]   through their perspective.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.660]   So as a divorce lawyer,
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.860]   a lot of what I'm doing is counseling a person
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:39.300]   because they come in and say,
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.700]   well, I've been the person who handles, you know,
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.020]   all of the homework and all of the everything.
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.500]   So he should only see the kids on weekends.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.220]   And there's a logic to that.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.900]   Like I've always done the homework with the kids.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.460]   So I'm the parent who's in charge of the homework.
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.380]   And he's obviously not done that before.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:59.100]   But there's also a logic that you can then say, right,
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.700]   but then you're doing all the heavy lifting of parenting
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:02.940]   and he's doing none of that.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.340]   And you were a married couple and living together.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.020]   So he was trusting you to do that
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:09.740]   because you're good at it and you seem to like it.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:12.100]   So maybe now we want him to have to do
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.980]   some of the heavy lifting of parenting
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:17.420]   because we don't want the child when they're 13 to say,
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.700]   I love dad.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.180]   We have nothing but a good time together.
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.420]   Whereas you make me do my homework and eat my broccoli.
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.100]   Dad's the grass on the other side of the fence
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.140]   that's greener.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.820]   So sometimes it's about educating a client
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.620]   to like change their frame, you know,
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:30.260]   to look at this differently.
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:32.860]   Yeah, okay, we always go to my mother's for Thanksgiving.
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.540]   So I need every Thanksgiving.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.060]   Okay, well, you were married.
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.980]   So you went to, now you're gonna have new traditions.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.460]   Things are changing for your children.
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:40.580]   Things are changing for your family.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:42.140]   You're both gonna have new traditions.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.460]   So a lot of times it's just educating people
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:49.220]   on looking at things in a different way,
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:51.540]   looking at their parenting in a different way.
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.260]   We're not gonna live in the same house anymore,
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.380]   but we're still gonna parent these child,
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.380]   you know, this child or these children together.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:00.620]   What's much more interesting,
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:01.740]   'cause like, you know,
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.020]   I don't get invited to a lot of parties,
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.300]   but when I get invited to parties,
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:07.140]   if somebody says, what do you do for a living?
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.740]   And I say, I'm a divorce lawyer.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.380]   And they go, oh my God, you must have stories.
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.220]   That's the way everybody's,
[01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:13.860]   oh my God, you must have so many stories.
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.860]   And if I said, yeah, there was this couple
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.020]   and they, you know, slowly grew apart
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.460]   and then they decided that it would be good
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:22.400]   for them to end their relationship as a married couple,
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.340]   but they wanted to continue
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:25.700]   to have an amicable co-parenting relationship.
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.100]   So they divided their assets
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:29.620]   and they figured out a good parenting access schedule
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:32.380]   that made sure that they both had both leisure time
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.260]   and responsibilities with the children.
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:36.020]   People would be like, that's the worst fucking story.
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:37.260]   Yeah, that's so boring.
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:38.100]   - Yeah.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.380]   - So what they really want is the like,
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.100]   and then he was sleeping with the nanny
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.300]   and then she caught him.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.980]   So, you know, the truth is like,
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:48.660]   people want to hear about those flame outs.
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:51.580]   And by the way, those are super interesting as a lawyer.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.980]   Like, it's super interesting.
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.020]   - It's usually gonna be what, infidelity?
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.780]   You do have a chapter called, Everybody Fucks the Nanny.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.180]   - Everybody's Fucking the Nanny.
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:03.300]   Yeah, there's a nanny fascination out there.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.420]   I try to explain it in the book, but yeah.
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.020]   I mean, I've had some great nanny stories.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:09.660]   I mean, people run off with the nanny,
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:12.540]   people end up getting married to the nanny.
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:15.820]   I had one where he convinced her
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.500]   that they should have a threesome with the nanny.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.700]   They got the nanny drunk.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.540]   They had a bunch of threesomes with the nanny
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:24.460]   and then the nanny and the wife paired up and left him.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.300]   - Oh, nice.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:26.540]   - And they're still quite happy.
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.420]   - That seems like a happy ending to the whole thing.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.860]   - For everyone but him, but it was his idea.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:33.620]   - Well, he's really gonna have a nanny fascination now.
[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.340]   - Now he's, yeah, well, now he's gotta see the nanny
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.220]   who's now the like step-parents to the kids.
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.860]   And it was his bright idea
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:44.180]   of let's have a threesome with the nanny.
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:48.180]   Yeah, I mean, the nanny thing, I think is a function of,
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:52.940]   in many circumstances, is the characteristics of the wife
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:56.620]   that he remembers fondly
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:01.860]   and that have been extinguished by the presence of children.
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:07.180]   So my words of wisdom is not don't get a nanny
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.340]   or make sure you get an ugly nanny.
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:13.940]   My thought on it is that a woman should remember,
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:18.860]   even when she's a mother, that she's also a woman who a man,
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:20.620]   they fell in love with each other
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:22.820]   and she should take time to be in touch
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:26.500]   with the part of herself that is an independent woman
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.900]   that's interesting and interested.
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:32.460]   And there's a lot to be learned from divorced couples
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:36.380]   because divorced couples, if you do it right, it's awesome.
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:41.180]   I had a wonderful experience parenting and being divorced
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:43.780]   'cause I divorced when my kids were quite young.
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.860]   My co-parent, my ex-wife is awesome.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:49.860]   She's a great mom, nice person, we're good friends.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.380]   And it was great.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:54.620]   I had half the time I had my kids and I could focus on them.
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:55.860]   And the other half of the time,
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:58.020]   they were with the other person who loves them
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.420]   as much as I do.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:01.740]   And I didn't have any of the responsibilities of kids.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.980]   And I could just have all of the wonderful fun
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:09.460]   that you can have when you don't have the responsibilities
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.960]   that come with full-time caring for children.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.660]   - What would you say now on the flip positive side,
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:19.020]   we've been talking about the collapse of things.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.380]   What about success?
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:23.940]   What's the secret to a successful romantic relationship?
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:28.240]   - My mom used to say that it's hard to define intelligence,
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.140]   but you could spot stupid a mile away.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:37.140]   So I'm much better at pointing out where people fall apart
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:40.420]   'cause I spend a lot of time with people
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.780]   who have fallen apart in their relationship.
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:48.780]   So it's easy to then say, well, just don't do what they do.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:53.400]   But I don't know that that's not an oversimplification.
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:29:00.180]   So again, I think the answer is connection.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:05.820]   I think the answer is affection, presence,
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:11.300]   mindfulness and presence.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:16.300]   I do think in my personal and professional experience
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:24.100]   that most people want you fully,
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:28.540]   more than they just want you in a disconnected way.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:33.100]   So if you were to say to your romantic partner,
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:35.940]   you can have me for two hours
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:38.500]   where I'm giving you my undivided attention
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:43.700]   and I'm really joyful to be with you.
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:45.380]   Or you can have me for eight hours
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.300]   where I'm sort of half paying attention
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:50.100]   and I kind of wanna be someplace else for part of the time.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:52.820]   There's just no choice there, it's so obvious.
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:56.820]   So I think presence is a big piece.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:01.820]   And I think that the you, the me and the we
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:09.260]   I think is important because I think in relationships
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.100]   there's you and there's me and we meet
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:18.260]   and something magical happens and we become we.
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:23.020]   And now there's you and there's me and there's we.
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:26.300]   And then the we gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:27.260]   And isn't it great?
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.700]   'Cause it's such a nice warm place.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:34.660]   It gets so big, but it gets so big that you get small
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:37.620]   and me gets small 'cause we.
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.060]   And if any of us dares to ask,
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:40.940]   well, what about you?
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:41.780]   What about me?
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.220]   No, no, no, the we, what, you don't like the we?
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.340]   You don't wanna be with the we?
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:46.660]   Like, well, no, it's not that.
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:49.500]   But the we only exists 'cause there was you
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.740]   and there was me and I really liked you
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:53.420]   and you really liked me.
[01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:57.260]   And so we picked each other out of lots of choices.
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:00.660]   And now this we is so fucking big.
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:03.860]   Like it threatens to just consume all of it.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:08.860]   And I really think that there's something there
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:11.300]   we have to look at more honestly.
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.340]   - So the we should not consume everything,
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:17.940]   but at the same time, not be small.
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:20.340]   - Well, the we is the you and the me.
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:24.820]   And if you mix it so much that you and me loses
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:31.220]   its components that all that's left is we,
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.260]   like, I don't think that that's the way to do it.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.460]   I just think there's a,
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:38.260]   the world pulls us in that direction.
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.740]   Like we get told culturally that,
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.940]   well, why aren't you going with this person to that?
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:45.060]   Why would you do that by yourself?
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.660]   And why?
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.060]   Like anyone knows that there's joy
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.780]   in being away from each other
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:52.580]   and there's joy being reunited together.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:57.580]   So why don't we speak very honestly about that?
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:01.260]   And I think some of that's our own insecurity.
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.780]   Well, why don't you wanna be with me 24 hours a day?
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:04.740]   Aren't I wonderful?
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:05.740]   Aren't I delightful?
[01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:06.860]   It's like, wait, what?
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:12.020]   - Well, but also probably people are either afraid
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:15.340]   or lazy in developing their individual selves.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:17.020]   I mean, it's still,
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:19.740]   it's lonely going out there in the world by yourself
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:22.180]   and it's comforting in that little cocoon of we.
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.540]   - I mean, it can also be incredibly adventurous
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:26.140]   going out into the world by yourself
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.740]   and then coming back to the we with a full report.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:29.580]   - Yeah.
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.540]   - Coming back and saying like, oh my God, guess what I saw?
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.380]   Guess what I did?
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.140]   Oh my God, we have to go there together now.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:36.460]   'Cause all I could think about was you.
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:37.540]   While I was there, I was like, oh my God,
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:39.340]   she would love this.
[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:41.060]   That's magical.
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:42.220]   That's amazing.
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:44.980]   Like, look what I brought you back.
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.740]   I went into this and then I got you this present from there.
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:50.700]   Like there's something, and we know this.
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:52.740]   I always thought it was,
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:54.740]   like when you watch the old Westerns,
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.660]   or like the hero's leaving
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:00.780]   and he's walking away from the cabin
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:02.260]   'cause he's gonna go fight the gunfight
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.580]   and she runs up and she goes,
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:06.660]   "Please don't go, don't go, stay here with me."
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.340]   And he like kisses her and then he goes.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.020]   If he goes like, yeah, you're right, I'll just stay here.
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:11.860]   It's cool.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:13.980]   Like this is, I didn't wanna deal with that anyway.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:15.660]   Like he's not the hero anymore then.
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:16.500]   - Yeah.
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:17.340]   (laughs)
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:18.980]   Yeah, there's deep truth to that.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:23.420]   And then probably, like you mentioned, sex.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.340]   - Sexes.
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:25.420]   - Probably a big part of it.
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:26.940]   Friendship.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.820]   That seems to me like a really important one.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:30.300]   - Depends on how you define friend.
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:33.420]   Like, you know, if being a friend
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.740]   means we have some connection to each other
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.580]   and we have each other's cell phone numbers,
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.180]   okay, then we're friends.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.980]   But if it's a bigger definition than that,
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:43.260]   if it's like you've picked me up at the airport,
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:46.380]   you know, or like, you know, you're someone I could call.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.260]   Then it's like, dude, I gotta hide a body.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:49.980]   Like you get shovel and lime.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:54.340]   - I like how you escalated from airport pickup to murder.
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:55.620]   - Yeah, I tried to go the two directions.
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:57.900]   Well, I have to tell you, I define, you know,
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:00.700]   the Ben Affleck movie, "The Town," you know,
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:03.420]   that scene, that's friendship to me.
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:06.820]   I mean, to me, the ideal male friendship is the scene
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.380]   where he says, "I need you to come with me.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.460]   "We're gonna hurt some people
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.620]   "and you never have to ask me about it again."
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:15.140]   And he says, "Whose car are we taking?"
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:17.540]   And that's sort of like, to me, that's friendship.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:20.700]   So it's a high bar, you know, to be like a friend.
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.820]   So when you say like friendship,
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:25.500]   I think that's the kind of friendship
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.580]   you should ideally have with your romantic partner.
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:28.780]   If you're getting married,
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:30.780]   it should be the like, whose car are we taking?
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:33.780]   Like it should be that it's you and me.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:36.500]   - To be fair, that bar's reached with me
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.500]   with a lot of people.
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.780]   Like if you called me tomorrow, there's a body.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:43.100]   - But you're a big open heart.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:43.940]   - But it's true.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:48.660]   Like I wonder how many people out there are like that
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:50.580]   in terms of hiding the body.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:52.300]   - I mean, my theory on this,
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:56.860]   'cause I think I'm like you in that way.
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:00.860]   I think I'm very sensitive.
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:05.500]   I feel things really deeply, you know?
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:09.780]   And I think it's, that's a,
[01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:12.740]   the world is terrifying when you feel things very deeply
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:15.500]   because there's so much pain, there's so much betrayal,
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:18.620]   there's so many opportunities to be hurt, you know?
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:23.260]   And I think when you are that kind of person,
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:26.300]   you go through like stages.
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.260]   And one of them is that I don't care, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:29.380]   It doesn't matter, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.740]   I don't feel anything, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.620]   Well, you try to convince yourself, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:34.540]   It's fine, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.180]   And then at some point, like, you know,
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:37.860]   you do feel all of it.
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:39.700]   And then it's like, oh my God, the weight of this is crap.
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:42.300]   I mean, I think it's the whole arc of Pink Floyd, The Wall.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.820]   It's literally the entire arc of Pink Floyd, The Wall,
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.780]   you know, and the song "Stop," you know,
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.580]   where I wanna go home, take off this uniform
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:51.420]   and leave the show.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.460]   Like you just, when you feel all of it,
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:56.340]   the army of hammers coming at you,
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:58.300]   the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.660]   you know, the thousand natural shocks,
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:01.420]   the flesh is here too.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:05.900]   When you feel all of that deeply, you know,
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:10.500]   it's very hard, but it can also be a superpower.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:14.420]   Because I think when you can bring that to a relationship,
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:16.700]   when you can bring that to a profession,
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:18.300]   like you've done and I've done,
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.940]   then there's something very magical about that.
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:25.620]   The ability to bring it out in someone,
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:28.780]   to feel it in yourself, to understand it, you know,
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:30.860]   is a gift, it's a wonderful, wonderful gift.
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:35.780]   I'm humbled by what it brought me professionally.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.180]   And I'd like to think that you and I
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:41.540]   have both found professions that enable us
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:44.580]   to use that sensitivity, that empathy
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:46.860]   in a productive and good way,
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:49.620]   and in a fulfilling, a personally fulfilling way.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:52.820]   And ideally in a way that does good for other people.
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:59.060]   - You yourself are incredibly successful and high performer.
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.540]   You've dealt with a lot of CEOs
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:04.260]   and just high performers in all walks of life.
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:09.260]   What can you say about successful relationships
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.020]   with those kinds of folks?
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.460]   - That's a good question.
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:14.580]   I think--
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:15.540]   - Is it all the same stuff,
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:19.100]   or there's something special when they're busier?
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:23.820]   - Well, you know, I think when you represent
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:27.180]   high net worth individuals, but also high performing,
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.740]   I would make a distinction between high net worth
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:29.580]   and high performing.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:32.260]   So I've done high net worth divorces
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:34.580]   where the person's like a trust fund kid,
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.860]   even though they're an adult,
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:38.300]   but they're like, what they did to achieve
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:41.860]   their high net worth status is their great grandfather died.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:45.620]   So that is different than someone who is self-made,
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:49.700]   who through discipline, focus, entrepreneurship,
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:54.700]   whatever it might be, that they have found success.
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:57.820]   And there's also a difference between financial success
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:02.700]   and fame, 'cause I've represented famous people
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:05.100]   that actually did not have that much money
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.140]   in the scheme of things or much liquidity.
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:11.660]   And I've represented people that were not in any way famous
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:13.820]   and were very high performing in their field.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:16.580]   Like in New York, we have a lot of finance people.
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:21.580]   And what I find is their divorces are challenging,
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:26.540]   one on a technical level, because figuring out
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:29.060]   what they have and how to divide it is tricky.
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:29.900]   Sure, yeah.
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.980]   Because when something's moving that quickly,
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:36.980]   like when your portfolio's movement affects a market,
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:39.220]   that's challenging.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:43.220]   Jeff Bezos' divorce for a time,
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:47.740]   when it was in its early stages, could affect Amazon stock.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:51.820]   It did, so that's a real thing.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:56.020]   There are businesses that are affected by a divorce.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:39:01.020]   But in terms of being in a relationship with someone
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:05.820]   who is a high performing person,
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:09.780]   most of the high performing people I know
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:13.660]   are creatures of discipline and routine.
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:19.260]   From Joe Rogan, we've talked about any of these people,
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:21.060]   like they have a routine, they have a discipline,
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:24.260]   they have a focus, they have a way they like to do things,
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:26.900]   they have a type of coffee they like to drink,
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:28.780]   they have a way that they like to do.
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:31.780]   And divorce is a tremendous disruption.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.420]   I mean, divorce is fundamental things in your life
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:37.060]   are shifted out of your control.
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:39.940]   Like your spouse may be the one who has decided
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.540]   you are no longer going to live in that house.
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:44.980]   You will no longer see your children on these days.
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:47.380]   So to take that control away from someone
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:49.100]   is very, very hard.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.940]   I mean, when someone is a high performing,
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:56.380]   high net worth person, they are used to being told yes.
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:58.340]   They are used to being able to buy their way
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.020]   out of a problem.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:05.020]   But just like illness, you can hire the best doctor,
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:10.700]   but you can't cure cancer because you have a lot of money.
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.860]   Like you can hire the best lawyer,
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:15.900]   but you can't cure a custody case.
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:19.420]   And that's, I mean, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:22.100]   seemingly endless custody disputes
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.060]   that have been going on for years now
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:28.340]   with the best lawyers in California working on them
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:31.380]   is proof of the fact that you can't just buy a resolution
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:34.180]   to those things, that you have to go through it
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.680]   just like everyone else.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.180]   - So that lets me ask the question
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:41.760]   of how much does a divorce usually cost?
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.940]   - It's a great question.
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:47.320]   Average divorce, I mean, it's sort of like a,
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.520]   what I always tell clients in the first consultation
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.400]   is I tell them that the most reasonable question
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.640]   a person could ask me sitting in that chair across from me
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.080]   is two, how long is this gonna take?
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.480]   And how much is it gonna cost?
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.520]   And those are the two questions I can't answer.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.480]   And then the next thing they say is, give me a range,
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:09.920]   which is a bit like calling your doctor and saying,
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.400]   I have a headache, what is it?
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.740]   Well, I can't tell you, I'd have to do tests.
[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.340]   Give me a range.
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:20.180]   Okay.
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:24.320]   It's a reaction to the barometric pressure
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.340]   and it'll be gone in 15 minutes.
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:29.500]   Or it's a brain aneurysm and you'll be dead in five minutes.
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.520]   There's your range.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.140]   And so it didn't really help, right?
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:39.140]   So I have the least expensive divorce I've ever seen
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:47.060]   is two people who, one of whom comes into my office
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:50.460]   and says, we've written down on a yellow pad
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:52.060]   what we figured out at the kitchen table.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:55.220]   She's gonna keep the house, I'm gonna keep the 401k.
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.940]   We have a bank account at this bank,
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.620]   we're gonna split that 50/50.
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.140]   I'm gonna pay her this much in child support each month
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:03.020]   and we're gonna agree from time to time
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.700]   on what we're gonna do in terms of the schedule
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:06.840]   with the kids, but they're primarily gonna live with her.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:09.620]   Can you write this up and make it legally binding?
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:11.640]   Yes, 3,500 bucks.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:14.420]   Just as a side note, I have a friend
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:19.420]   who went through a divorce and handled it just masterfully
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:23.580]   by giving more than he's supposed to
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:26.500]   and having nothing but love in his heart
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:28.700]   and happiness with the kids and just,
[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:34.620]   I don't know, that to me is just an inspiration.
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:38.820]   His whole view was like, who cares about money?
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.660]   - Well, yeah.
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:44.660]   - Also, he refused with every ounce of his being
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:49.240]   to have anything but complete love for the other person.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.000]   - Yeah, I've had clients who, with a straight face,
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.440]   will say to me, "Well, I'm not gonna quibble
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:56.500]   "over a few million dollars," and they mean it
[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.640]   because to them, it's numbers on a page.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.520]   So I'll personalize this a bit.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.520]   So I have a friendly relationship with my ex-wife
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:07.000]   who's the mother of my sons who are adults
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.440]   and we have maintained a very good relationship.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:13.680]   And so now it's many years divorced later,
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:16.880]   17, 18 years later, and we were able
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.760]   to sort of post-game that relationship,
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.520]   even our co-parenting relationship.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.860]   We kind of post-game it when we chat with each other.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.560]   And I remember once saying to her,
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:31.640]   "You never screwed around with me when it came to the kids.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:33.580]   "You were always so cool.
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.820]   "If I called you, if I was having a really bad day at work
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.680]   "or seeing just an ugly custody case,
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:43.980]   "and I just felt like I would call her and say,
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.380]   "Hey, can I just pick the boys up
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:47.060]   "and take them out for ice cream or something tonight?
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.600]   "I know it's not my night, but would you mind
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.220]   "if I just took them out for a couple hours?"
[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:51.660]   She'd be like, "Yeah, sure, come on by."
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:54.060]   She was always flexible like that.
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.180]   And I said to her, "Was that just goodwill,
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.040]   "like you're just a good person?
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.580]   "Or what was that about?"
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:00.840]   And she was like, "Yeah, it was partly that,
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:03.140]   "but it was partly that you never screwed around with me
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:04.780]   "when it came to money.
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:05.780]   "If the kids needed something,
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:08.220]   "or if I needed something as the mother of the kids,
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:10.340]   "you were always like, 'Yeah, sure, of course.'"
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:12.100]   Her air conditioning kicked out,
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:13.180]   and she needed to replace it,
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.980]   and she didn't have liquidity at the time.
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:16.220]   And I didn't have a lot of money at the time
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:17.340]   'cause it was a long time ago.
[01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:18.220]   And I was like, "All right, no, no, no,
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:19.780]   "'cause I don't want you hot and upset,
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.300]   "and I don't want the boys to be in, of course."
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:28.180]   And so I think, yeah, when you approach a conflict with,
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:29.580]   it's very hard to argue with someone
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.900]   who won't argue with you.
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:34.940]   If the person approaches the argument
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:37.980]   from the point of view of, "I'm not gonna argue with you.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:40.080]   "I'm gonna absorb your aggression.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:43.100]   "I'm gonna just not meet it with that.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.340]   "I'm gonna meet it with love.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:46.020]   "I'm gonna meet it with positivity."
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:48.280]   It doesn't always work, 'cause sometimes people are so angry
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.780]   that they just are, they're relentless.
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:54.300]   But I have to tell you, the louder you get,
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:58.380]   the quieter I get, the more you seem irrational.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:02.300]   And that's what I always try to bring
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.940]   that to court proceedings.
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:05.060]   I always try to bring to court,
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:08.620]   like if I know my adversary's coming in hard,
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:12.920]   I'll come in quiet, slow, and deliberate,
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.740]   because I want the volume to be turned up
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:18.140]   way too high over there.
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:20.540]   And then it looks like, "What's the,
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:23.460]   "your honor, what's their problem over there?"
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:26.940]   And I think that, I say this to clients.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:27.860]   They got a four-year-old,
[01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:29.940]   they're getting divorced, let's say.
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:34.940]   There's gonna be a wedding in like 20-something years.
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:37.180]   There's gonna be a wedding.
[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:39.680]   And it's either gonna be the wedding
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.580]   where they gotta put these people
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.220]   on opposite sides of the room,
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:43.900]   'cause if they pass each other by the shrimp boat,
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:45.100]   they're gonna kill each other,
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:46.980]   or it's the wedding where you stand there,
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:48.720]   you take some pictures, you kinda go like,
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:50.980]   "Yeah, we fucked up this whole marriage thing,
[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:53.860]   "but man, we did a good job with this kid, did we?"
[01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:56.940]   And the decisions you make right now,
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:59.700]   there's a straight line to that wedding.
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.340]   And so even if you don't like this person,
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.280]   even if you're mad at them,
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.180]   even if you're mad at yourself for the choices you made
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:05.660]   in choosing them as a co-parent,
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:10.660]   like every single Mother's Day for 27 years,
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:14.320]   I have told my now long-time ex-wife,
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.640]   "Happy Mother's Day.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.020]   "I'm so glad that we had kids together.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:20.620]   "I'm so glad you're the mother of my kids,
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:21.660]   "'cause they wouldn't be who they are
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.580]   "if it wasn't that they were part me and part you,
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.540]   "and I'm so grateful for you,
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:29.020]   "and I'm always cheering for you."
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   Like, how hard is that?
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.220]   How hard is that?
[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:33.900]   - Well, it's really hard for some people, but it's--
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:35.940]   - I don't understand why it's so hard for some people.
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:37.940]   I'll tell you, I do find that hard.
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:41.420]   There's not a lot of things that I kinda don't understand,
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:43.300]   but that's one that I kinda don't understand.
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:44.560]   Like, I put in,
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:50.300]   one of the weird things I did as a divorce lawyer
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:55.040]   that caused a little stir among my colleagues
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.660]   for a few years was some years ago,
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:01.780]   like, we all steal from each other's work, divorce lawyers.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.780]   Like, we're like the matrimonial mafia.
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:04.780]   Like, we all know each other,
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:07.860]   we all deal with each other over and over again,
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:10.140]   but we all have the same job,
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:11.460]   and so we're the only people
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:13.700]   that really know the unique stresses of that job.
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:15.100]   So even though we try to kill each other all day,
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:16.820]   it's like boxers, like professional fighters.
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:19.100]   Like, yeah, your job's to take each other's head off,
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:21.380]   but like, nobody knows what the two of you went through
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:22.660]   like the two of you.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:24.060]   You know, that's why, like, I always get,
[01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:25.900]   like, I go like all kinds of rubbery
[01:47:25.900 --> 01:47:27.020]   when I see after the fight,
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:28.660]   like the two people hug each other.
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:30.780]   'Cause I'm always like, like, yeah, 'cause you know what?
[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:33.220]   They relate to each other better than anybody.
[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:35.040]   They suffered, they bled.
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.400]   You know, the competitors, they bled, you know?
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.020]   So I really think divorce lawyers,
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.500]   we have that same kind of relationship.
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.560]   Like, we went through this stress, you know,
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:46.000]   on opposite sides, trying to take each other apart.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.900]   And I find that, you know,
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:55.220]   we all steal from each other's material
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:56.780]   when it comes to separation agreements,
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:58.780]   provisions that we use for agreements.
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:47:59.700]   Like, all the agreements are like
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:01.540]   these Frankenstein monsters of,
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:03.180]   oh, I like his estate planning provisions.
[01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:04.720]   Oh, I like her, you know,
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:07.020]   provisions related to maintaining a life insurance policy
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:09.420]   to secure the alimony award.
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:14.420]   And I wrote this paragraph or this select, this section,
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:17.940]   because what occurred to me is that
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:20.140]   when you have a child with someone,
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.660]   and let's say they're three or four or five,
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:26.100]   they're old enough to know what Christmas is,
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:28.940]   but they're not old enough to go buy a Christmas present.
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:31.840]   But they're old enough to know
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.300]   that you get presents on Christmas
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:35.700]   and you give presents on Christmas,
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:39.600]   but they're not old enough to buy one for the parent.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:42.340]   So someone has to do that for them.
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:47.280]   So I thought, I'm gonna put in a provision that says
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.500]   that as long as the children are so young
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:53.860]   that they can't independently purchase a Mother's Day
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:56.980]   or a birthday present for the co-parent,
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:00.580]   that you'll take the children either to buy a small gift
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:03.920]   or to make a card, something like that.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:06.720]   This struck me as a no-brainer.
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.640]   Who could disagree with this?
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:13.980]   Like, it's not for the person, it's for the kid.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:16.660]   It's so the kid, happy birthday, Mom,
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:17.660]   I don't have a present for you,
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.560]   I don't have a card for you 'cause I'm fucking five.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:21.540]   Like, I'm five.
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:24.480]   Like, the kid can't go do that.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:28.080]   So wouldn't you want your child, not your co-parent,
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:29.240]   who cares, maybe you want them
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.420]   to have the worst birthday ever.
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:33.660]   Fine, but you don't want your child to be embarrassed.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:36.080]   And I even put in the provision,
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.900]   the parties acknowledge that it is the intention
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:42.780]   of this provision to ensure that the child is not embarrassed
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.460]   and feels that they were able to...
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:49.860]   I cannot tell you how many people refuse to sign that.
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:52.460]   How many lawyers said to me, "We're taking that out."
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:54.540]   And I went, "Wait, why?
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:56.160]   "Well, why does my client have to buy a present
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.140]   "for your client?"
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:59.980]   I said, "They're not buying a present for my client,
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:02.200]   "they're buying a present for the child
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.080]   "to give to my client.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.840]   "It could be one of those little $3 boxes of chocolates
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.740]   "they sell at the drugstore."
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:09.260]   Like, it's a kid, they don't know,
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:11.300]   they don't know what anything is.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.780]   And people, nope.
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:17.780]   And I have to tell you, of the conundrums, of the puzzles
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:20.900]   that I can't figure out in existence,
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:21.860]   that's when I can't figure,
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:25.780]   I do not understand why that's so hard.
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.260]   - That's basically just an illustration
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:31.740]   of their complete inability to do anything nice
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:32.660]   for the other person.
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:36.460]   - Like the level of hatred, the level of vitriol.
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:38.060]   Like maybe this is me.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:44.340]   If you apologize, there's not a lot I won't forgive.
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:47.980]   Like I'm not saying I'll forget it,
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:49.420]   I'm not saying, "Oh, we're totally good
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:50.820]   "like it never happened."
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:51.980]   I understand that.
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:56.220]   But if someone says what I call a non-bullshit apology,
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:57.860]   right, like a bullshit apology is,
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:00.060]   "Oh, I'm sorry you got so upset when I did that."
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.820]   Like that's a bullshit apology.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.860]   You know, "I'm sorry that you were offended."
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.540]   That's a bullshit apology.
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:07.860]   Or, "I'm sorry for what I did."
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:09.460]   Because what are we talking about?
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:11.340]   We might not be talking about the same thing.
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:13.900]   Or you might be saying, "I'm sorry that you found out
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.660]   "about that, not that you did it."
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:20.420]   So a real apology is, "I lied to you
[01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:24.540]   "and I realized that that hurt you and I'm really sorry.
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:26.020]   "I shouldn't have done that.
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:27.940]   "I regret that I did that.
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:31.220]   "And I know that it hurt you and I'm really sorry."
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:32.660]   That's a real apology, okay?
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:35.820]   So someone's willing to give you that
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:38.460]   and you still wanna walk around with like
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:42.500]   the level of vitriol that you will harm your child
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:45.700]   rather than do something nice for them,
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:47.500]   I don't have a solution.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.620]   And I have to tell you, I see that all the time.
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:52.580]   Like parental alienation is a thing.
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:53.940]   It is a thing.
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:57.020]   Like children can be weaponized.
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:57.860]   Like I always tell people,
[01:51:57.860 --> 01:51:59.940]   "If you wanna get married, get married.
[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:01.740]   "Get a prenup ideally, but if you don't have a prenup,
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:02.980]   "okay, you're just risking money.
[01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:04.420]   "Don't worry, you're just risking money."
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:08.180]   Money and hassle, you know, of paperwork and of time
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:10.900]   and of going through an ugly financial divorce.
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:12.540]   But you have a kid with somebody,
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:16.340]   that is a missile.
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:20.500]   Like that person has a power over you
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:23.300]   for a long time, if not forever.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:26.700]   So the child could be used as part of a manipulation.
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:29.660]   Routinely.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:30.500]   That's heartbreaking.
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.500]   People weaponize children all the time.
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:36.220]   And they do it with the permission of their own conscience
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:38.660]   because they genuinely believe,
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:42.220]   I'm gonna protect this person, this child from this person
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:45.660]   who by the way, is a bad spouse.
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:48.300]   But that doesn't mean they were a bad father or bad mother.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:51.380]   You can be bad at being a spouse,
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:54.300]   but the skill set of a spouse and of a parent,
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.620]   it's not necessarily the same.
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:01.620]   And I've seen, you know, people alienate children
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:06.780]   from a parent in such subtle ways,
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.180]   but they're so powerful.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:10.780]   And as a lawyer, you know, it doesn't matter what I know,
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:12.820]   it matters what I can prove.
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:16.100]   And it's very hard to prove alienation
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:20.500]   because it's usually a very subtle process.
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.980]   And the example I always give to people is,
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:25.060]   it's a rare kind of crazy person
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.540]   that will say to a seven-year-old,
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:30.020]   "Your dad is a bad person."
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:36.060]   "But this, hello, here's your dad."
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:40.500]   You just said, "Your dad's a bad person."
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.820]   You just did it with your eyes.
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:44.100]   You did it with the expression on your face
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:45.740]   when you handed the phone to the kid.
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:47.780]   You told that kid, "Your dad's a bad person."
[01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:49.260]   You didn't have to say it out loud.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:52.900]   And that is something people are guilty of all the time.
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:56.500]   You know, when the kid comes home and says,
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.340]   you know, there's a divorced couple.
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:01.140]   Kid comes home and says, "Oh, I met mom's new boyfriend."
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:02.380]   And you go, "Oh yeah, that's nice.
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:03.940]   Remember, he's not your dad."
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.460]   You know, like, "Whoa, whoa."
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:08.020]   Like, you just told that kid a whole bunch of information
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:10.620]   about how he's supposed to feel about this person.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:11.980]   Whereas if you go, "Oh, that's nice.
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:12.820]   He's a nice guy.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:13.640]   Oh, that's great.
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:14.480]   I heard nice things.
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.020]   Yeah, I heard he's really, he likes bicycles.
[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:16.860]   That's cool.
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:17.680]   That's really neat."
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:19.800]   Like, you just told this kid, "Okay, it's okay.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:20.780]   You can like this person.
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:22.340]   It's okay to like this person.
[01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:24.780]   It's okay that your mom is with this person."
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:27.780]   Like, and again, whatever you feel about your ex,
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:31.060]   your co-parent, usually you love your kid
[01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:33.420]   more than you hate your ex, ideally.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:36.480]   - Also, I wish people would,
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:38.680]   even without an apology, forgive each other.
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:44.140]   'Cause I, it goes back to the earlier discussion we had.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:49.140]   Like, I usually forgive people if there's something in them,
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:50.800]   especially if we shared something,
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:52.460]   but even just if there's something about them
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:54.060]   that's beautiful.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:56.460]   Like, it's great that they exist in the world.
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.700]   So I'm just grateful for that.
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:02.920]   And I use that as the fuel of forgiveness.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.880]   - I don't know, to me, like forgiveness is very often,
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.380]   it's for me, you know?
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:11.180]   Like when I let go of anger, I feel lighter, you know?
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:14.820]   I think my heart enjoys peace.
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:17.460]   I mean, partly it's 'cause I fight for a living.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:20.080]   You know, I work in the world of conflict.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:22.340]   Like, I jokingly used to say to my sons
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:23.780]   when they were teenagers, you know,
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:26.220]   like, "I can only argue if you've paid."
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:28.460]   Like, it's not fair to the paying customers.
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:33.200]   If I argue with you for free, that's not fair, you know?
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:37.820]   - But I think we were talking about the incredibly
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:41.380]   wide range that a divorce can cost.
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:42.940]   - Yeah, so--
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:45.780]   - And you were saying the cheapest one was the yellow--
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:47.420]   - Yeah, yellow pad, two people,
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:48.820]   came to an agreement, write it up,
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:52.420]   make it legally binding, five grand maybe, you know, tops.
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:55.700]   But usually 3,500, five grand, that kind of vibe.
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:56:00.300]   Most expensive, millions, millions in counsel fees.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:02.660]   - And that's because of the duration, the complexity--
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:04.820]   - Yeah, the duration, the complexity of issues.
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:06.820]   Like, I have clients who've paid
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:09.940]   two, three million in counsel fees to me.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:13.060]   - So it's like as a custody or like, what's the--
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:16.820]   - Well, it can be complex custody that requires a hearing,
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:19.160]   that requires expert testimony,
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:21.280]   dueling mental health professionals,
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:23.900]   opining on the parenting.
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:28.320]   It can be a situation where emergency circumstances occur,
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.160]   like where an individual tries to abscond
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:31.720]   to another country with the children
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:34.920]   and you have to bring them back under the Hague Convention
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:36.560]   on international child abduction.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:37.400]   - Oh, wow.
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:38.760]   - Yeah, we've done some Hague cases.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:43.120]   You know, there are cases where people
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:47.360]   have very different facts.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:50.040]   Like before I came here today,
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:54.800]   a client of mine's soon to be ex-husband
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:55.760]   who she's in the middle of a door,
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:59.720]   he tested positive for cocaine on a hair follicle test
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:01.120]   where it was said he was definitely
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:04.400]   not going to test positive and he tested positive.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.200]   So it was like, we were scurrying now with,
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:08.720]   okay, we gotta get a motion filed,
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:11.700]   we gotta suspend access, we gotta protect the kids,
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:12.800]   we gotta get in front of a judge,
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:14.360]   we gotta think about what are the implications of this
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:15.480]   'cause he was about to transition
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.120]   to an unsupervised parenting.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:21.360]   Like this is the kind of stuff that can amp up
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.080]   the amount of work the lawyer has to do,
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:24.480]   which then translates to money.
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:28.120]   I mean, I get paid for my time, you know,
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:29.960]   and the time of my team, you know,
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:31.760]   I have attorneys and paralegals who work for me.
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:35.700]   So when you have a team of lawyers working on a case,
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:39.480]   you can burn tens of thousands of dollars a day
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:42.060]   if it's a big enough case.
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:45.240]   There are also very complex financial cases.
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:48.320]   You know, people move and hide money.
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:53.320]   The high net worth space is a different world.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:58.400]   Like if an average person owns a home,
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.800]   they own a home in their name
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.680]   or their name with their spouse.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:08.680]   A high net worth person owns an LLC that owns that home.
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.640]   That LLC is owned by a trust.
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:16.560]   They are a beneficial interested party in that trust.
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:19.480]   Like this is how some of my clients who make
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.920]   tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:25.600]   pay less in taxes than a cop or a firefighter
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:28.960]   because they have structures.
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:31.120]   And the structures that were designed
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.240]   for tax planning purposes,
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:38.240]   then in a divorce become very tricky to unwind
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:41.200]   and to figure out, wait, no, what is mine
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:44.140]   and what is not, you know.
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:47.680]   - Well, then that takes us to the question of prenups.
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:50.840]   What's your view on prenups, prenuptial agreements?
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.040]   - It's not popular to quote Kanye West,
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:56.200]   but if you ain't no chump, hollow, we want prenup.
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.120]   We want prenup.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:58.820]   I mean, that's what he had to say.
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:01.920]   - Meaning, so prenup was a good idea.
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.360]   - Prenup is an excellent idea.
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:09.640]   A prenup is a contract between two people
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.040]   that binds their respective rights and obligations
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.920]   in the event of a divorce when it comes to financial issues.
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.360]   That's all it is.
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:21.000]   And there's a lot of reasons to have them.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.200]   And there really aren't any reasons not to have them
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:25.800]   other than the fact it requires
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:27.520]   an uncomfortable conversation.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:31.200]   - So, I mean, there's a few questions here.
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.760]   First, do they work legally in general?
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:34.600]   - Yes.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.580]   If they are crafted correctly,
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:40.320]   which is not that hard to do for a lawyer to do.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:42.080]   I'm saying for a lawyer to do,
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:43.400]   because with the internet,
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:46.120]   everybody thinks, why would I spend $1,000?
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:47.880]   I can just Google prenuptial agreement,
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:49.160]   and I can get one, and then it'll be,
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:50.440]   that is a bad idea.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.800]   Like, it is like a will.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:53.360]   Like, if you're gonna have a document
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:56.480]   that binds your rights at that level,
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:00.080]   it's worth, like, the most expensive prenup
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:02.500]   I've ever done was like three grand.
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:04.680]   That's ridiculous.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:06.440]   That's not a lot of money.
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:09.580]   Like, so there's no reason you wouldn't do it,
[02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:11.300]   but people still, people will still.
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:14.260]   I've had clients that have hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:15.900]   and they did their prenup
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:17.820]   downloading something from the internet.
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:20.660]   And because of some imperfection,
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:21.740]   you know, it doesn't have the right,
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:22.960]   what's called acknowledgement,
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:24.940]   which is the section where the notary signs,
[02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:26.600]   and it has to say that it was duly sworn
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:28.140]   before this person on this date.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:29.980]   And if it doesn't have that, it's invalid.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:30.820]   It's not binding.
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:32.560]   So there are weird technicalities,
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:34.060]   but yeah, prenups are binding.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:37.880]   As long as there has been some minimal asset disclosure,
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:40.000]   which is easily done in a prenup,
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.040]   and as long as there's not a language deficiency,
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:45.400]   meaning that the person who is reading it
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:47.160]   understands English to the level
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:48.720]   that they understand what they're signing,
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:51.560]   and if they don't, that at least they've acknowledged
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:54.900]   in their native language that there is some opportunity
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:56.720]   for this to be translated for them,
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:57.560]   yeah, they're binding.
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:00.000]   They're presumptively binding.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.640]   You know, we live, thankfully, in a culture
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:05.020]   where people are allowed to enter
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.680]   into contracts about money.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:10.260]   - What are some prenups that you've seen
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:15.260]   that can be effective, or that people converge towards
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:18.300]   in terms of what does an agreement look like?
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:21.140]   Because, you know, the popular conception is
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:25.980]   when there's no prenup, both sides get half.
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:29.600]   - And that's generally true, that both sides get half.
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:33.680]   Equitable distribution, which is what the law is called,
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.760]   it's the law of equitable distribution,
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:38.640]   it's not called the law of equal distribution for a reason,
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:40.520]   because it's equitable, not equal.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.880]   Now, equal, like equitable is presumed to be equal,
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.120]   but there are exceptions to that presumption,
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:51.400]   and that's where lawyers can get into fun and/or trouble,
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.280]   depending on how you view it.
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.380]   It's where we make our money.
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:58.840]   We make our money arguing that the fair result
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.900]   will not be just a 50/50 split.
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:05.900]   And so there's the very generic standard prenup,
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:11.720]   which is easy, and I call that yours, mine, and ours.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:14.060]   Like, if it's in your name, it's yours,
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:16.480]   whether it's an asset or a liability.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.280]   My name, it's mine, joint names, we split it 50/50.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:20.480]   Simple, clean.
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:22.960]   And you go in to the marriage now
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.380]   knowing what the rules are.
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:26.420]   So if you get a bonus at work,
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:28.180]   and you put it in your sole name,
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:31.540]   then it's your separate property in the event you divorce.
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.700]   You go out and buy a boat,
[02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:35.260]   and she doesn't support you buying the boat,
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:37.420]   but you got a big loan on this boat.
[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:39.580]   You're responsible for that loan.
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:44.420]   So I like that because I like people having some control,
[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:47.280]   and I also like people having to have discussions.
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:50.380]   Well, why are we putting that bonus just in your bank account?
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:52.180]   Why wouldn't we put it in the joint bank account?
[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:53.940]   We should have that discussion while we're married,
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:56.580]   not when we're in a divorce lawyer's office 10 years later,
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:02:57.620]   because we should be able to talk
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.080]   about those kinds of things.
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.660]   So, you know, what's interesting about prenups
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:08.500]   is that somehow people think there's something,
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:12.180]   like, it takes away from the romance of a marriage.
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:15.180]   But I've said it before, and I'll say it again,
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:16.720]   all marriages end.
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:19.200]   They end in death or divorce.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:22.080]   So having life insurance or having a will,
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:23.860]   it doesn't mean you can't wait to die.
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:25.380]   It doesn't mean you're looking forward to death.
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:28.020]   It doesn't mean that you're predicting,
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:30.660]   you know, your demise sometime imminently.
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:32.140]   It just means that, you know,
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:33.620]   you're being realistic and honest.
[02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:37.980]   So when you marry, and I don't mean spiritually marrying,
[02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:41.660]   having a marriage ceremony, I mean legally marrying,
[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:46.100]   you're making changes to your rights
[02:03:46.100 --> 02:03:47.580]   and obligations under law.
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:48.420]   That's what you're doing.
[02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:51.340]   Like marriage, from a legal standpoint,
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:53.460]   what we mean when we say I got married,
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:57.000]   is a state agency.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.860]   It's been created by the state.
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:02.960]   Like this is a legal status that most people
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:05.980]   who are in it know nothing about.
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:10.260]   They just did the most legally significant thing
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:13.460]   they're ever going to do other than dying,
[02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:17.700]   and they have no idea what rights and obligations
[02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:19.160]   it created in them.
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:21.260]   And the first time they're gonna get an education
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:22.380]   about it is in my office.
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:23.220]   That's crazy.
[02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:24.060]   - When they get divorced.
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:24.880]   - That's crazy.
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.260]   - And so prenup is an opportunity
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:28.940]   to learn something about it at the start.
[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:32.060]   - So first of all, whenever someone approaches me
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:35.080]   about prenups, and that's like four or five times a week,
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:37.260]   probably, depending on the season.
[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:39.340]   Right before wedding season, we get a lot.
[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:40.420]   - When's wedding season?
[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:42.340]   - Well, it used to just be the summer.
[02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.100]   You know, they say when you marry in June,
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:45.300]   you're a bride all your life.
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:48.460]   That's from some Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:49.940]   Now the fall is very big too.
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:52.140]   People love fall content, fall weddings,
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:54.580]   pretty pictures and things.
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:55.420]   - Content.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:56.240]   - Yeah, fall content.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.080]   - It's good on the 'gram.
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:57.920]   - Hashtag fall content.
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:04:58.740]   - All right, that's a hashtag.
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:00.260]   - Weddings is for the 'gram.
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:03.040]   I have to tell you, weddings is performative, man.
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:05.220]   See, the problem is though, it's curated.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.940]   So here's us picking the cake.
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:08.580]   It's not here's us doing the prenup.
[02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:11.620]   You know how many people I've done prenups for
[02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:13.380]   that I've watched on their social media
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:16.860]   or them being interviewed by Andy Cohen on Bravo
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:18.500]   and saying, "Well, no, we don't have a prenup."
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:19.340]   Yeah, you do.
[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:21.700]   You do, it's in my office, it's in a folder.
[02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:22.540]   - Yeah.
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:23.380]   - They have a prenup.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:24.200]   - I didn't even know, that's beautiful.
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:26.980]   - But prenups are not published anyplace.
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:28.300]   They're not filed with a court.
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.420]   They're maintained by the two people that signed it
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:32.300]   and they're lawyers, that's it.
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:33.940]   So nobody has to admit that they have a prenup.
[02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:34.780]   - Beautiful.
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:37.620]   - But there's a, yes, but there's a certain problem
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:41.540]   with that in so far as a lot of people have prenups
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:43.860]   and we need to normalize prenups.
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.900]   Like there's no reason not to normalize prenups.
[02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:47.860]   There's no reason not for,
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:50.780]   until some famous people say, "Yeah, we have a prenup.
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:52.040]   "We're crazy about each other.
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:53.600]   "It's why we're getting married.
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:55.540]   "But yeah, look, we're getting,
[02:05:55.540 --> 02:05:58.500]   "I don't wanna get a car accident, but I got a seatbelt."
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:01.180]   Like you have it just in case.
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:06.180]   - And I mean, what do you do if you're running a company?
[02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:09.980]   Like what does that have to do with a prenup?
[02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:12.220]   You're running a hundred billion dollar
[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:14.640]   or trillion dollar company, Jeff Bezos.
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:18.420]   I suppose his marriage was before Amazon.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:20.260]   - Yeah, his was before it was anything.
[02:06:20.260 --> 02:06:22.860]   - But like, how does that work in a prenup?
[02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:25.020]   - Well, no, actually it's the same.
[02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:29.660]   I mean, what you're doing with a prenup
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:34.420]   is you're identifying how things
[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:36.580]   will be classified in advance.
[02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:39.740]   So you're creating a set of rules
[02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:43.580]   and then you both can function under those rules
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:44.420]   during the marriage.
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:45.980]   So like I, for a brief time,
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:50.300]   I taught a family law drafting class at a law school.
[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:52.380]   And when we would do separation agreements
[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:55.260]   and we would do pleadings, it was lots of fun.
[02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:57.420]   When we would do prenups, I would say to the students,
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:00.760]   "What's the main thing you need when you're doing a prenup?"
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:03.060]   And they would say, "Well, you need asset disclosure."
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:04.340]   And I'd say, "Well, that's not the main thing."
[02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:07.540]   And they'd say, "Well, you need technical languages."
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:10.740]   I'd say, "Nope, main thing you need is a crystal ball.
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.300]   "And the main thing you need is the ability
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:13.920]   "to see what's gonna happen in the future.
[02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:15.260]   "Who's gonna have money, who's not,
[02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:17.220]   "who's gonna be successful, who isn't,
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:18.820]   "what people will inherit."
[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:20.740]   Problem is we don't have that.
[02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:21.560]   We don't have that.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:22.460]   So what can we do?
[02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:25.180]   We can create tranches, we can create structures,
[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:27.060]   we can create systems.
[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:30.100]   And then people can live with those in mind.
[02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:33.340]   You enter the game knowing the rules, right?
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:37.560]   So you know if this is gonna be a submission-only event.
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:39.260]   You know if this is gonna be no time limit.
[02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:40.980]   You know if we're after a certain number of minutes,
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.860]   we're going into points now, okay?
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:44.740]   So I can work with that rule set
[02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:48.100]   and I'm gonna amend my game based on that rule set.
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:50.420]   Same thing, same thing.
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:52.700]   You're just gonna say, "Look, what's the rule set?
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:54.460]   "Let's agree on the rule set.
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:57.240]   "And then let's conduct ourselves
[02:07:57.240 --> 02:07:58.720]   "with the rule set in mind.
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:01.540]   "Let's plan the rule set in mind."
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.700]   And I think that, you know, and by the way,
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:04.540]   and if you're gonna cheat,
[02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:05.660]   you cheat with the rule set in mind.
[02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:06.940]   You know you're cheating, right?
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:10.120]   You know you're trying to get around the rule set.
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:15.040]   So prenups are, when I do a consult for a prenup,
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.280]   the first thing I do is,
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:18.160]   "Here's what's gonna happen legally
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:20.300]   "if you marry without a prenup.
[02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:23.520]   "Here's what happens to your rights and obligations."
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:28.400]   Then what we can change with that, there's almost no limit.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:31.160]   You can amend anything you want to.
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:33.120]   The example I always give is there was a case
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:36.120]   that went up to the appellate court
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:39.880]   where a high net worth guy married a very beautiful woman
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:41.840]   and there was a provision in the prenuptial agreement
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:45.080]   that said for every 10 pounds she gained during the marriage
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.760]   she would lose $10,000 a month in alimony if they divorced.
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:53.600]   And here's her baseline weight
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:55.560]   as of the time of execution of this agreement.
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:58.400]   And I wondered if she did like what a wrestler does.
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.960]   Like did she like, you know,
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:01.880]   did she like bulk up right before
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:04.080]   and then cut when she eventually got divorced?
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:07.080]   Like is she in there with sauna, you know, with the suit on?
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:10.580]   But, and the appellate court essentially said,
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:14.160]   "I don't know why you married this person
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:17.720]   "having had them make you sign this, but it's binding."
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:18.760]   Yeah. But it's binding.
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:20.320]   I wish somebody would do a contract like that.
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:23.400]   Like the rent for this place would be more expensive
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.960]   if I was fatter and cheaper if I was skinnier.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.680]   And that way I would have to weigh in.
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:29.760]   Yeah, weigh in on it.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:31.760]   Well, it would keep like some motivation on you.
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:32.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:35.400]   That kind of prenup is motivating.
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.760]   Well, I think Tim Ferriss says that
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.220]   about how he does like,
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:42.280]   he said you should make bets with people.
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:43.920]   Like, it's like, if you gain this much,
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:46.000]   I got to give you this amount of money, you know?
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.760]   I think he says that in one of his early books.
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:50.600]   And try to make it binding somehow, which is tough.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:54.320]   Yeah, I think when we create incentives of that kind,
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:57.760]   you know, that's why like there was like the no nut November,
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:00.960]   no shave November, you know, sober, like all this.
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.280]   It was a competition.
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.080]   When people make a competition of something,
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:05.440]   they gamify something.
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:07.040]   It makes it something that people
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:08.200]   are more likely to stick with.
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:12.000]   So, I mean, I guess a prenup be interesting.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.280]   The problem is there's also,
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.760]   people put in prenups what's called fidelity clauses.
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:17.720]   Uh-oh.
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:18.560]   Yeah.
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:19.380]   Yeah, it was, yeah.
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:21.280]   Fidelity clauses, people still do these.
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:22.840]   I discourage people from doing them.
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:24.920]   The two things that people put in prenups
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:27.020]   that I discourage people from putting in prenups,
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:29.000]   but very often people still put in prenups,
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.360]   even with my caveat,
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:33.520]   is fidelity clauses and sunset clauses.
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:35.400]   So, fidelity clauses is,
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:38.720]   I'm waving alimony, I'm waving this, I'm waving that,
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.020]   but if you cheat, I get a million bucks
[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:45.180]   or I get this much alimony or I get this amount.
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:49.720]   And I know the intention is to disincentivize
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:50.920]   the person from cheating.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:54.000]   It's a deterrent to have them cheat.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.280]   But all it really does is just creates like
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:58.600]   an interesting legal battle for lawyers.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:01.520]   Like how did you prove that they cheated or not?
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:03.400]   Oh, right, 'cause what, yeah,
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:04.960]   what constitutes cheating also.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:05.840]   Right, right.
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.440]   Is it an emotional affair, an affair?
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:09.040]   Is oral sex cheating?
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.640]   Is, you know, like what is,
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:13.800]   and by the way, how do you prove it?
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.360]   Like, well, I was in a hotel with her,
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:16.960]   but how do you prove that I had sex with her?
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:20.680]   You know, like, and it's very, very,
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:23.500]   you're opening a can of worms with that kind of a thing,
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:25.440]   but people sometimes still put them in.
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:27.760]   And sunset clauses.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:30.720]   Sunset clauses is if we're married X period of time,
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.120]   this goes away, is if it never existed.
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:34.680]   And why is that a bad idea?
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:37.040]   The same reason the community property law
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.680]   in California is a bad idea.
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:40.520]   So the community property law is,
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:43.340]   after a certain number of years, I think it's seven,
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:46.560]   everything, including your premarital property,
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:48.020]   all becomes marital property.
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:51.140]   And the idea of that was supposed to be
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:53.920]   that if you've been married that number of years,
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:57.460]   like you're in enough of a serious relationship now
[02:11:57.460 --> 02:12:01.640]   that everything is one unit, you're one person.
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:03.480]   What it actually does is creates
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:06.160]   a very uncomfortable thought experiment
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.460]   that people have to have at the six year mark.
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:12.760]   Because you have to, now the honeymoon's kind of over,
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:15.760]   you might have a kid or two, and you go,
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:20.760]   okay, wait a minute, am I so happy in this relationship
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:24.320]   that I'm willing to take all of my premarital assets
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:25.560]   and throw them in the pot right now?
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:27.920]   'Cause if not, I got six months to get divorced.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:28.760]   Yeah.
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:31.720]   Like, and that's not, so like if you say to someone,
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:34.360]   like if you got married tomorrow,
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:37.600]   and then you found a company that's worth $100 million,
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:43.880]   and under your prenup, that's your separate property,
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:47.840]   but there's a sunset clause that says
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:50.480]   that your prenup goes out the window in 15 years.
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:53.240]   Man, at year 14 in six months,
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:55.060]   you gotta ask yourself some serious questions
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:57.400]   about where's this relationship gonna be in five, 10 years.
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:58.240]   - That's brilliant.
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:00.840]   And that's why, kids, you pay for a lawyer.
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:01.760]   - That's it.
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:03.720]   We get paid to see around corners, you know?
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:04.800]   I get paid to be paranoid.
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:06.200]   I tell people that all the time.
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:08.200]   - Okay, so you just mentioned infidelity.
[02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:10.440]   You write in the book, which everybody should get.
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:11.880]   It's a great book, it's a great read.
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.920]   It's a window into your soul.
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:16.200]   You, in this book, write that there's
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:18.000]   five kinds of infidelity.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.640]   Do you remember, can you explain?
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:21.840]   - Yeah, I mean, what I wanted to say
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:23.800]   is that all infidelity's not the same,
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:25.460]   that there's different kinds.
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:28.220]   And some of them are more obvious than others.
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:33.220]   Like, there's the soulmate, you know?
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:36.540]   That's the one I think I see most often,
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:38.700]   which is a person meets another person
[02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:42.940]   or rekindles on social media or elsewhere
[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:46.300]   a reconnection with another person in their life,
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:49.300]   and they go, oh my God, this is the person
[02:13:49.300 --> 02:13:50.620]   I'm supposed to be with.
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:51.540]   I'm in love.
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:53.180]   The heart wants what the heart wants.
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:55.480]   Like, I'm leaving you for this person
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:57.340]   'cause I have found my true love.
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:14:00.100]   That's one type, and it's an incredibly common type.
[02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:03.700]   And there's, you know, there are plenty
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:06.140]   of cautionary tales associated with that,
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:08.760]   where people thought that they found their someone,
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:11.100]   and then it turns out it was, you know,
[02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:13.660]   no, it was just unfair, you know?
[02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:16.260]   And, you know, a man who leaves his wife
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:20.060]   for his mistress just leaves a new job opportunity open.
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.300]   - And we should also mention that you, you know,
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:24.260]   talk about Facebook and Instagram.
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:25.100]   - Oh, yes.
[02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:28.100]   If we were going to invent an infidelity-generating machine,
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:30.300]   it would be called Facebook, which, by the way,
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:32.840]   is a function of the fact the book was written in 2019.
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:34.620]   I would now change it to Instagram.
[02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:36.060]   - Oh, 'cause you said just Facebook.
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:37.860]   - Yes, but now, if I had to rewrite it,
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:38.940]   it would be if we were gonna invent
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:41.500]   an infidelity-generating machine, it would be called Meta.
[02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:42.340]   That would be what I would have.
[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:43.180]   - Yeah, there you go.
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:44.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.140]   - Very tech forward.
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:48.180]   - It was a function of what Facebook
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:50.200]   and I think Instagram also are,
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:53.060]   which is it is a communication tool
[02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:55.480]   that has people looking into windows
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:58.160]   that I think are antagonistic to marriage.
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:00.720]   You're looking into the lives of other people.
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:05.120]   You're looking into the social lives
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.380]   of people that you meet casually.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:09.220]   So there was a time where you would be
[02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:11.300]   at your son's soccer practice
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:14.480]   and see the attractive mom across the way,
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:17.020]   and you wouldn't really talk to her or interact with her.
[02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:20.020]   If you did, it would just be at practice.
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:23.860]   But now, we add on social media those people
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:25.260]   because for legitimate reasons.
[02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:27.460]   We need to maybe communicate about when practice is
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:29.340]   or we wanna message the person.
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:32.540]   But now it's sort of an invitation to a connection.
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:34.140]   And then it's, you know,
[02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:36.540]   there's a picture of her on vacation in a bikini.
[02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:37.620]   That's very intriguing.
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:39.500]   And then you have a benign,
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:40.700]   oh, I saw you guys went on vacation.
[02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:41.740]   Where did you stay?
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:42.780]   You know, oh, was it good?
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:43.620]   Did you like that?
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:44.440]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:46.540]   And now we're talking and now we're having an interaction.
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:50.980]   And now this is how the spark of affairs begins.
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:52.740]   It's usually, people don't usually meet and go,
[02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:54.900]   would you like to potentially wreck your marriage?
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:55.740]   Yes, would you?
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:57.060]   Oh my God, let's do this.
[02:15:57.060 --> 02:15:59.540]   Like it's much more, you know, it's slowly happens.
[02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:02.400]   So when I talk about types of infidelity,
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:05.940]   the soulmate, the unexpected soulmate, you know,
[02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:08.620]   this connection that you didn't expect.
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:10.940]   I didn't expect to fall in love with this person,
[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:12.820]   but I did and the heart wants what the heart wants
[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:13.660]   and I'm sorry.
[02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:16.180]   That one's tough.
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:18.940]   That one's tough because, you know,
[02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:22.140]   it's an interesting distinction between men and women
[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:26.800]   to some degree that when a man finds out
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:30.060]   his wife was cheating, the question is, did you fuck him?
[02:16:30.060 --> 02:16:33.300]   And when a woman finds out that a man cheated,
[02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:34.940]   the question is, do you love her?
[02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:39.940]   You know, and those are different things, you know.
[02:16:39.940 --> 02:16:41.220]   I feel like there could be many
[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:43.140]   and have been many books written on that.
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:45.620]   Yeah, there have been by much smarter people than me.
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:46.460]   Yeah.
[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:51.460]   But I think that the soulmate thing
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:57.860]   is very, very painful for a lot of my female clients.
[02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:00.460]   When a man says, listen, I found the one,
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:02.180]   I found the one and it's not you.
[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:06.500]   That is really, really hard to get past.
[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:11.740]   Even when it turned out to be true.
[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:14.420]   I mean, I've seen some people that, you know,
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:18.580]   it was an affair that turned into 20 plus year marriages.
[02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:23.460]   You know, so an unhappy marriage and then a happy affair
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:25.260]   that turned into a very happy marriage.
[02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:27.900]   Like I've not seen, there's not a formula, you know.
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:30.300]   Like I've been doing it long enough now
[02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:34.400]   that I've seen permutations I never would have expected.
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:37.380]   So that's one type of infidelity.
[02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:39.900]   The other is what I call the push out of the closet,
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:42.740]   which is, and that I think happened more often
[02:17:42.740 --> 02:17:43.940]   earlier in my career.
[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:45.580]   There have been tremendous strides, I think,
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:48.740]   in the lesbian and gay community,
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:52.300]   where, including marriage equality, obviously,
[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:56.360]   where there's a lot of change as to people accepting people
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:57.660]   as being gay or lesbian.
[02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:03.220]   And I think that there was a time where, you know,
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:05.900]   people were having, being in the closet
[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:06.860]   was much more important.
[02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:09.140]   You were subject to professional scorn
[02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:10.500]   and, you know, all kinds of things
[02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:11.980]   if you were gay or lesbian.
[02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:15.940]   So people were sneaking around and having affairs
[02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:18.860]   with their same-sex partners, and then they get caught.
[02:18:18.860 --> 02:18:20.980]   And then, you know, it really was a function
[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:24.540]   of the fact that they were closeted.
[02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:27.780]   And again, that's another kind of complicated dynamic
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:32.420]   because, you know, I haven't had that happen to me,
[02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:34.160]   where a woman left me for a woman,
[02:18:34.160 --> 02:18:40.020]   but I'd like to think it would be easier for me.
[02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:43.660]   Because if you left me for a man,
[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:46.700]   you're saying I want one like you, but better than you.
[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:50.620]   Whereas if you leave me for a woman,
[02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:52.900]   well, that's a whole different set of equipment.
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:54.100]   I don't have that.
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:56.540]   So like, I can't, like, okay.
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:58.020]   Like, it's not me, it's you.
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:00.220]   It's something you want that I can't offer.
[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:01.740]   We don't serve that at this restaurant,
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:03.300]   so, you know, it's okay.
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:04.980]   Like, I get it.
[02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:06.980]   I mean, there's a betrayal, there's a sadness, whatever,
[02:19:06.980 --> 02:19:09.620]   but, you know, it's a different thing.
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:15.620]   The saddest type of infidelity, in my opinion,
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:18.820]   is the mistake, which is someone just makes a mistake.
[02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:22.860]   People do dumb shit when it comes to sex.
[02:19:22.860 --> 02:19:26.900]   Like, people just, in a moment, you know,
[02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:31.900]   they follow temptation, their impulse control is poor,
[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:34.900]   you know, and they do something
[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:38.220]   that doesn't reflect their morality
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:40.940]   or doesn't reflect the depth of their feelings.
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:42.580]   Like, if you spend enough time in a room
[02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:45.900]   with people who've cheated in a relationship
[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:47.460]   and are speaking candidly to you about it
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:48.860]   'cause you're their lawyer,
[02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:52.180]   they'll say to you very openly,
[02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:54.460]   like, no, I really love my wife.
[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:55.620]   I really love my wife.
[02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:57.500]   Like, I just, I don't know, I was just an idiot.
[02:19:57.500 --> 02:20:00.420]   Like, I just, you know, I saw this bright, shiny object
[02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:01.260]   and I went for it.
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:03.100]   I really wanted to sleep with that woman.
[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:05.940]   Like, I wanted to fuck her.
[02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:06.900]   I love my wife.
[02:20:06.900 --> 02:20:08.220]   I make love to my wife.
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:10.980]   I love my wife, but I just wanna sleep with this one.
[02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:13.860]   You know, and we created a culture
[02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:17.140]   where one of those eradicates the other.
[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:20.420]   That's a whole 'nother discussion,
[02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:22.900]   is, you know, or is there ethical non-monogamy?
[02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:27.900]   Like, should we, is marriage about who I have sex with
[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:32.300]   or is marriage a different kind of a partnership?
[02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:36.740]   Is it a pair bond that's about building a life together?
[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:39.620]   You know, and where does monogamy fit into that?
[02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:41.140]   And people like Esther Perel,
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:43.420]   and those are people who are making
[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:48.100]   very intelligent discussions about that, you know.
[02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:49.060]   - Yeah, that's a complicated one.
[02:20:49.060 --> 02:20:50.780]   Just to actually just linger on that,
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:55.660]   a view, how often have people with open marriages
[02:20:55.660 --> 02:20:57.020]   have been in your office?
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:00.100]   - Well, let's see, and this is one of those, like,
[02:21:00.100 --> 02:21:03.060]   from a research perspective, this would be flawed.
[02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:06.260]   Because I see the, they're in my office
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:08.220]   'cause their marriage is falling apart.
[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:13.220]   So there may be lots of people having open relationships
[02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:15.340]   that don't end up in a divorce lawyer's office,
[02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:16.700]   so I'd never meet them.
[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:21.700]   But I meet a lot of people that that was the Hail Mary pass.
[02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:22.540]   - Sure.
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:24.820]   - Like, I meet a lot of people that they tried that,
[02:21:24.820 --> 02:21:27.940]   but in retrospect, it was a Hail Mary pass.
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:30.620]   It was like, look, we've just figured, let's try this.
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:34.140]   You know, like, maybe this'll keep the glue together
[02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:35.380]   on this thing, you know.
[02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:40.380]   And I've also seen open relationships go wrong,
[02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:44.460]   you know, where we agree we're just gonna have
[02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:46.620]   sexual connections with other people,
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:49.900]   or we're gonna bring other people into the bedroom.
[02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:51.900]   But together, like, we're gonna be together
[02:21:51.900 --> 02:21:54.540]   with other people or with another person.
[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:59.020]   And then that connection of those two people,
[02:21:59.020 --> 02:22:02.580]   like, you think it's a soulmate all of a sudden now,
[02:22:02.580 --> 02:22:03.420]   and it goes in this other,
[02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:05.580]   because, and again, is that novelty?
[02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:07.780]   Is that, like, it's the reason why I don't understand
[02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:09.020]   why people have threesomes.
[02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:12.220]   It's kind of like, you know, when someone sings to you,
[02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:14.140]   I don't know where to look.
[02:22:14.140 --> 02:22:15.020]   Like, I don't know where to look.
[02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:16.260]   Like, if someone's singing to me,
[02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:17.140]   I don't know where to look.
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:18.820]   Like, it feels weird, right?
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:20.940]   Like, this is a conundrum I have.
[02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:21.780]   No, this.
[02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:25.140]   I'll say this to you, this'll never,
[02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:27.460]   but it's the reason I can't go to strip clubs.
[02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:28.300]   - Yeah.
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:30.140]   - I don't know where to look.
[02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:31.660]   Like, if I go to a strip club, you know,
[02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:33.780]   like, you go to a strip club and there's, you know,
[02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:36.060]   the part where the woman's on the stage
[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:37.620]   and she walks past each person,
[02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:39.140]   just does a little thing, and then next person,
[02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:40.700]   and then this little thing.
[02:22:40.700 --> 02:22:42.540]   So when she's right in front of you,
[02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:46.540]   I like a woman's face and I like a woman's body.
[02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:47.820]   I like both of them.
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:49.380]   So I'm looking at the woman's face,
[02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:51.540]   and she's very beautiful, but she's naked.
[02:22:51.540 --> 02:22:52.940]   And I think, oh, she's naked.
[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:54.340]   I should be looking at her naked body,
[02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:56.860]   because obviously that's like, it's almost rude not to,
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:59.140]   because she's naked in front of me, of course.
[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:00.700]   So then I'm looking at her naked body,
[02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:02.300]   which is lovely to look at.
[02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:05.100]   But then I find myself going, oh my God, you're just,
[02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:06.620]   you should look at her face, for God's sake.
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:08.700]   And then I look at her face and find myself
[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:11.060]   having this whole thing in my head,
[02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:11.900]   where I'm going like, oh my God,
[02:23:11.900 --> 02:23:13.380]   where am I supposed to look?
[02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:17.580]   So I think a threesome with two women
[02:23:17.580 --> 02:23:21.020]   you don't hardly know or you're not, that's different.
[02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:25.380]   But a threesome with a long-term partner
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:27.380]   who you're in a relationship with,
[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:32.380]   and a new person, seems to me a very dangerous ground.
[02:23:32.380 --> 02:23:35.500]   Because you're gonna want to enjoy the novelty
[02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:39.580]   of this new person, but you're gonna have to spend time
[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:41.820]   with this person after.
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:44.620]   So how much attention do you spend
[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:46.860]   to the new novel, exciting thing,
[02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:49.860]   without creating the impression that you don't,
[02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:51.100]   you're not interested in this?
[02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:53.460]   'Cause you want, you're my favorite person,
[02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.860]   but this is fun, so I wanna just try this for a few.
[02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:57.900]   But then also, I don't wanna forget about that,
[02:23:57.900 --> 02:23:59.660]   like it just seems tricky.
[02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:01.420]   - That analogy, by the way, is brilliant.
[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:03.020]   And also, I guess it's tricky
[02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:06.060]   because the consequences of mistakes are quite high,
[02:24:06.060 --> 02:24:08.660]   'cause you're gonna have to talk about it.
[02:24:08.660 --> 02:24:10.300]   - Right, and there's an easy way
[02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:12.180]   to misinterpret the data, right?
[02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:16.940]   Like so if I really like sleeping with my partner,
[02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:20.660]   but I get one chance to sleep with this other person,
[02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:22.780]   like, well, of course I should indulge in that,
[02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:24.460]   because I can do this anytime.
[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:30.140]   But this person, my partner, might interpret that as,
[02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:32.500]   oh, so you're more interested in her than me,
[02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:34.300]   because that voice in my partner
[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:37.580]   that would be insecure might hear that.
[02:24:37.580 --> 02:24:39.220]   So I just, why would you even,
[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:42.980]   why would you open yourself up to that level of chaos?
[02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:44.580]   - You seem to love chess in the courtroom.
[02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:48.020]   So it's a kind of intimate human chess of sorts.
[02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:50.180]   - Yeah, no, that's too high risk.
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:51.260]   - How do we get on threesomes?
[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:53.140]   Oh, open marriages.
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:54.820]   - Well, we gotta, how do we get on threesomes?
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:55.660]   I don't know, I always wonder
[02:24:55.660 --> 02:24:57.620]   how people get on threesomes.
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:00.180]   I think if one is fun, two must be better.
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:02.180]   If two is better, three must be better.
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:07.180]   Yeah, I think the way that this becomes an issue
[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:12.100]   is why would you have a non-monogamous relationship?
[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:15.420]   What is it about your sex life
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:17.660]   with this person that's not satisfying?
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:19.780]   And I think that that is the question
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:21.100]   that's harder to ask yourself
[02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:23.020]   and to try to answer with your partner.
[02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:25.940]   - I mean, you've said that this idea of soulmates
[02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:29.300]   is great for your business,
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:34.300]   but so like a human being in a partnership
[02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:35.980]   can't be everything.
[02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:37.060]   Is that true?
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:38.340]   - I think it's unrealistic.
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:40.460]   - True romance, right?
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:44.980]   The document that we keep referencing here.
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:45.940]   - I think it's wonderful that we do,
[02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:49.620]   'cause sometimes now people don't get that reference anymore.
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:51.020]   Like I talk to people,
[02:25:51.020 --> 02:25:53.660]   when I try to teach negotiation to young lawyers
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:55.500]   who come work for me,
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:59.380]   I tell them to watch the Gary Oldman scene
[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:01.820]   where he offers them the Chinese food.
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:04.500]   - Yeah, why is that scene the one that really?
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:07.340]   - Because it's the best negotiating lesson
[02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:08.820]   I've ever heard in my life.
[02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:10.860]   Where he comes in and he--
[02:26:10.860 --> 02:26:12.220]   - Oh, so just for the record.
[02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:14.300]   - Yeah, Gary Oldman plays a pimp.
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:18.780]   And he owns, his girl is Patricia Arquette, right?
[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:22.060]   And Christian Slater's character, the protagonist,
[02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:25.060]   is coming in to tell Gary Oldman
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:29.620]   that he no longer owns this girl, Alabama is her name.
[02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:32.460]   Alabama is gonna be with him now.
[02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:37.860]   And Gary Oldman is a amazing performance.
[02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:40.420]   And he's sitting in a living room
[02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:42.260]   with a shotgun next to him,
[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:44.540]   with armed guys around him,
[02:26:44.540 --> 02:26:48.300]   watching television and eating Chinese food.
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:50.620]   And he's got Chinese food laid out in front of him.
[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:52.340]   And Christian Slater comes in and he says,
[02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:56.140]   "I need to talk to you about Alabama."
[02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:59.100]   And Gary Oldman says, "Do you want some Chinese food?"
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:01.820]   And Christian Slater's sort of taken aback by the question.
[02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:04.780]   He says, "No, I came to talk about Alabama.
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:05.900]   "She's with me now."
[02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:07.420]   She's there and he proceeds to tell him
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:09.420]   what his offer essentially is.
[02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:13.060]   And Gary Oldman says, "You know you fucked up, right?"
[02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:14.620]   In some and substance he says,
[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:17.500]   "You know, if you'd sat down
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:20.220]   "and started eating my Chinese food,
[02:27:20.220 --> 02:27:23.380]   "I would have thought, who's this guy?
[02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:24.740]   "He didn't have a care in the world,
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:26.980]   "just sitting down eating my egg foo young.
[02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:29.180]   "But instead you tried to be hard
[02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:31.180]   "and now I know you're full of shit."
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:36.180]   And so I think that scene summarizes how in negotiation,
[02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:40.260]   the more you enter into it with that,
[02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:42.340]   like anytime I deal with another lawyer
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:44.300]   and they're like, "Well, we'll see you in court."
[02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:46.540]   Okay, see you in court.
[02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:48.340]   Like empty barrels make the most noise.
[02:27:48.340 --> 02:27:49.820]   Like you and I as people who've been
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:53.700]   in the jujitsu community, I know some dangerous people.
[02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:55.780]   I know FBI SWAT people.
[02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:58.220]   I know people that are,
[02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:00.460]   they know how to do things to people.
[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:04.220]   And they're the calmest guys you ever meet in your life.
[02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:06.220]   You scuff their sneaker, they,
[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:07.780]   "Oh, yeah, don't worry about it, man, it's okay."
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:09.660]   Like they're quick to apology.
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:10.860]   Like they're just chill.
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:13.620]   - What were we talking about?
[02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:15.540]   - We were talking about--
[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:18.100]   - Oh, wait, true romance.
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:19.100]   Oh, the soulmate.
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:19.940]   - Yeah, soulmate.
[02:28:19.940 --> 02:28:21.220]   Yeah, well, you're saying that this idea,
[02:28:21.220 --> 02:28:22.980]   like with that film underlying,
[02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:25.100]   there's this current of like they were made for each other.
[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:26.620]   - Yeah.
[02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:30.740]   - I think there's a distinction between the feeling
[02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:32.820]   that someone is your missing puzzle piece,
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:34.500]   that you're made for this person.
[02:28:34.500 --> 02:28:36.420]   I think what that just means is there's a lot
[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:39.740]   of overlapping beautiful connections.
[02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:43.220]   I love them intellectually, I love them sexually,
[02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:45.260]   I love them interpersonally.
[02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:47.900]   We have some shared history,
[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:50.140]   we have some shared commonalities.
[02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:51.500]   We were raised in the same culture,
[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:53.020]   raised in the same religion.
[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:55.900]   Like we view, we have politically similar ideas.
[02:28:55.900 --> 02:28:58.980]   Like these are all, or we have totally opposite ones,
[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:00.300]   but they're complementary.
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:01.780]   Like I've always joked that like finding someone
[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:03.500]   with complementary pathologies,
[02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:07.060]   like I'm obsessively disciplined.
[02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:09.740]   So having a partner who's like flexible
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:12.740]   and like spontaneous is really good for me.
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:16.300]   And also me being like, no, no, no, come on, come back,
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:17.340]   we're gonna do this now.
[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:19.460]   No, no, it's time to actually do this now.
[02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:21.500]   Like we're good for each other, it's barefoot in the park.
[02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:23.060]   You know, it's this idea of like, you know,
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:24.260]   the yin and the yang.
[02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:28.900]   So what I have an issue with is that the definition
[02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:32.940]   of soulmate that I think is sold to so many people now
[02:29:32.940 --> 02:29:37.660]   is this idea that if your partner is disappointing to you
[02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:40.100]   in any way, meaning they're not the perfect
[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:42.140]   travel companion, they're not the perfect
[02:29:42.140 --> 02:29:45.780]   vocabulary companion, they're not the perfect roommate,
[02:29:45.780 --> 02:29:47.620]   they're not the perfect lover, they're not the,
[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:51.020]   like the odds of someone being all of those
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:52.580]   seems crazy to me.
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:54.780]   Like it's infinitesimally small
[02:29:54.780 --> 02:29:57.580]   and they don't have to be everything.
[02:29:57.580 --> 02:30:02.460]   Like if I go to a restaurant and eat 10 courses
[02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:05.420]   and one of them is kind of subpar
[02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:07.820]   and the other nine are the most amazing
[02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:10.420]   culinary experience I've ever had,
[02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:13.580]   how dare I say, well, that wasn't the right restaurant.
[02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:14.660]   Like, what do you mean?
[02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:16.180]   Like, that's a great restaurant.
[02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:17.140]   What are you talking about?
[02:30:17.140 --> 02:30:18.740]   Like, of course there was one little thing.
[02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:21.500]   So I think it's impossible
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:24.620]   to have someone never disappoint you.
[02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:27.900]   It's impossible to have someone who never lets you down
[02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:29.940]   or doesn't say and do the exact right thing
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:30.980]   at the exact right time.
[02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:34.580]   And to create the idea or expectation in anyone
[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:36.820]   that your partner should never let you down,
[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:41.140]   never disappoint you, never not know what to say
[02:30:41.140 --> 02:30:42.220]   is I think crazy.
[02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:44.900]   I mean, I find for myself,
[02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:46.780]   when someone for example, loses someone,
[02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:49.580]   when someone loses a family member or a pet,
[02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:53.740]   I often say the same thing to the person.
[02:30:53.740 --> 02:30:56.140]   I'll either talk to them or send them a text or call them
[02:30:56.140 --> 02:31:00.860]   and I'll say, I wish I knew the perfect thing to say
[02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:02.620]   because I would say it right now.
[02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:05.580]   Like, but I know there isn't.
[02:31:05.580 --> 02:31:07.420]   Like, I know that, you know, I don't say that part,
[02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:08.500]   but like, I know there isn't.
[02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:10.820]   Like, there isn't a perfect thing to say.
[02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:12.540]   Like, but if there was a perfect thing to say,
[02:31:12.540 --> 02:31:13.860]   I would say it right now.
[02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:16.740]   Like, love to me is not that you never let this person down,
[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:19.180]   it's that you never wanna let this person down.
[02:31:19.180 --> 02:31:21.100]   You know, it's love is a verb.
[02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:22.660]   You know, like it's this feeling of,
[02:31:22.660 --> 02:31:25.220]   I never want to disappoint you.
[02:31:25.220 --> 02:31:27.540]   I will disappoint you,
[02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:29.420]   but I never want to disappoint you.
[02:31:29.420 --> 02:31:33.660]   I will hurt you, but I never want to hurt you.
[02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:37.220]   When I hurt you, it will be my insecurity, my stupidity,
[02:31:37.220 --> 02:31:40.380]   my humanity that causes me to hurt you,
[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:43.260]   but I will never intentionally hurt you.
[02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:45.140]   You know, I will betray your trust.
[02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:47.500]   I'll never intentionally betray your trust.
[02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:51.020]   Like, I will, by my stupidity, say the wrong thing
[02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:53.580]   or loose lip say something to someone
[02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:55.300]   that you didn't want me to, but it won't be intentional.
[02:31:55.300 --> 02:31:58.500]   I will always try to be on your team.
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:00.740]   That feels to me like a realistic thing.
[02:32:00.740 --> 02:32:02.260]   - Yeah, the intention leads the way,
[02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:06.020]   but there's some aspect of, like, you know,
[02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:08.980]   just like the 10-course meal, that over time,
[02:32:08.980 --> 02:32:13.140]   there's a kind of convergence towards perfection.
[02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:15.700]   And along the way, there's the rose-colored glasses
[02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:17.580]   where you see the beauty and everything.
[02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:20.460]   So it just, it feels,
[02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:26.860]   it's probably destructive just to really internalize
[02:32:26.860 --> 02:32:30.300]   the idea of soulmate because then any imperfections
[02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:33.500]   can make you doubt, can make you step away,
[02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:34.740]   can make you lose the connection.
[02:32:34.740 --> 02:32:37.620]   But it just feels like, I don't know.
[02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:39.060]   - It's too heavy.
[02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:43.700]   It just feels, I feel like when you see a couple
[02:32:43.700 --> 02:32:46.940]   that's 90 years old and they've been together
[02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:51.420]   for 60 years, 70 years, there is, of course,
[02:32:51.420 --> 02:32:55.100]   a temptation to think about all the beauty
[02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:56.840]   that they've seen on that journey together.
[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:58.500]   The children, the grandchildren,
[02:32:58.500 --> 02:33:00.460]   maybe the great-grandchildren,
[02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.220]   all the joy that they've seen,
[02:33:02.220 --> 02:33:05.360]   all the pain they've endured and struggled together.
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:09.660]   But they've also disappointed each other
[02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:12.540]   a whole bunch of times, probably let each other down,
[02:33:12.540 --> 02:33:14.740]   they probably lied to each other a bunch.
[02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:18.380]   And to me, that is a beautiful thing.
[02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:22.380]   It's great in spite of that.
[02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:23.940]   It's great because of that.
[02:33:23.940 --> 02:33:26.720]   They still love each other even though
[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:29.200]   they've been so flawed and imperfect.
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:32.000]   And they're human and they still love each other.
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.900]   They still rode that thing together
[02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:35.960]   because the reasons to do so
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:38.000]   were greater than the reasons to not.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.880]   - We've mentioned some of this,
[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:41.880]   but I'd love to get your opinion
[02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:44.920]   on having seen things gone wrong.
[02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:48.520]   How much, and having mentioned Amber Heard and Johnny Depp,
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:53.520]   how much fighting do you think is okay in a relationship?
[02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:57.100]   And how to resolve the fights
[02:33:57.100 --> 02:34:01.380]   such that they don't escalate to that disconnection?
[02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:03.420]   Is there some wisdom you have for that?
[02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:05.500]   I imagine you've seen some epic fights.
[02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:08.500]   - Yeah, I've seen some crazy fights.
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:13.220]   I have, even on my phone, I have some recordings.
[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:14.980]   'Cause now there's cameras everywhere.
[02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:19.180]   It's like Nest cams and Ring cams.
[02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:21.740]   So a lot of this gets recorded.
[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:25.340]   And people have phones so readily available
[02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:27.500]   that they can record the other person and know it.
[02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:30.620]   And I listen to the way people speak to their,
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:31.780]   first of all, I listen to the way people speak
[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:33.020]   to each other and I'm shocked.
[02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:33.980]   I listen to the way people speak
[02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:35.820]   to their romantic partner, to their spouse,
[02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:38.100]   and I'm blown away.
[02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:38.940]   I'm blown away.
[02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:39.760]   - Disrespect or what?
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:43.900]   - Just disrespect, insults, profanity,
[02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:46.940]   just degradation, just brutality.
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:51.900]   And then to then kind of go on the next day,
[02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:54.460]   you kind of go on like nothing happened.
[02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:55.660]   I'm shocked by it.
[02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:57.660]   I mean, I listen to it and I think,
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:34:59.460]   if someone ever spoke to me that way,
[02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:02.740]   I don't know that I could ever really feel
[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:06.300]   deep connection to them freely.
[02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:10.300]   I would feel so betrayed, that they just so brutal.
[02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:13.860]   I can't imagine speaking to someone that way,
[02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:18.140]   like say, you just, such vicious insults to someone.
[02:35:18.140 --> 02:35:22.700]   But I understand that's how some people communicate perhaps.
[02:35:22.700 --> 02:35:26.820]   I guess the question of how much fighting
[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:30.540]   is too much fighting in the relationship
[02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:32.420]   is for me a bit like the question,
[02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:36.180]   how much sex is enough sex in the relationship?
[02:35:36.180 --> 02:35:41.980]   It depends on the two people and their individual tastes.
[02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:46.980]   But what's problematic is when there is a disconnect
[02:35:46.980 --> 02:35:49.740]   between the two people.
[02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:56.380]   I think it's Annie Hall.
[02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:58.100]   It's one of the Woody Allen films,
[02:35:58.100 --> 02:36:03.000]   where Diane Keaton and Woody Allen
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.040]   are both talking to their respective therapists
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:08.520]   about the relationship, but it's like a split screen.
[02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:12.580]   And she says, "I mean, we have sex all the time.
[02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:14.700]   "We have sex like once a week."
[02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:16.200]   And he goes, "We never have sex.
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:18.060]   "We have sex like once a week."
[02:36:18.060 --> 02:36:21.580]   And it's funny because it's true.
[02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:26.100]   It really is this, they both know the same data,
[02:36:26.100 --> 02:36:27.760]   but they're interpreting that data set
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:28.680]   completely differently.
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:33.680]   And I think the question you have to start asking is,
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:36.300]   Steve Harvey actually once said something funny to me.
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:39.100]   He said that success is not where you are.
[02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:41.980]   Success is where you are in relation to where you started.
[02:36:41.980 --> 02:36:44.860]   He says, "'Cause if success is where you are,
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:46.580]   "Oprah's got us all beat."
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:49.000]   Or maybe Ilan's got us all beat, I don't know.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.300]   But if it's where you are versus where you started,
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:54.260]   'cause there's a lot of people that started on second
[02:36:54.260 --> 02:36:56.660]   and started on third act like they hit a double.
[02:36:56.660 --> 02:36:58.900]   Well, I was given 10 million,
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:00.540]   but then I turned it into 100 million.
[02:37:00.540 --> 02:37:04.340]   Well, the first million is the hardest, so come on.
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:08.340]   But I think the question of how much sex were we having
[02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:10.540]   at the beginning of the relationship,
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:11.940]   that might be the wrong gauge,
[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:13.720]   'cause that's like we couldn't keep our hands off each other
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:15.600]   and we just, it's novelty.
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:19.660]   But how much sex we're having post-children
[02:37:19.660 --> 02:37:22.980]   versus before the children, that might be worth looking at.
[02:37:22.980 --> 02:37:24.060]   How do we compare it?
[02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:27.140]   Am I overweight compared to what?
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:30.060]   When I was 20 and running marathons?
[02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:31.980]   Or most 50-year-old men?
[02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:35.240]   I don't know, I gotta, what do you compare it to?
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:37.820]   So I think fighting, there are some people
[02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:41.140]   that I think they enjoy fighting.
[02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:42.920]   Like they enjoy argument.
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:45.800]   I know people that enjoy political debate.
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:48.020]   I don't particularly enjoy political debate.
[02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:51.640]   Not that I'm not very interested in political concepts,
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:55.220]   economic concepts, I just, I argue for a living.
[02:37:55.220 --> 02:38:00.220]   So in my free time, I don't find argument that enjoyable.
[02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:04.500]   When it's intense, I find discussion more interesting.
[02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:05.340]   - That's so interesting.
[02:38:05.860 --> 02:38:09.540]   You just keep the battle to that particular,
[02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:11.020]   to your main profession.
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:12.620]   And everyone else, they want peace.
[02:38:12.620 --> 02:38:14.540]   - Well, did you ever, Bob Goldthwait,
[02:38:14.540 --> 02:38:17.060]   Bobcat Goldthwait, the comedian, very, very funny.
[02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:18.180]   And he had a whole second chapter
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:19.980]   as like a director and a writer.
[02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:23.060]   But he has this, I saw an interview with him once
[02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:25.020]   where he said, "Yeah," he says, "I'm a comedian.
[02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:25.980]   "I've been a comedian a long time.
[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:27.000]   "People always come up to me and they're like,
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.300]   "'Oh, you're a comedian, do you wanna hear a joke?'"
[02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:30.140]   He's like, "And all I can think is,
[02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:32.140]   "'Oh yeah, that'd be a real fucking treat.'"
[02:38:32.140 --> 02:38:35.260]   Like I haven't heard jokes all day, all night,
[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:38.140]   for years, that would be a real special occasion, yes.
[02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:39.820]   Like I get it, you know?
[02:38:39.820 --> 02:38:42.900]   - Yeah, and I mean, a sadder story,
[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:45.220]   I've been reading quite a bit about Robin Williams
[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:47.500]   and his wife would talk about how quiet
[02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:51.060]   and introspective and thoughtful and intellectual he was
[02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:53.980]   and not really that humorous in his private life.
[02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:56.280]   - But that may be a function of,
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:02.180]   you know, that it is enjoyable to be the other thing.
[02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:05.220]   One of the things I've always thought was very funny
[02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:09.540]   in relationships, my own relationships,
[02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:14.100]   is most women I know who have a husband
[02:39:14.100 --> 02:39:17.640]   who doesn't wear a suit every day for a living.
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:20.940]   When their husband gets dressed up,
[02:39:20.940 --> 02:39:22.940]   like they're going to a wedding or something,
[02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:25.780]   they get like, "Oh my God, look at him," you know?
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:30.260]   And I wear a suit every day, you know?
[02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:31.780]   On the weekends I don't, I wear like jeans
[02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:33.980]   and a black t-shirt, but the rest of the time I wear a suit.
[02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:36.820]   And I remember, I think this has been true
[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:39.940]   in every relationship I've been in since I was a lawyer,
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:42.420]   including my ex-wife, it was always like,
[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:45.260]   if I had on jeans and I wasn't shaven,
[02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:46.420]   it was like, "Look at you."
[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:49.460]   You know, it's like, "Are you kidding me?"
[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:51.780]   Like, "Really?"
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:53.940]   Like, whereas the suit, they wouldn't even notice.
[02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:55.180]   Wouldn't even notice the suit.
[02:39:55.180 --> 02:39:56.660]   - Sometimes the other thing.
[02:39:56.660 --> 02:39:57.500]   - Well, that's what it is.
[02:39:57.500 --> 02:39:58.980]   It's the novelty of the other thing.
[02:39:58.980 --> 02:40:00.660]   So I think that if you're Robin Williams
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:02.460]   and you're like being shot out of a cannon
[02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:04.020]   in terms of your performative style
[02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:05.580]   and your energy and explosive,
[02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:08.020]   yeah, being quiet must be very refreshing.
[02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:11.540]   Like I imagine, you know, incredibly intelligent people
[02:40:11.540 --> 02:40:15.620]   must love just watching stupid humor or having a dumb,
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:18.140]   it's why some of the smartest people I know
[02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:21.740]   like really dumb shit, you know?
[02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:24.020]   It's why like Rick and Morty, I think is brilliant
[02:40:24.020 --> 02:40:27.060]   because it's both smart and dumb.
[02:40:27.060 --> 02:40:28.940]   - Yeah, it's the perfect combination.
[02:40:28.940 --> 02:40:29.900]   - It really is, yeah.
[02:40:29.900 --> 02:40:31.860]   I think it's possibly the perfect show.
[02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:35.780]   - Is there advice you can give to somebody like me
[02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:40.780]   on how to interview well, how to do conversations well?
[02:40:40.780 --> 02:40:44.220]   Do you think there's something transferable
[02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:49.220]   from the courtroom to this setting with complicated people?
[02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:51.580]   - Yeah, I think so.
[02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:54.340]   I think what can be learned about interviewing
[02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:59.340]   is the distillation, like what is most important?
[02:41:01.420 --> 02:41:04.700]   When I hear a story that I have to present to a judge,
[02:41:04.700 --> 02:41:07.060]   the totality of someone's parenting,
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:09.580]   the good of their parenting, the bad of their parenting,
[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:12.500]   the good of the other parent, the bad of the other parent,
[02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:16.380]   I have to sort of boil down what are the best examples
[02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:17.880]   'cause I can't lay it all out.
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:23.940]   And then what greater principle do they speak to?
[02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:26.940]   You know, the best jujitsu teacher
[02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:29.340]   that I think I've had is Paul Schreiner.
[02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:33.940]   And Paul doesn't just teach you techniques.
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:37.300]   He's teaching you ways of thinking about concepts
[02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:40.220]   in jujitsu and then here are some techniques
[02:41:40.220 --> 02:41:41.540]   that illustrate that.
[02:41:41.540 --> 02:41:43.420]   John Donaher, from what I can see,
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:44.860]   does a lot of that as well.
[02:41:44.860 --> 02:41:47.620]   I think they're like soulmates in the jujitsu world.
[02:41:47.620 --> 02:41:49.060]   - Yeah.
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:51.060]   And then there's that element that you spoke to,
[02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:55.500]   which is maybe considering the other side.
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:56.500]   - Well, always.
[02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:58.140]   - Devil's advocate kind of thing.
[02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:00.020]   - Yeah, I mean, straw man, steel man stuff.
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:01.140]   You do a lot of that
[02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:02.660]   and I think all the best interviewers do.
[02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:05.340]   But yeah, I think it's really, really important
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:09.340]   to think about, I have to know the other side's case
[02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:10.740]   much better than my own.
[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:14.140]   I have to know what are their defenses,
[02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:16.200]   what are their strengths.
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:21.200]   I have to map out a strategy that keeps those in mind.
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:24.360]   And that's hard because early in my career,
[02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:30.240]   I would attribute to the other side
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:33.400]   an intelligence and strategy
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:35.200]   that sometimes wasn't applicable.
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:40.200]   Like I've learned, there's the simplest explanation
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:43.720]   is the accurate one, the Occam's razor.
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:48.080]   I think sextants would never attribute to strategy
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:52.200]   that which could be attributed to stupidity or laziness.
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:53.560]   Because I have lots of adversaries
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:55.880]   that like they'll not file a motion
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:57.200]   I thought they were gonna file.
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:59.160]   And I'll go, wait, why didn't they file that?
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:01.360]   Like tactically, what are they thinking I'm gonna do?
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:03.480]   And what is that about?
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:04.960]   And I would go, well, if I didn't file it,
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:05.800]   why wouldn't I file?
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:07.980]   And the answer is like, they just didn't think to file it
[02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:09.800]   or like they were too lazy to draft it
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:11.240]   or they went on vacation last week.
[02:43:11.240 --> 02:43:12.080]   So that's why they didn't.
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:15.520]   And I'm driving myself crazy going,
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:17.880]   there's some tactical reason, there must be.
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:21.920]   So I think you have to look honestly
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:26.600]   and don't attribute to the other side, your constitution.
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:29.660]   If I said that, I'd be saying it sarcastically.
[02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:32.240]   If you said it, maybe you weren't saying it sarcastically.
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:33.760]   Like you have to think about the fact
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:35.560]   that we're unique human beings
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:38.360]   who express themselves differently.
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:40.560]   - And for you, the audience is usually the judge?
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:41.680]   Do you do jury? - Yeah, it's the judge.
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:42.960]   No, we don't do jury trials.
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:44.820]   That's the interesting thing about family law attorneys.
[02:43:44.820 --> 02:43:46.320]   Family law attorneys don't do jury trials.
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:47.500]   We do bench trials.
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:49.440]   We just persuade there's a person in a black robe.
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:51.360]   That's the only person I have to convince.
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:52.560]   - Does the person in the black robe,
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:53.960]   do they have emotions?
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:54.800]   Are they human?
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:56.120]   Are they very-- - They are human.
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:57.680]   They are all too human.
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:43:59.160]   - Do they impose that humanity on you?
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:00.520]   Like, do you feel it?
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:01.880]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:04.280]   Oh no, they, do you feel it?
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:06.400]   Like, they're human.
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:07.960]   They're working their shit out.
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:11.200]   They're parents.
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:13.940]   They're husbands and wives.
[02:44:13.940 --> 02:44:18.080]   And you're talking about stuff they deal with.
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:22.820]   I had a woman on the stand, an expert witness on the stand,
[02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:29.080]   who was talking about the emotional and physical abuse
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:32.440]   that was perpetrated on a seven-year-old.
[02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:37.280]   And this person had written a bunch of reports
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:38.840]   that were in evidence in this trial,
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:41.000]   were on like day six or seven of the trial.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:44.840]   And there's all of this information in the record
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:47.920]   about this verbal abuse and mental abuse
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:50.720]   and like gaslighting and like really intense stuff
[02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:53.260]   that this woman was doing to this seven-year-old.
[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:55.240]   And the judge was like vaguely paying attention
[02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:56.300]   for most of the time.
[02:44:56.300 --> 02:44:59.880]   And at some point, the person says,
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:02.160]   "Well, when a parent is abusing a child,"
[02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:03.080]   and the judge just interrupts.
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:04.480]   She goes, "Well, look, you know,
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:06.620]   "do you think like if a person spanks a child,
[02:45:06.620 --> 02:45:07.820]   "that that's abuse?"
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:12.080]   She's like, "Well, like a person in general?"
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:14.680]   Like, and by the way, if my adversary asked that question,
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:16.320]   I could object, but I can't object
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:18.320]   when the judge asks a question.
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:20.440]   They get to rule on that objection.
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:22.600]   So I'm like, "Where's this going?"
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:23.580]   She's like, "Well, no, I mean,
[02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:25.520]   "spanking can be a form of abuse."
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:26.820]   She's like, "Right, but like, you know,
[02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:28.440]   "are you saying like everybody who spanks child?"
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:29.280]   And I'm sitting here going,
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:30.680]   "What is going on in your house?"
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:31.520]   Yeah.
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:33.040]   And she's like, "What went on with your parents?
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:36.380]   "Like, 'cause you're bringing some stuff here
[02:45:36.380 --> 02:45:39.080]   "that's not, this is not what you're supposed to be.
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:41.280]   "This is not your role, you know?"
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:43.280]   But there are good judges and bad judges.
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:46.600]   And that's a big, big deal.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:50.080]   - Well, I've noticed that, now, I don't have kids,
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:53.360]   so I have a certain perspective on the world.
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:55.840]   I really wanna have a family and have kids.
[02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:58.820]   But I've noticed when I talk to people that have kids,
[02:45:58.820 --> 02:46:03.200]   and gender matters also, like fathers are,
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:06.380]   like with daughters and so on,
[02:46:06.380 --> 02:46:11.040]   like it changes the landscape of the conversation.
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:12.380]   - Sure does.
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:15.440]   - It's like, you're no longer this intellectual
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:18.120]   that's like, "Well, there's this and there's this."
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:22.200]   It's more like, like go fuck yourself.
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:27.200]   Anything that fucks with kids can like burn it to the ground.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:33.040]   I don't care what the nuance is
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:34.440]   of the little intellectual thing.
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:36.560]   - Oh, you wanna learn about this.
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:40.360]   Represent someone who's accused of child sexual abuse.
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:42.940]   I've had about a dozen of those cases
[02:46:42.940 --> 02:46:45.100]   where I've represented someone who's alleged
[02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:47.380]   to have perpetrated sexual abuse of a child.
[02:46:47.380 --> 02:46:50.180]   You are guilty until proven innocent.
[02:46:50.180 --> 02:46:52.700]   And let me tell you, as a lawyer,
[02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:55.880]   that is the toughest cases,
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:58.600]   because you put sex and kids together
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:03.180]   and everyone loses their goddamn mind immediately.
[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:04.840]   There's a rush to judgment.
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:08.140]   There is a disregard for procedure.
[02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:10.260]   There is a confirmation bias.
[02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:12.180]   There's a desire to be a protector.
[02:47:12.180 --> 02:47:15.020]   And again, all motivated and informed
[02:47:15.020 --> 02:47:18.660]   by really good things, the desire to protect the innocent,
[02:47:18.660 --> 02:47:21.020]   the desire to protect the vulnerable.
[02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:23.500]   But gang, no.
[02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:26.340]   Like we have these, I like living in a world
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:28.500]   that has due process.
[02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:29.860]   I like these rules.
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:32.020]   I like the rules of evidence.
[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:34.180]   I like innocent until proven guilty.
[02:47:34.180 --> 02:47:35.920]   I like that.
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:37.620]   I'm not saying it's perfect.
[02:47:37.620 --> 02:47:39.940]   - It's such a, I'm so torn on it,
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:42.580]   because I also like living in a world
[02:47:42.580 --> 02:47:46.300]   where people are so emotionally invested
[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:51.140]   in connection to other like humans.
[02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:52.820]   - Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.
[02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:54.220]   They shouldn't be.
[02:47:54.220 --> 02:47:58.220]   - I know, but if you dedicate yourself fully to the law,
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:47:59.900]   you might lose some of the humanity.
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:00.740]   - I don't think you have to.
[02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:03.660]   I have to tell you, I once actually went off
[02:48:03.660 --> 02:48:07.140]   on a DA, on a district attorney,
[02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:12.140]   who was very vehemently prosecuting a child sex abuse case
[02:48:12.140 --> 02:48:14.620]   that I was involved in.
[02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:18.500]   And I remember, I came in,
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:21.220]   thankfully I came in very early in the case.
[02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:24.860]   So the accusation was made and I came in right away.
[02:48:24.860 --> 02:48:26.100]   'Cause very often you get this case,
[02:48:26.100 --> 02:48:27.700]   there've been 15 interviews,
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:29.500]   this person's been interviewed by police,
[02:48:29.500 --> 02:48:31.300]   by Child Protective Services,
[02:48:31.300 --> 02:48:34.740]   and it's like they're already so far down a hole
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:37.620]   they didn't even know they dug themselves into, you know?
[02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:41.380]   So I got in very early on and I just kept saying,
[02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:42.220]   she's like, "Well, we're gonna do this,
[02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:43.060]   "we're gonna do this."
[02:48:43.060 --> 02:48:44.780]   I was like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't,
[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:49.500]   "we should both want this to be fair, done properly."
[02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:54.100]   Like there's an expert, a well-respected expert
[02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:55.620]   who's a clinical psychologist
[02:48:55.620 --> 02:48:57.740]   who their job is they're a validation expert.
[02:48:57.740 --> 02:48:59.740]   So their job is to interview a child.
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:03.380]   They record the interviews with a hidden camera
[02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:04.780]   so that everyone can see they didn't have
[02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:05.860]   suggestive questioning,
[02:49:05.860 --> 02:49:09.740]   there are very stringent standards that they follow
[02:49:09.740 --> 02:49:11.700]   to prevent like suggestive questioning
[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:12.900]   or any of those kinds of things.
[02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:15.500]   And I was saying, "Listen, no,
[02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:17.660]   "no one should be interviewing this child
[02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:19.540]   "other than this person,
[02:49:19.540 --> 02:49:21.940]   "who's a neutral, qualified person."
[02:49:21.940 --> 02:49:23.380]   And I kept saying to the other side,
[02:49:23.380 --> 02:49:24.820]   like, "Wait, no, no, you're,
[02:49:24.820 --> 02:49:27.120]   "see, this is the problem, like you wanna win.
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:28.260]   "You're a lawyer, you wanna win.
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:30.920]   "I wanna win too, right?
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:33.020]   "But we wanna win fair."
[02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:34.140]   Like that's like saying,
[02:49:34.140 --> 02:49:35.940]   "I'm going into a boxing match, I wanna win.
[02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:37.740]   "So if the referee's looking to the side,
[02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:39.180]   "I'm gonna kick the guy in the nuts."
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:40.740]   Like, okay, then you might've won,
[02:49:40.740 --> 02:49:42.620]   but you didn't win boxing.
[02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:44.000]   You won some other thing.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.260]   Like I wanna win a fair fight.
[02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:51.600]   Like I want to go in with the rules set,
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:53.260]   the law, the rules of evidence.
[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:55.940]   I don't want a judge who doesn't understand evidence.
[02:49:55.940 --> 02:49:57.260]   I don't want an adversary
[02:49:57.260 --> 02:49:58.660]   who plays it fast and loose with the rules.
[02:49:58.660 --> 02:50:00.960]   I wanna go in and win a fair fight.
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:02.960]   And that's where when it comes,
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:06.240]   our passion to protect the innocent,
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:08.300]   to emotionally connect,
[02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:12.140]   to feel deeply about children and protecting them,
[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:14.680]   I don't think that that's antagonistic to,
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:16.160]   like we always treat dandruff
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:17.980]   with decapitation in this culture,
[02:50:17.980 --> 02:50:19.960]   and I don't understand it.
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:21.320]   And that's what I like about the law.
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:23.800]   The law, there's rules,
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:26.440]   and there's rules about procedure.
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:27.980]   And so that's our job,
[02:50:27.980 --> 02:50:29.360]   is to bring out the truth
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:31.000]   using the rules and the procedure.
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.200]   And I love that job.
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:36.800]   - But still there's a human being in the judge, right?
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:37.920]   - That's the problem.
[02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:39.880]   - It seems like a really hard job.
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:40.700]   - It's a real area.
[02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:42.800]   - 'Cause you have to pay attention to the whole thing.
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:44.160]   - You have to pay attention to the whole thing,
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:47.800]   and everyone is trying to persuade you and lie to you.
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:48.640]   - Yeah.
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:52.320]   - And everyone can keep their shit together
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:54.600]   in a court appearance most of the time.
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:55.980]   Like it takes a rare kind of crazy
[02:50:55.980 --> 02:50:57.160]   to blow up in a courtroom.
[02:50:57.160 --> 02:50:58.000]   So most of the time,
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:50:59.320]   everybody looks really put together,
[02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:01.760]   and like, yeah, you gotta have an amazing bullshit detector.
[02:51:01.760 --> 02:51:03.320]   I'm not saying they don't have a really hard job.
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:04.600]   They have a really hard job.
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:06.280]   They have a way harder job than I have.
[02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:09.120]   - What's their source of ground truth?
[02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:12.720]   Like how do they sharpen the radar for bullshit?
[02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:15.440]   - I think that they're assessing credibility,
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:17.320]   which is what you call it in the law,
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:19.280]   is something that, you know,
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:22.000]   I think you're supposed to develop it on the job.
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:25.680]   - Do you have the data of who was lying in the end or not?
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:27.040]   - No, not really.
[02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:27.880]   Not really.
[02:51:27.880 --> 02:51:30.240]   I can try to demonstrate a lot.
[02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:31.400]   What I always tell clients,
[02:51:31.400 --> 02:51:33.680]   and this is the art of advocacy, right,
[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:38.680]   is I want to use examples of misrepresentations
[02:51:38.680 --> 02:51:43.320]   to show that this person's a liar.
[02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:48.200]   Like I'm trying to extrapolate from the small, the large.
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:51.480]   Like I'm trying to say, here's three times he lied,
[02:51:51.480 --> 02:51:53.920]   therefore he's a liar.
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:54.800]   When in fact, you know,
[02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:57.360]   we know human beings don't really work that way.
[02:51:57.360 --> 02:51:59.960]   But I've seen people submarine,
[02:51:59.960 --> 02:52:03.200]   they're just torpedo their entire case
[02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:05.960]   because they lied about some dumb shit,
[02:52:05.960 --> 02:52:07.880]   some dumb little thing.
[02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:10.840]   And I say to them, why would you lie?
[02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:12.520]   Why did you lie about that?
[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:15.600]   Like I had a case where a person was accused
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:17.600]   of child sexual abuse.
[02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:19.520]   And on cross-examination, they were asked,
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:21.760]   did you have an affair with this babysitter?
[02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:24.520]   And they were like, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:26.840]   And then it was shown through text messages and things.
[02:52:26.840 --> 02:52:29.320]   They clearly had an affair with the babysitter.
[02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:31.640]   And I said, why did you lie?
[02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:33.160]   And they said, well, I didn't want that to come out.
[02:52:33.160 --> 02:52:36.000]   I said, right, but now you're a liar.
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:39.000]   Like, did you molest your child?
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:42.000]   'Cause if the answer to that is no,
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.320]   and now you destroyed your credibility
[02:52:44.320 --> 02:52:45.880]   'cause you didn't want to admit
[02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:48.160]   that you slept with an adult woman.
[02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:50.640]   By the way, it would have been good for your case.
[02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:52.160]   Would have been good for your case for you to say,
[02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:53.000]   yeah, I slept with her
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.280]   'cause I like sleeping with adult women.
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:56.120]   That's how I am.
[02:52:56.120 --> 02:52:58.440]   I don't sleep with children, much less my own.
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:02.720]   So why would you lie?
[02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:06.600]   And so that concept is incredibly important.
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:08.120]   And judges, theoretically,
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:10.160]   they have to make very tough calls.
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:13.160]   I feel like it's the most impotent place
[02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:15.840]   to just sit there and dispassionately sort of listen
[02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:17.040]   and rule on objections.
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:19.640]   Like, I just would be so frustrated
[02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:21.280]   'cause I'd want to get up and,
[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:23.400]   you know, I had to do jury duty once.
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:26.600]   And it was like a horrific experience for me
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:27.440]   because I'm sitting there and I'm-
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:28.280]   You have no power.
[02:53:28.280 --> 02:53:29.400]   You're just a taker. Yeah, I'm just watching
[02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:30.240]   these two lawyers.
[02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:31.240]   I'm like, why did you ask that question that way?
[02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:32.400]   I would never have asked it that way.
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:33.840]   Why would you object?
[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:35.360]   When you object, you bring more attention to it.
[02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:36.240]   What are you doing?
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.400]   Like, I'm watching both of them.
[02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:39.400]   It's like watching like a jujitsu,
[02:53:39.400 --> 02:53:41.040]   but probably what it'd feel like
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:44.080]   for like John Donahue to watch two white belts spar.
[02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:46.560]   Like, why are you doing, wow, my God, what are you doing?
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:47.560]   Why would you grab that?
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:48.880]   What are you thinking?
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:51.360]   Like, and, you know, it's frustrating.
[02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:52.520]   It's frustrating to watch.
[02:53:52.520 --> 02:53:55.400]   And as a judge, it must just be unbelievable.
[02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:59.640]   So divorce lawyers sometimes get a bad rap.
[02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:01.240]   Is there a reason for this?
[02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:06.600]   I mean, no one's ever happy to be spending time
[02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:08.320]   with a divorce lawyer.
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:09.720]   Like if you have a criminal lawyer,
[02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:12.400]   they're defending you against the maelstrom of injustice
[02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:13.680]   and false allegations.
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:16.080]   They're protecting your freedom.
[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:18.120]   And maybe you're acquitted and then you're like,
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:20.360]   oh, that person saved me, you know?
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:22.040]   You buy a house, you know,
[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:23.760]   that lawyer helps you get the house.
[02:54:23.760 --> 02:54:24.840]   You know, you're happy about that.
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:25.680]   Sign the paperwork.
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:28.000]   You do a will, like you help them make you feel secure.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:32.640]   Like at best, I'm a representative of a chapter
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:35.080]   in someone's life that was very unpleasant.
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:38.200]   I have a friend who's a Juilliard-trained classical pianist
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:41.640]   and he was having a humidification system
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:43.440]   installed in his home
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:47.040]   because his piano required a certain level of humidity.
[02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:48.320]   And it was very expensive
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:50.920]   to install this humidification system.
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:53.880]   And we went out to dinner and then we came back to his place
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:58.040]   and he said, man, this is the most depressing $15,000
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:54:59.040]   I've ever spent.
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:54:59.880]   And I said, why?
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:02.720]   And he said, 'cause there's nothing different.
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:03.960]   Like I spent $15,000
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:06.200]   and I feel absolutely nothing different.
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:08.160]   My piano does, but I don't.
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:09.760]   Like I don't have anything to show for it.
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:12.000]   Like you finish getting divorced,
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:13.880]   you don't really have anything to show for it.
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:14.720]   Yeah.
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:15.640]   At best.
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:16.480]   Yeah.
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:17.320]   At best, it's the same.
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:18.680]   'Cause one of the things I think that's interesting
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:22.380]   about divorce is in our increasingly performative society,
[02:55:22.380 --> 02:55:25.840]   you can't pretend you meant to get divorced.
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:27.080]   You can't.
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:28.360]   Like everything everybody does.
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:29.680]   Like, well, I wrote that album for me.
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:31.600]   It didn't matter that it was not gonna be popular.
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:33.520]   No, you wanted that album to be popular.
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:34.440]   Like, come on.
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:35.280]   Like you're lying.
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:36.600]   And that's fine, but you're lying.
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:38.480]   Oh, I think my haircut came out great.
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:39.880]   I wanted it to look this fucked up.
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:40.720]   No, you didn't.
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:41.760]   You didn't, you're lying.
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:44.060]   And that's fine because we live in a society now
[02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:46.040]   where everybody's just, oh yes, I meant to do that.
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:48.440]   Okay, divorce, nope.
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:49.960]   You got married.
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:52.480]   You wouldn't, you break up in a relationship,
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:53.320]   not a marriage.
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:54.600]   Okay, well, we were only gonna be together
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:55.440]   for a little while.
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:56.260]   It was never serious.
[02:55:56.260 --> 02:55:57.680]   We were just like, you know, we were having fun.
[02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:58.520]   That's all it was.
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:00.720]   It wasn't, we were never gonna be happily ever after.
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:01.960]   No, you got married.
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:03.720]   You got married, guys.
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:06.000]   You got up there and you said forever.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:09.640]   And it didn't go forever.
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:12.720]   So you can't bullshit anybody anymore.
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:14.360]   Like you, no, it didn't go the way
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:15.200]   you thought it was gonna go.
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:16.800]   It didn't go the way you signed on for.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:20.720]   So now that that's undeniable,
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:22.680]   like what can we make it?
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:23.680]   What can we make it into?
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:24.520]   Like it can be beautiful.
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:25.360]   You know, the barn's burned down.
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:26.660]   Now I can see the moon.
[02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:28.520]   You know, like let's make it something.
[02:56:28.520 --> 02:56:31.840]   And so for me, I think people look at a divorce lawyer
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:36.160]   and they just go, yeah, like this is this horrible chapter
[02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:37.640]   and I associate you with it.
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:40.940]   Also too, listen, some of the things we do,
[02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:44.200]   it's difficult to simultaneously prevent
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:45.480]   and prepare for war.
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:50.500]   The things you do to protect your client sometimes
[02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:52.460]   look like acts of aggression,
[02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:57.320]   but really they're just trying to shore up a defense.
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:59.160]   And so I get paid to be paranoid
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:00.840]   and I have to say to clients sometimes like,
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:03.040]   well, are you sure that they're not doing this?
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:04.200]   And then they go, well, I don't know.
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:05.560]   And I go, well, let me inquire.
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:06.680]   Did she accuse me of that?
[02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:08.200]   No, no, I'm not accusing you.
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:12.080]   I'm just trying, like we get a reputation, divorce lawyers,
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:14.760]   as amping up a conflict 'cause we get paid
[02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:16.520]   for the conflict, right?
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:18.520]   So like if you get paid by the bullet,
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:22.680]   you're gonna start a lot of gunfights, right?
[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:24.400]   It doesn't really work that way
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:26.680]   with most good divorce lawyers.
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:30.000]   Like there are plenty of people that are bad lawyers
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:33.180]   and they stoke up conflict because it jacks up fees.
[02:57:33.180 --> 02:57:34.960]   They usually don't do well.
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:36.760]   They don't build a successful career
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:38.400]   'cause you live and die by your reputation.
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:40.040]   Yes, reputation is everything.
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:44.800]   But good lawyers, like good experienced divorce lawyers,
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:49.240]   we do the whole, you know, hey, listen,
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:50.600]   you're gonna say this, I'm gonna say this.
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:52.360]   You're gonna do this, I'm gonna do this.
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:53.360]   Let's skip it.
[02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:54.400]   We're gonna end up here.
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:55.760]   You know, we got Judge Blavov Law
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:56.760]   and you know what he's gonna do.
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:57.640]   He's gonna go right here.
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:57:59.640]   So why don't we just agree right now to X, Y, Z?
[02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:01.120]   Sounds good, we're done, we're good.
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:03.240]   - So you wanna minimize the number of bullets.
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:05.560]   - It's like the two, it's like a "Moyamada Mishashi."
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:08.480]   You know, it's like the two swordsmen who see each other
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:10.280]   and they just stand there at the edge
[02:58:10.280 --> 02:58:12.380]   and they see the whole fight in their minds
[02:58:12.380 --> 02:58:14.840]   and they know who won and who lost and they walk away.
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:16.480]   Like we do a lot of that.
[02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:18.280]   We do a lot of, okay.
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:22.040]   You know, it's like when you watch high-level chess
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:24.880]   and someone resigns and you go, wait, what happened?
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:28.000]   He didn't win and you go, no, no, the other guy won.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:31.280]   It's 15 moves from now, but he won
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:32.760]   and the other guy sees it.
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:34.160]   So now we're done.
[02:58:34.160 --> 02:58:38.680]   - Can you speak to some recent high-profile divorces?
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:42.760]   Like the most recent I saw is Kevin Costner.
[02:58:42.760 --> 02:58:44.400]   - Yeah, Kevin Costner's a great,
[02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:46.080]   I mean, I don't know him, I'm not involved in the case.
[02:58:46.080 --> 02:58:47.680]   - By the way, "Yellowstone" is just so great.
[02:58:47.680 --> 02:58:48.520]   - Oh, it's so good, right?
[02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:51.200]   - And I hope Matthew McConaughey, who I've gotten to know,
[02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:54.840]   I hope he does one of these shows.
[02:58:54.840 --> 02:58:55.960]   It's "Yellowstone" or anything else.
[02:58:55.960 --> 02:58:58.680]   He's just born for the role, frankly, but anyway.
[02:58:58.680 --> 02:58:59.800]   - He'd be amazing in that.
[02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:01.760]   Yeah, your conversation with him was great.
[02:59:01.760 --> 02:59:03.680]   The Kevin Costner divorce is interesting
[02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:07.680]   because Kevin Costner had one of the most expensive,
[02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:10.240]   from a distributive award perspective,
[02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:13.440]   like he gave a huge payout to his first wife.
[02:59:13.440 --> 02:59:17.240]   And then this time he had a prenup.
[02:59:17.240 --> 02:59:20.520]   So it's actually, it's a very public showing
[02:59:20.520 --> 02:59:22.740]   of the fact that one's bitten twice shy.
[02:59:22.740 --> 02:59:25.060]   Like he had a very public divorce
[02:59:25.060 --> 02:59:27.900]   that cost him a lot of assets
[02:59:27.900 --> 02:59:30.000]   in terms of the division of assets.
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.960]   And now it appears by all acknowledged reports
[02:59:32.960 --> 02:59:34.680]   that he had a prenuptial agreement
[02:59:34.680 --> 02:59:37.480]   that was well-crafted and enforceable.
[02:59:37.480 --> 02:59:42.480]   And the argument now is over what is child support,
[02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:45.300]   what is spousal support,
[02:59:45.300 --> 02:59:47.200]   what's covered in the prenup and what isn't.
[02:59:47.200 --> 02:59:49.040]   - So it seems like the prenup worked, actually.
[02:59:49.040 --> 02:59:49.880]   - The prenup worked.
[02:59:49.880 --> 02:59:51.600]   You know, in Kevin Costner's career,
[02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:53.900]   which has always been a steady career,
[02:59:53.900 --> 02:59:59.880]   I don't know that in the Hollywood stock market
[02:59:59.880 --> 03:00:02.000]   that people would have bet on "Yellowstone."
[03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:03.560]   Like I think you would have said,
[03:00:03.560 --> 03:00:06.400]   "Hey, the best years of that guy's career were behind him."
[03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:07.540]   You know, how do you get better
[03:00:07.540 --> 03:00:10.160]   than dances with wolves and Robin Hood
[03:00:10.160 --> 03:00:13.680]   and like all these big, big, the bodyguard.
[03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:15.080]   And then "Yellowstone."
[03:00:15.080 --> 03:00:17.520]   And it's like, holy cow, did he knock that out of the park?
[03:00:17.520 --> 03:00:18.920]   And he's central to it.
[03:00:18.920 --> 03:00:20.600]   I mean, he knocked the skin off the ball.
[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:24.080]   So I think that's why prenups are important.
[03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:25.600]   You don't know what your career is gonna do.
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:26.800]   You don't know where it's gonna go.
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:29.440]   And so he saved himself a lot of money.
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:31.560]   He also has a great lawyer.
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:32.440]   He has Laura Wasser.
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:35.280]   Laura Wasser is, you know, LA, you know,
[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:38.040]   just a top professional, brilliant lawyer,
[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:41.940]   even-tempered but intense in the courtroom
[03:00:41.940 --> 03:00:44.160]   and just a smart, smart human being.
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:46.520]   - The thing I liked just, you know,
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:48.040]   I haven't been following it,
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:50.280]   but I saw a few comments he's made
[03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:54.040]   and he like refused to comment negatively
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:56.200]   about his spouse and just smart.
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:01.200]   But like the way he said it, it wasn't lawyer advice.
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:03.680]   It's good lawyer advice probably.
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:04.720]   But he said it from the heart,
[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:07.240]   which I always like, I like seeing that.
[03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:08.080]   - Yeah.
[03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:11.240]   - Like where he refuses even the drama,
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:15.280]   even the public nature of it to like throwing jabs or.
[03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:17.960]   - Well, Laura, his lawyer is actually notorious
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:20.920]   for like not speaking to the press about cases
[03:01:20.920 --> 03:01:22.520]   in an extended way.
[03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:23.680]   And that's smart move.
[03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:25.260]   Like I don't speak about pending cases
[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:27.520]   I'm involved in publicly.
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:29.480]   And I discourage my clients from doing so.
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:31.100]   I can't always stop them.
[03:01:31.100 --> 03:01:33.520]   But I discourage them from doing so.
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:35.560]   I don't think there's any good to come of it.
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:37.560]   There are lawyers who try to try things
[03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:39.120]   in the court of public opinion.
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:42.920]   I think there is a,
[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:44.960]   to take it to the broader principle you just brought up.
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:47.160]   I think there is a lot of value
[03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:50.560]   in talking about your ex in a favorable way.
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:55.520]   I have to say, when I first got divorced many years ago,
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:57.560]   I went on a date with a young woman.
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:00.680]   It's one of my first dates as a divorced man.
[03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:02.900]   And she was a divorced woman.
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:04.920]   And she's a beautiful woman.
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:07.520]   And we were having dinner and it was going quite well.
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:08.600]   And it was one of those things where I was like,
[03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:11.200]   oh, I definitely wanna see this girl again.
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:12.040]   And I said something about,
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:14.240]   oh, there's gonna be this thing at this museum,
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:15.080]   we should go.
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:16.160]   And she's like, oh yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:17.560]   And I'm like, yeah, we should definitely,
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:19.880]   maybe that will be the next thing we do together.
[03:02:19.880 --> 03:02:21.280]   And she was like, yeah, we should go next weekend.
[03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:23.280]   Like the kids are with the asshole, so we can go.
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:25.540]   And I just, it was like,
[03:02:25.540 --> 03:02:26.880]   you could hear that record scratch.
[03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:27.720]   Like, (imitates record scratching)
[03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:30.760]   And I just went, oh yeah, no, this isn't good.
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:32.920]   Like, I'm not, you're referring to the father of your kids
[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:34.540]   as the asshole?
[03:02:34.540 --> 03:02:37.240]   Like, we're already, I'm walking into something here
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:38.880]   that I don't know that I wanna be involved in.
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:41.920]   Matthew McConaughey, before he was married,
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:44.640]   if you look at his history,
[03:02:44.640 --> 03:02:49.640]   he dated some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood
[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:51.140]   in their prime.
[03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:57.840]   And none of them ever talked bad about him in the press.
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:03:01.400]   They all were like, oh my God, he's such a great guy,
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:02.240]   such a great guy.
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:04.840]   And I always wondered, like, how do you,
[03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:07.680]   he got out of all of those relationships
[03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:09.800]   without a scratch on him.
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:12.280]   And when you'd watch an interview with him,
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:17.000]   they would say like, so you dated Penelope Cruz.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:22.000]   And he'd go, Penelope, that's just a special lady.
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:24.720]   She's just a, what a special lady.
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:27.520]   She's just a wonderful, what a wonderful woman.
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:29.820]   I'm just so blessed to have the time with her.
[03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:31.680]   What a beautiful, wonderful woman.
[03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:34.720]   And I would think to myself, I'm like, you're a genius.
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:36.120]   Like, he's a genius.
[03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:41.120]   Because like, he'd never came off as petty, spiteful, bitter,
[03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:42.200]   any of that.
[03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:45.360]   He just came off as like, just dignified, strong,
[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:47.160]   smart, self-assured.
[03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:50.240]   And like, it left, you know, it left like,
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:54.400]   it left the viewer with the impression that like,
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:55.240]   when he was looking off in space,
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:57.000]   he's probably like, just thinking about
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.400]   some wonderful time he had with her.
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:01.320]   And you think to yourself, like, God, that guy,
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:04.440]   like, he just became cooler and cooler.
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:07.440]   Whereas if he got into like, the whole, you know,
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:08.560]   oh yeah, that was ugly.
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:09.800]   And then, you know, this happened.
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:11.240]   And like, nobody wants to hear it.
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:12.080]   It's awful.
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:13.800]   - The funny thing about him just having interacted
[03:04:13.800 --> 03:04:15.320]   with him a bunch, I don't think,
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:19.360]   he's in the Rogan school of thought, I think,
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:22.040]   that I don't see him ever having a fight.
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:26.000]   Now, his parents were, as he's spoken about a bunch,
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:27.120]   nonstop fighting.
[03:04:27.120 --> 03:04:30.640]   They got divorced and remarried and just insane.
[03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:31.640]   - And they were volatile.
[03:04:31.640 --> 03:04:32.480]   - Yeah, very.
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:35.440]   And he seems, maybe you kind of,
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:36.840]   it's a pendulum swinging the other way.
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:39.680]   He just seems cool as a cucumber, like, always.
[03:04:39.680 --> 03:04:41.840]   - Just lets it roll off.
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:46.840]   But you know, even if it's internally not rolling off,
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:52.720]   there is value in just rising above it in your discourse.
[03:04:52.720 --> 03:04:55.720]   - That's true, yes.
[03:04:55.720 --> 03:04:58.880]   - Like, you lie to your children.
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:00.520]   Like, people say this to me all the time, clients.
[03:05:00.520 --> 03:05:03.640]   They're like, you know, why did you tell your child
[03:05:03.640 --> 03:05:05.040]   that dad had an affair?
[03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:07.240]   Well, I'm not gonna lie to my kids.
[03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:08.160]   Fuck you.
[03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:09.000]   Yes, you are.
[03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.160]   You lie to your kids all the time.
[03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:12.560]   Mommy, are you gonna die someday?
[03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:14.840]   Yes, babe, I'm gonna die and daddy's gonna die.
[03:05:14.840 --> 03:05:16.640]   And then someday the earth's gonna hurl into the sun
[03:05:16.640 --> 03:05:17.800]   and we're all gonna die.
[03:05:17.800 --> 03:05:18.640]   Sweet dreams.
[03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:21.240]   Like, that's not, you lie to your kids all the time.
[03:05:21.240 --> 03:05:22.600]   You know, what's wrong with me?
[03:05:22.600 --> 03:05:23.720]   We don't know what's wrong with you.
[03:05:23.720 --> 03:05:24.600]   We're gonna take you to the doctor
[03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:26.720]   and hopefully it's nothing serious and you won't die.
[03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:28.360]   Like, you lie to your kids all the time.
[03:05:28.360 --> 03:05:30.240]   You tell them that Santa Claus exists when he does,
[03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:31.680]   whatever.
[03:05:31.680 --> 03:05:34.400]   So to say, I'm not gonna lie to my kids.
[03:05:34.400 --> 03:05:35.880]   Like, you lie to your kids all the time.
[03:05:35.880 --> 03:05:38.360]   You don't like your husband, that's okay.
[03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:40.920]   You don't like your ex-husband, but it's their father.
[03:05:40.920 --> 03:05:42.800]   So just grin, you know.
[03:05:42.800 --> 03:05:44.760]   Oh, daddy took me to meet his new girlfriend, Kiki.
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:45.600]   Oh, that's nice.
[03:05:45.600 --> 03:05:46.440]   Did you guys have a good time?
[03:05:46.440 --> 03:05:47.280]   You did, oh, that's, yeah.
[03:05:47.280 --> 03:05:49.280]   And she helped me do my hair and she did my makeup.
[03:05:49.280 --> 03:05:52.560]   Listen, I'm sure that's burning you inside.
[03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:54.360]   But you go, oh, that's great.
[03:05:54.360 --> 03:05:55.200]   'Cause why?
[03:05:55.200 --> 03:05:56.080]   You love your kids.
[03:05:56.080 --> 03:05:57.880]   - Well, that's what, I mean, again,
[03:05:57.880 --> 03:06:00.520]   Makani has a way bottom with that.
[03:06:00.520 --> 03:06:02.880]   He's like, he basically says never lie,
[03:06:02.880 --> 03:06:04.800]   but a little bullshit is okay.
[03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:07.080]   - Sure, sure, yeah.
[03:06:07.080 --> 03:06:11.200]   - I mean, I'm very, Tom Waits has that song, "Lie to Me."
[03:06:11.200 --> 03:06:13.440]   You gotta lie to me, baby.
[03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:15.920]   You know, honesty is a funny thing.
[03:06:15.920 --> 03:06:18.560]   - But Tom Waits also believes that God's a way on business.
[03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:20.640]   - I think his words, man.
[03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:23.400]   - And who are the ones that we left in charge?
[03:06:23.400 --> 03:06:25.680]   Killers, thieves, and lawyers.
[03:06:25.680 --> 03:06:27.000]   That's a Tom Waits quote.
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:28.480]   - Well, it must be true then.
[03:06:28.480 --> 03:06:32.280]   I don't know how many limbs I have,
[03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:35.320]   but I will give all of them to talk to Tom.
[03:06:35.320 --> 03:06:38.080]   And he's a very private person.
[03:06:38.080 --> 03:06:39.400]   - I feel like he's the musical equivalent
[03:06:39.400 --> 03:06:40.800]   of Cormac McCarthy.
[03:06:40.800 --> 03:06:41.640]   - Yeah.
[03:06:41.640 --> 03:06:43.480]   - Even if you get the interview, you're not,
[03:06:43.480 --> 03:06:45.040]   I don't think, gonna get in there.
[03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:46.560]   - No, I don't think you want,
[03:06:46.560 --> 03:06:48.000]   honestly, I don't think you want to.
[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:52.160]   I think, I've seen his public interviews over the years
[03:06:52.160 --> 03:06:57.160]   with Letterman, and I think he just, he is the poetry.
[03:06:57.160 --> 03:07:02.880]   - I would put Tom Waits, Cormac McCarthy,
[03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:08.080]   Maynard James Keenan, like these are artists that like,
[03:07:08.080 --> 03:07:12.760]   I think they want the art to speak for itself.
[03:07:12.760 --> 03:07:17.320]   They would like to be less in, they don't want you to,
[03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:20.160]   and I remember early, early days of Tool,
[03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:25.120]   that he, like this, he could not have been less interested
[03:07:25.120 --> 03:07:26.920]   in the spotlight.
[03:07:26.920 --> 03:07:29.840]   To the point where I think it was almost to the detriment
[03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:32.960]   of the band early on, you know, and that's,
[03:07:32.960 --> 03:07:35.280]   there's no surprise that those are three artists
[03:07:35.280 --> 03:07:38.280]   that I think are unbelievable,
[03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:40.000]   and in a category of their own,
[03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:43.960]   and that you hear their performance.
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:46.840]   Like, you can give me a page of a Cormac McCarthy novel,
[03:07:46.840 --> 03:07:48.680]   and I'll know it's a Cormac McCarthy novel.
[03:07:48.680 --> 03:07:51.640]   You can, a few notes of Maynard James Keenan
[03:07:51.640 --> 03:07:54.520]   or Tom Waits' voice, you know that that's them.
[03:07:54.520 --> 03:07:58.120]   - Yeah, it's genius, genius eyes from the spotlight.
[03:07:58.120 --> 03:07:59.760]   But, you know, it doesn't stop me
[03:07:59.760 --> 03:08:01.600]   from feeling sad about it, but anyway.
[03:08:01.600 --> 03:08:03.520]   - Yeah, that does, I would like to hear that interview.
[03:08:03.520 --> 03:08:04.800]   - She's the girl that got away.
[03:08:04.800 --> 03:08:06.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:08:06.200 --> 03:08:09.080]   - And I'm just standing outside of that girl's house
[03:08:09.080 --> 03:08:10.280]   with a boob box. - You just with a sign,
[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:13.680]   yeah, just playing in your eyes, Peter Gabriel, yeah.
[03:08:13.680 --> 03:08:17.240]   - Yeah, anyway, what does it lie to me?
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:21.080]   This whole idea of honesty in relationships is interesting.
[03:08:21.080 --> 03:08:22.880]   I mean, clerks with the blowjobs.
[03:08:22.880 --> 03:08:23.720]   - Yeah.
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:27.300]   - I don't know how to phrase it eloquently,
[03:08:27.300 --> 03:08:31.760]   but like, there's stuff you should be honest about,
[03:08:31.760 --> 03:08:35.240]   and there's stuff maybe you don't need to be honest about.
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:40.240]   So in the law, it is illegal to commit fraud.
[03:08:40.240 --> 03:08:43.980]   Fraud is a material misrepresentation of fact.
[03:08:43.980 --> 03:08:47.360]   But the law specifically says you're permitted
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:50.220]   to engage in, quote, mere puffery.
[03:08:50.220 --> 03:08:53.000]   - Nice. - Puffery.
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:56.680]   So, and that's the term that was used for it, puffery.
[03:08:56.680 --> 03:09:01.540]   And puffery is when you are inflating something,
[03:09:01.540 --> 03:09:03.560]   you're being like hyperbolic.
[03:09:03.560 --> 03:09:06.600]   But people wouldn't necessarily think
[03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:09.640]   you're telling the truth, you know, like it's not,
[03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:12.360]   you know, like if I say to you, this bottle of water,
[03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:15.760]   you know, was held by Elvis,
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:18.840]   and that's why you should pay me $50 for it, that's fraud.
[03:09:18.840 --> 03:09:21.020]   But if I say this is the water that has been,
[03:09:21.020 --> 03:09:23.560]   this water is drank by the finest people.
[03:09:23.560 --> 03:09:25.800]   Presidents drink this water.
[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:28.320]   Now this is puffery, you know.
[03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:31.720]   And so advertising, marketing is based on puffery.
[03:09:31.720 --> 03:09:32.560]   It's not fraud.
[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:33.880]   It's fraud, it crosses the line.
[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:35.720]   So I think there's a difference
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:38.760]   between honesty and candor, right?
[03:09:38.760 --> 03:09:43.760]   So in relationships, being honest is good.
[03:09:43.760 --> 03:09:48.280]   Being totally candid is probably not a great idea.
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:51.600]   Like it's indelicate to be totally candid.
[03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:54.400]   About some things, if a woman you're
[03:09:54.400 --> 03:09:57.520]   in a romantic relationship with says to you,
[03:09:57.520 --> 03:10:00.280]   do I look good in this dress?
[03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:01.360]   And they don't.
[03:10:02.360 --> 03:10:05.120]   Or do I look fat in this?
[03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:05.960]   That's a better way.
[03:10:05.960 --> 03:10:08.000]   Any heterosexual man who's ever been in a relationship
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:09.360]   has had that question asked of him.
[03:10:09.360 --> 03:10:10.440]   Do I look fat in this?
[03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:11.680]   Does this make my butt look big?
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:14.240]   Or does, whatever, does this, do I look fat in this?
[03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:17.280]   If you go, yes, that's indelicate.
[03:10:17.280 --> 03:10:19.280]   It's honest, but it's indelicate,
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:21.560]   and it's almost mean, right?
[03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:25.240]   But there is, and if you say no, but it's true.
[03:10:25.240 --> 03:10:26.640]   She doesn't look good in that.
[03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:31.600]   The concern she sees is a legitimate concern.
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:36.160]   Do you lie and go, no, no, you look great in that.
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:37.000]   This is great.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.680]   That's not a good thing either.
[03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:40.880]   So what do you say?
[03:10:40.880 --> 03:10:47.440]   That blue dress you have really compliments your body
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:49.360]   in a way that one doesn't.
[03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:52.960]   The cut of that dress is such that it doesn't flatter you.
[03:10:52.960 --> 03:10:54.440]   I see what you're saying.
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:57.800]   Now it's the dress, it's not you, babe.
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:10:59.680]   But I'm telling you the truth.
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:01.240]   I'm addressing your concern.
[03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:05.280]   This is what, this is the distinction.
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:08.160]   Don't material misrepresent the facts.
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:11.240]   Don't steer people down roads that,
[03:11:11.240 --> 03:11:13.800]   you know that that's not how it's gonna go, right?
[03:11:13.800 --> 03:11:16.920]   But so it's like if the woman says, I love you,
[03:11:16.920 --> 03:11:19.280]   and you don't love her, don't say, I love you back.
[03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:23.440]   You do the, oh, I have very strong feelings for you as well.
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:25.600]   There has to be some middle ground.
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:27.400]   You don't just pretend you didn't hear them.
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:30.840]   Yeah, I mean, I guess all of it requires skill
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:31.960]   just like you described.
[03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:36.280]   I think just being honest in quotes is not enough.
[03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:38.800]   Well, it's not a specific enough instruction.
[03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:40.360]   I mean, that's the problem.
[03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:41.920]   When you write a relationship book,
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:43.600]   which I never intended to do,
[03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:47.320]   people come to you and say,
[03:11:47.320 --> 03:11:52.240]   what are the things I should do to help my relationship?
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:53.880]   Or what is the cause of divorce?
[03:11:53.880 --> 03:11:55.200]   And you go, well, disconnection.
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:56.760]   But like, what do you mean by that?
[03:11:56.760 --> 03:11:58.920]   Or like, how do I improve my relationship?
[03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:00.720]   Pay more attention.
[03:12:00.720 --> 03:12:02.640]   Make small gestures.
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:03.800]   Okay, what does that even mean?
[03:12:03.800 --> 03:12:05.040]   Like, what do you mean?
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:07.120]   Like acts of love, you should show your partner
[03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:08.160]   that you love them more often.
[03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:09.000]   What do you mean?
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.520]   Like what I say, what I do, we should have more sex?
[03:12:11.520 --> 03:12:13.080]   Like, what are you saying?
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:16.560]   Like people want measurable, specific things.
[03:12:16.560 --> 03:12:19.440]   So that's why I tried in my book to be like very specific
[03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:22.600]   about like things you can do, things you shouldn't do.
[03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:25.840]   And they're practical suggestions.
[03:12:25.840 --> 03:12:27.760]   Like leaving a note.
[03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:29.680]   I talk a lot about leaving a note.
[03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:32.520]   Like if you're dating someone or you're living with them
[03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:34.000]   or you're in a serious relationship,
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.840]   send a text, leave a note, just little, every day,
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:38.800]   just some little thing that just tells them
[03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:40.280]   how much you like them.
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:43.640]   Like this is a low cost, high value move.
[03:12:43.640 --> 03:12:44.960]   Doesn't take much.
[03:12:44.960 --> 03:12:46.240]   And it's a practical thing.
[03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:49.600]   But we speak in these sort of like broader axioms,
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:52.920]   these broader concepts that people just don't have any idea
[03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:54.600]   how to practically apply.
[03:12:54.600 --> 03:12:56.680]   - I can't wait to listen to the audio book
[03:12:56.680 --> 03:12:59.360]   where you talk about managing marital finances
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:00.680]   is like anal sex.
[03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:06.800]   Your mastery of the metaphor touches one's heart and soul.
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:10.880]   You're Shakespeare of the 21st century, really.
[03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:12.920]   - I don't know that Shakespeare would have brought anal up
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:14.680]   in that context, but I appreciate it.
[03:13:14.680 --> 03:13:16.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:13:16.400 --> 03:13:20.080]   - My thesis there or my point there was,
[03:13:20.080 --> 03:13:24.520]   you'll proceed carefully and have discussion in advance.
[03:13:24.520 --> 03:13:26.880]   And don't just spring it on someone.
[03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:30.120]   And realize that if this goes wrong,
[03:13:30.120 --> 03:13:32.480]   it will go catastrophically wrong.
[03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:36.440]   So good communication is important.
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:39.480]   And yeah, I don't think it's something
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:43.680]   you should just dive into unless you're prepared for that
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:47.560]   to have potentially a very negative impact.
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:50.520]   - And finances is one of the sources
[03:13:50.520 --> 03:13:53.000]   of a huge amount of stress in relationships, which is--
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:53.840]   - Tremendous.
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:57.640]   Because it's about value, I think.
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:02.480]   I mean, it's aside from having painful conversations
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:05.440]   about what you tried to do and were able to do
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:07.040]   or what your impulse control was
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:08.560]   in terms of what you spent money on.
[03:14:08.560 --> 03:14:10.560]   Like there's the conversation
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:13.200]   and then there's what's underneath the conversation.
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:15.280]   There's gender stuff about men feeling
[03:14:15.280 --> 03:14:17.080]   the need to be a provider.
[03:14:17.080 --> 03:14:20.320]   There's gender stuff of men or women
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:22.840]   thinking material goods will fill the void
[03:14:22.840 --> 03:14:26.820]   and buying things and then creating stress on their partner.
[03:14:26.820 --> 03:14:31.320]   There's the very human desire to make things seem effortless
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:33.560]   so your spouse doesn't feel any stress
[03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:36.160]   when in fact it's causing tremendous financial stress.
[03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:38.560]   And then when the dam breaks, it breaks hard.
[03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:39.840]   So yeah, there's a lot.
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:44.080]   Finance is tricky stuff and you could probably
[03:14:44.080 --> 03:14:47.840]   be wonderful romantic and sexual partners
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:49.720]   and have very different styles
[03:14:49.720 --> 03:14:52.960]   of how you handle your finances.
[03:14:52.960 --> 03:14:55.680]   And how you handle your finances is informed by
[03:14:55.680 --> 03:14:58.400]   not only your individual psychology
[03:14:58.400 --> 03:14:59.880]   but also how you were raised
[03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:03.000]   and how your family taught you about finance
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.240]   and how you should conduct your finances.
[03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:07.560]   - And there's interesting power dynamics in play.
[03:15:07.560 --> 03:15:08.600]   - Tremendously, yeah.
[03:15:08.720 --> 03:15:13.560]   And those are very tricky because
[03:15:13.560 --> 03:15:16.120]   the standard of living of a couple
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:18.760]   becomes important in a divorce.
[03:15:18.760 --> 03:15:22.160]   But sometimes the toxic standard of living
[03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:25.680]   that created toxic levels of stress
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:28.680]   is one of the causes of the divorce.
[03:15:28.680 --> 03:15:32.000]   And so they're asking the court
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:36.360]   to maintain a financial obligation on you
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:39.640]   that is the reason why the marriage fell apart.
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:41.160]   And that feels like a particularly
[03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:44.680]   insulting form of indignity.
[03:15:44.680 --> 03:15:49.000]   - Well, you're a fascinating human being on many levels
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:50.960]   but you're also exceptionally productive
[03:15:50.960 --> 03:15:53.160]   and you've talked to me about waking up early.
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:56.240]   For you, we've met today at 11 a.m.
[03:15:56.240 --> 03:16:00.200]   And for you, that's what, late afternoon, I suppose.
[03:16:00.200 --> 03:16:02.840]   We had to negotiate, come to an agreement
[03:16:02.840 --> 03:16:05.120]   because I went to bed at 4 a.m.
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:07.200]   And I was up at, I get up at four every day.
[03:16:07.200 --> 03:16:08.600]   - You woke up at four at the--
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:10.520]   - Well, I woke, it's three o'clock local time.
[03:16:10.520 --> 03:16:12.440]   So I woke up at three local time.
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:13.720]   Yeah, I wake up at four naturally.
[03:16:13.720 --> 03:16:15.200]   Then my body just wakes up.
[03:16:15.200 --> 03:16:16.040]   - Oh, wow, that's fascinating.
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:18.840]   - And it wakes up full on this speed.
[03:16:18.840 --> 03:16:19.680]   - Wow.
[03:16:19.680 --> 03:16:21.960]   - Like my most productive writing and speaking
[03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:26.080]   is from 4 a.m. until noon or one.
[03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:29.560]   - So can you take me through a productive,
[03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:31.560]   like a perfectly productive day?
[03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:33.660]   - I wake up at 4 a.m. very naturally.
[03:16:34.600 --> 03:16:37.920]   I wish I didn't, but I do check my phone first thing
[03:16:37.920 --> 03:16:40.000]   'cause I wanna see if any emergencies came in
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:41.360]   from a client overnight.
[03:16:41.360 --> 03:16:42.760]   - So work emergencies.
[03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:43.920]   - Yeah, work-related emergencies.
[03:16:43.920 --> 03:16:45.720]   And as a divorce lawyer,
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:51.520]   our definition of emergency can be very serious.
[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:53.320]   It's people absconding with a child.
[03:16:53.320 --> 03:16:56.160]   It's a police being involved in a domestic violence.
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:16:58.240]   And so they can be like time-sensitive things.
[03:16:58.240 --> 03:17:01.000]   And when someone is hiring a divorce lawyer,
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.640]   I think they're hiring, they want someone responsive.
[03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:05.800]   My clients have my cell phone number.
[03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:09.080]   And I go to bed early because I get up early.
[03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:12.360]   And so I go to sleep by 8 p.m. latest.
[03:17:12.360 --> 03:17:15.060]   I don't think I've seen 9 p.m. even on New Year's Eve.
[03:17:15.060 --> 03:17:18.200]   So I wake up at four.
[03:17:18.200 --> 03:17:19.680]   I check my phone, check my email.
[03:17:19.680 --> 03:17:22.340]   Usually, even if there's something that's time-sensitive,
[03:17:22.340 --> 03:17:23.780]   it's usually not so time-sensitive
[03:17:23.780 --> 03:17:25.280]   that it needs to be responded to at 4 a.m.
[03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:27.840]   'cause most other normal people are asleep.
[03:17:27.840 --> 03:17:32.120]   I have espresso, black espresso, which I enjoy very much.
[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:33.760]   And then I work out.
[03:17:33.760 --> 03:17:37.160]   And that someday is gonna be weights.
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:38.640]   A lot of days, it's just gonna be cardio.
[03:17:38.640 --> 03:17:42.880]   I've changed my habits now that I'm in my early 50s.
[03:17:42.880 --> 03:17:44.720]   It used to be much more intensive weight training
[03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:46.080]   and deadlifts and stuff like that.
[03:17:46.080 --> 03:17:48.720]   And then I herniated my L5-S1.
[03:17:48.720 --> 03:17:51.560]   So 485 was my max deadlift.
[03:17:51.560 --> 03:17:53.440]   And now I don't hardly do deadlifts.
[03:17:53.440 --> 03:17:56.000]   - Well, you can still relive the past glory.
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:57.720]   - I do, I still have some pictures of videos.
[03:17:57.720 --> 03:17:58.560]   - You have pictures.
[03:17:58.560 --> 03:17:59.380]   - I have videos.
[03:17:59.380 --> 03:18:00.880]   I have videos of me putting 485 for three.
[03:18:00.880 --> 03:18:02.840]   - You can, in stories, when you talk about it,
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:04.720]   you can exaggerate how much you've actually lifted.
[03:18:04.720 --> 03:18:06.600]   - That's true, but then you can't back it up.
[03:18:06.600 --> 03:18:08.120]   See, I'm very evidence-based.
[03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:10.760]   So if I don't have a photo or a video of it,
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:14.080]   it's just puffing, mere puffery at that point.
[03:18:14.080 --> 03:18:15.920]   But I work out.
[03:18:15.920 --> 03:18:18.480]   And then I try to work out for like a good hour.
[03:18:18.480 --> 03:18:21.420]   And I do that partly because of stress.
[03:18:21.420 --> 03:18:24.320]   I think when I don't work out, it's difficult.
[03:18:24.320 --> 03:18:27.680]   I had a group of guys that I would do jujitsu with
[03:18:27.680 --> 03:18:28.520]   at 5 a.m.
[03:18:28.520 --> 03:18:29.560]   They were mostly law enforcement.
[03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:32.440]   They were cops who would either be starting a shift
[03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:34.120]   or coming off of a night shift.
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:36.800]   And we would train together, just do like an open mat.
[03:18:36.800 --> 03:18:39.120]   And it was at 5 a.m. till six, and that was heaven.
[03:18:39.120 --> 03:18:42.280]   I love training jujitsu first thing in the morning if I can.
[03:18:42.280 --> 03:18:44.920]   And then I always do either a sauna or steam
[03:18:44.920 --> 03:18:46.880]   for 20 minutes, half an hour.
[03:18:46.880 --> 03:18:49.160]   And then I do a cold plunge,
[03:18:49.160 --> 03:18:52.040]   or if I don't have access to a cold plunge, a cold shower.
[03:18:52.040 --> 03:18:54.500]   And then I have breakfast.
[03:18:54.500 --> 03:18:58.240]   And it's usually a very uncontroversial, simple breakfast.
[03:18:58.240 --> 03:19:02.600]   I like to eat, I eat like slow carb, Tim Ferriss type style.
[03:19:02.600 --> 03:19:04.680]   And then I get right to work.
[03:19:04.680 --> 03:19:07.160]   I try to do my drafting early in the day,
[03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:10.240]   prenups, motions, things like that,
[03:19:10.240 --> 03:19:15.240]   from let's say six or seven until nine, 9.30,
[03:19:15.240 --> 03:19:17.480]   which is when court begins.
[03:19:17.480 --> 03:19:20.000]   - So drafting is like writing up different documents.
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:23.200]   - Right, writing prenups, writing separation agreements,
[03:19:23.200 --> 03:19:25.440]   writing settlement proposals, writing motions
[03:19:25.440 --> 03:19:28.420]   for the court, pretrial memos, which is like research
[03:19:28.420 --> 03:19:31.780]   that I wanna present to a judge that supports my arguments.
[03:19:31.780 --> 03:19:34.440]   I do drafting, I review documents that the attorneys
[03:19:34.440 --> 03:19:37.880]   who work for me have drafted and refine them.
[03:19:37.880 --> 03:19:40.880]   And then court is usually from nine o'clock until noon.
[03:19:40.880 --> 03:19:43.580]   And if we're on trial, then it's a whole different pace
[03:19:43.580 --> 03:19:45.960]   because trials, the lunch break
[03:19:45.960 --> 03:19:47.040]   isn't really a lunch break.
[03:19:47.040 --> 03:19:48.880]   You're preparing the afternoon's witnesses
[03:19:48.880 --> 03:19:50.240]   and you're trying to do damage control
[03:19:50.240 --> 03:19:52.240]   on what happened in the morning.
[03:19:52.240 --> 03:19:54.040]   But if it's just court conferences,
[03:19:54.040 --> 03:19:56.280]   like most cases, there's conferences.
[03:19:56.280 --> 03:19:58.320]   Conferences is you go in, you make oral argument,
[03:19:58.320 --> 03:20:00.080]   but you don't have witnesses on the stand,
[03:20:00.080 --> 03:20:01.200]   you're not taking testimony.
[03:20:01.200 --> 03:20:02.980]   It's like everybody's just shouting allegations
[03:20:02.980 --> 03:20:07.360]   back and forth and making temporary arguments pretrial.
[03:20:07.360 --> 03:20:09.560]   It's kind of the foreplay of the trial, right?
[03:20:09.560 --> 03:20:11.400]   - Is that exhausting, by the way?
[03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:14.360]   - It's exhausting when you're done with it.
[03:20:14.360 --> 03:20:17.560]   Like while you're doing it, it's exhilarating.
[03:20:17.560 --> 03:20:20.080]   I always say that I never sleep as poorly
[03:20:20.080 --> 03:20:22.780]   as the night before a trial, and I never sleep as well
[03:20:22.780 --> 03:20:25.000]   as the night I finished a trial.
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:30.000]   Because when I am on trial, I am speaking, listening,
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:35.720]   watching the judge closely to see what they're reacting to
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:38.880]   and when they're paying attention or not paying attention,
[03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:41.480]   watching opposing counsel and the opposing party,
[03:20:41.480 --> 03:20:43.820]   like when is the opposing party writing a little note
[03:20:43.820 --> 03:20:45.040]   to their lawyer to show it to them?
[03:20:45.040 --> 03:20:47.400]   What is the opposing counsel objecting to?
[03:20:47.400 --> 03:20:49.920]   My client is trying to pass me notes half the time
[03:20:49.920 --> 03:20:52.040]   while I'm speaking and making my arguments.
[03:20:52.040 --> 03:20:54.920]   I'm trying to adjust what I'm doing strategically
[03:20:54.920 --> 03:20:58.160]   based on the objections that the judge is ruling on.
[03:20:58.160 --> 03:21:02.120]   So I'm so hyper-stimulated on trial
[03:21:02.120 --> 03:21:04.680]   that when you finish, you can't even talk.
[03:21:04.680 --> 03:21:07.400]   You're gone, your brain is jello.
[03:21:07.400 --> 03:21:09.200]   Conferences is harder because at least with a trial,
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:11.720]   there's a singularity of focus.
[03:21:11.720 --> 03:21:13.760]   Like with a trial, it's just one case
[03:21:13.760 --> 03:21:15.560]   and they have all my attention.
[03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:17.520]   The problem is is then on the lunch break,
[03:21:17.520 --> 03:21:20.040]   all the other cases that I've been ignoring
[03:21:20.040 --> 03:21:22.640]   for the last several hours while I was on trial,
[03:21:22.640 --> 03:21:25.040]   they all have stuff going on.
[03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:26.880]   So it's like, hey, where's that settlement proposal on this?
[03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:29.220]   Hey, she just did this, we need to file a motion.
[03:21:29.220 --> 03:21:32.220]   So now it's like, okay, I have an hour to eat
[03:21:32.220 --> 03:21:34.600]   and to answer all of this in some preliminary way
[03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:35.840]   to delegate some responsibilities
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:38.040]   and then I got to go back in and put 100% of my focus
[03:21:38.040 --> 03:21:39.520]   on this other case again.
[03:21:39.520 --> 03:21:41.480]   So you find yourself in a place,
[03:21:41.480 --> 03:21:42.680]   that's why I'm very disciplined,
[03:21:42.680 --> 03:21:46.820]   is you find yourself in a place where I live my whole life
[03:21:46.820 --> 03:21:49.240]   in six minute increments, tenths of an hour,
[03:21:49.240 --> 03:21:51.080]   'cause we bill in tenths of an hour.
[03:21:51.080 --> 03:21:55.000]   So everything I do, it's like 0.2, 0.4, 0.6
[03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:58.160]   and I'm logging time throughout the day.
[03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:00.980]   And you find yourself at the end of the day,
[03:22:00.980 --> 03:22:04.600]   my son is a lawyer, my older son.
[03:22:04.600 --> 03:22:08.080]   He's a district attorney and I'm very proud of him.
[03:22:08.080 --> 03:22:11.800]   He gets to put bad guys in jail and he's very smart,
[03:22:11.800 --> 03:22:12.960]   he's doing a great job.
[03:22:12.960 --> 03:22:15.340]   He just, about a year ago.
[03:22:16.600 --> 03:22:20.680]   And when he graduated from law school,
[03:22:20.680 --> 03:22:23.840]   we were very close and we were talking and he said,
[03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:27.240]   we were just talking about like the career in the law
[03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:29.120]   that he was about to embark on.
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:31.200]   And I said to him, you know the feeling
[03:22:31.200 --> 03:22:34.720]   at the end of the day, when like all your homework
[03:22:34.720 --> 03:22:37.920]   or all your work is done and you just go,
[03:22:37.920 --> 03:22:41.500]   okay, it's all done now and I'm gonna go home.
[03:22:41.500 --> 03:22:46.500]   You'll never have that feeling ever again, ever.
[03:22:46.940 --> 03:22:51.420]   You're just gonna every day go, all right, it's enough,
[03:22:51.420 --> 03:22:53.820]   it's enough, I gotta get out of here.
[03:22:53.820 --> 03:22:58.140]   Because you could, with every one of these cases,
[03:22:58.140 --> 03:23:01.840]   you could stay up 24 hours focusing just on it.
[03:23:01.840 --> 03:23:04.760]   So you have to have the discipline to go,
[03:23:04.760 --> 03:23:06.140]   yeah, no, that's it.
[03:23:06.140 --> 03:23:08.740]   Like I'm done for now, I've done what I could do today
[03:23:08.740 --> 03:23:11.860]   and now I'm going to sit and read for a half an hour.
[03:23:11.860 --> 03:23:13.960]   I'm gonna watch this show for a half an hour.
[03:23:13.960 --> 03:23:16.340]   I'm gonna have this meal.
[03:23:16.340 --> 03:23:18.660]   Because it's never done, you know.
[03:23:18.660 --> 03:23:19.700]   So that's challenging.
[03:23:19.700 --> 03:23:23.180]   That's a hard part of this job.
[03:23:23.180 --> 03:23:25.300]   But I think my discipline helps with that.
[03:23:25.300 --> 03:23:27.900]   And then I, like I said, I finish my day
[03:23:27.900 --> 03:23:32.900]   around 5.30, six o'clock and I have something to eat
[03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:36.460]   and I try to wind down a little
[03:23:36.460 --> 03:23:39.580]   and I'm usually in bed by 7.30 and asleep by eight.
[03:23:39.580 --> 03:23:41.380]   - Now you mentioned jiu-jitsu.
[03:23:42.980 --> 03:23:43.860]   You're a brown belt.
[03:23:43.860 --> 03:23:46.780]   What role has jiu-jitsu played in your life?
[03:23:46.780 --> 03:23:48.700]   - I love jiu-jitsu.
[03:23:48.700 --> 03:23:51.180]   I trained martial arts from the time I was a little kid.
[03:23:51.180 --> 03:23:52.100]   I think I was seven or eight.
[03:23:52.100 --> 03:23:56.660]   I took up Okinawan Goju karate and I did judo.
[03:23:56.660 --> 03:23:57.940]   And it was always part of my life.
[03:23:57.940 --> 03:23:59.940]   And then I got to college and grad school
[03:23:59.940 --> 03:24:02.660]   and I didn't have time for it and I didn't do it so much.
[03:24:02.660 --> 03:24:03.960]   And then I got divorced.
[03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:05.820]   I was quite young still when I got divorced
[03:24:05.820 --> 03:24:07.420]   and I had two young kids.
[03:24:07.420 --> 03:24:10.620]   And I thought, well, I can like, you know,
[03:24:10.620 --> 03:24:12.420]   grow a goatee and buy a convertible
[03:24:12.420 --> 03:24:13.780]   and do like the thing you're supposed to do
[03:24:13.780 --> 03:24:17.040]   when you're a dude with kids close to middle age.
[03:24:17.040 --> 03:24:20.980]   Or I can try to do something more productive.
[03:24:20.980 --> 03:24:23.340]   And so I said, well, maybe I'll go back to martial arts.
[03:24:23.340 --> 03:24:26.380]   So I took up Muay Thai kickboxing
[03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:29.500]   and they had a jiu-jitsu class
[03:24:29.500 --> 03:24:32.100]   at the same school after the Muay Thai class.
[03:24:32.100 --> 03:24:35.100]   And I had been around the orbit of jiu-jitsu,
[03:24:35.100 --> 03:24:37.200]   having been, my kids took karate
[03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:38.500]   and there was jiu-jitsu there.
[03:24:38.500 --> 03:24:40.220]   It was a Gracie Academy.
[03:24:40.900 --> 03:24:44.620]   And I stayed for a jiu-jitsu class
[03:24:44.620 --> 03:24:49.620]   and I had 120 pound girl rag doll me,
[03:24:49.620 --> 03:24:52.140]   'cause I just knew nothing about grappling.
[03:24:52.140 --> 03:24:53.460]   And I remember just going, well,
[03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:55.140]   I gotta learn what this is.
[03:24:55.140 --> 03:24:56.180]   And that was it.
[03:24:56.180 --> 03:24:57.520]   I just dove into it.
[03:24:57.520 --> 03:25:00.860]   My first professor was Lou Ventolaro in New Jersey.
[03:25:00.860 --> 03:25:03.740]   He's a Hoyler Gracie black belt, great teacher,
[03:25:03.740 --> 03:25:05.340]   taught me amazing fundamentals,
[03:25:05.340 --> 03:25:07.720]   took me all the way up to purple belt.
[03:25:07.720 --> 03:25:09.380]   And then right after I got my purple belt,
[03:25:09.380 --> 03:25:11.660]   I moved to the city, I moved to Manhattan.
[03:25:11.660 --> 03:25:13.420]   I actually chose my apartment
[03:25:13.420 --> 03:25:15.880]   based on its proximity to Marcelo Garcia.
[03:25:15.880 --> 03:25:18.500]   And I moved to West Chelsea
[03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:22.620]   because it was a short walk to Marcelo's Academy.
[03:25:22.620 --> 03:25:25.460]   My core jiu-jitsu was up to purple belt,
[03:25:25.460 --> 03:25:28.300]   it was Lou Ventolaro and then it's been Marcelo.
[03:25:28.300 --> 03:25:30.940]   Marcelo, Paul Schreiner,
[03:25:30.940 --> 03:25:32.980]   who's really phenomenal at his Academy
[03:25:32.980 --> 03:25:34.460]   and all of the people at his Academy,
[03:25:34.460 --> 03:25:36.060]   I mean, are all phenomenal.
[03:25:36.060 --> 03:25:38.620]   I mean, Bernardo Fajao was there
[03:25:38.620 --> 03:25:40.260]   for a period of time that I was there
[03:25:40.260 --> 03:25:42.140]   and before he went to Boston.
[03:25:42.140 --> 03:25:46.060]   Marcos Tinoco was like his lasso guard stuff.
[03:25:46.060 --> 03:25:49.700]   He was at Marcelo's for a long time and what a teacher.
[03:25:49.700 --> 03:25:52.660]   I mean, my lack of skill at jiu-jitsu
[03:25:52.660 --> 03:25:56.100]   is not based on a lack of quality instruction.
[03:25:56.100 --> 03:25:59.300]   It's based on an inability to retain the information
[03:25:59.300 --> 03:26:00.140]   for very long.
[03:26:00.140 --> 03:26:01.740]   - And like for me,
[03:26:01.740 --> 03:26:04.060]   that's one of the most reliable place
[03:26:04.060 --> 03:26:05.700]   I can go to humble myself.
[03:26:06.060 --> 03:26:08.420]   I love jiu-jitsu.
[03:26:08.420 --> 03:26:11.820]   I love the progressive humility
[03:26:11.820 --> 03:26:14.620]   that it drives home constantly.
[03:26:14.620 --> 03:26:18.220]   I love the impossibility of perfecting it,
[03:26:18.220 --> 03:26:20.060]   although Gordon Ryan's probably come close
[03:26:20.060 --> 03:26:22.780]   and Marcelo's probably come close to perfecting it.
[03:26:22.780 --> 03:26:25.420]   - Let me ask you, since you mentioned Gordon Ryan,
[03:26:25.420 --> 03:26:29.820]   so apparently, so I'm close with Gordon
[03:26:29.820 --> 03:26:32.460]   and I'm sure you know in Austin,
[03:26:32.460 --> 03:26:34.580]   just this jiu-jitsu scene, it's incredible.
[03:26:34.580 --> 03:26:36.420]   - It's like a jiu-jitsu mecca.
[03:26:36.420 --> 03:26:38.820]   I'm actually seeing John Donahuer this evening.
[03:26:38.820 --> 03:26:42.060]   - Okay, so he's, I mean, yeah, this is like--
[03:26:42.060 --> 03:26:42.900]   - Yeah, this is amazing.
[03:26:42.900 --> 03:26:44.380]   - A truly special place.
[03:26:44.380 --> 03:26:48.740]   But anyway, apparently long ago, you mentioned Jersey.
[03:26:48.740 --> 03:26:54.020]   There's a bit of a conflict between you and Gordon
[03:26:54.020 --> 03:26:56.460]   and you mentioned to me offline that you love him
[03:26:56.460 --> 03:27:00.940]   and just how much respect you have for him
[03:27:00.940 --> 03:27:01.940]   as an athlete and so on.
[03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:04.100]   But can you explain why there's--
[03:27:04.100 --> 03:27:05.780]   - Yeah, I'm actually glad I have that.
[03:27:05.780 --> 03:27:07.300]   It's funny that you bring it up.
[03:27:07.300 --> 03:27:09.780]   And of all the, we're talking about all these heavy topics
[03:27:09.780 --> 03:27:12.660]   and this is probably the one that I find most,
[03:27:12.660 --> 03:27:14.500]   the most actually emotional.
[03:27:14.500 --> 03:27:18.700]   But Gordon's a very, I think a very young man still.
[03:27:18.700 --> 03:27:21.260]   He's like probably in his 20s or early 30s.
[03:27:21.260 --> 03:27:22.740]   And it's hard to imagine that
[03:27:22.740 --> 03:27:25.060]   'cause he's accomplished so much as an athlete
[03:27:25.060 --> 03:27:26.640]   and as a business person.
[03:27:26.640 --> 03:27:30.540]   But there was a time not that long ago,
[03:27:30.540 --> 03:27:32.640]   I think it was eight or nine years ago,
[03:27:33.660 --> 03:27:36.500]   where he was just a young guy on his way up.
[03:27:36.500 --> 03:27:39.060]   He's only, I think a couple of years older
[03:27:39.060 --> 03:27:41.180]   than my oldest son.
[03:27:41.180 --> 03:27:44.740]   And I, through a series of circumstances,
[03:27:44.740 --> 03:27:47.980]   jujitsu wasn't, it's really exploded in the last 10 years,
[03:27:47.980 --> 03:27:51.180]   but there were not as many people sponsoring
[03:27:51.180 --> 03:27:52.540]   quote unquote super fights.
[03:27:52.540 --> 03:27:54.580]   There really weren't like jujitsu super fights
[03:27:54.580 --> 03:27:57.820]   being sponsored, Jersey and New York in particular.
[03:27:57.820 --> 03:28:02.240]   And I got involved in sponsoring some jujitsu super fights.
[03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:06.700]   And I also got involved in sponsoring some jujitsu athletes.
[03:28:06.700 --> 03:28:11.300]   And Gordon was a young part of the Donahoe Death Squad.
[03:28:11.300 --> 03:28:12.700]   I was friends with Eddie Cummings.
[03:28:12.700 --> 03:28:14.260]   I'm still friends with Eddie.
[03:28:14.260 --> 03:28:17.580]   I was friends with John, still friends with John.
[03:28:17.580 --> 03:28:19.260]   But I didn't really know Gordon.
[03:28:19.260 --> 03:28:20.760]   I actually don't know that I've still ever met.
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:22.620]   I don't think I've ever met Gordon.
[03:28:22.620 --> 03:28:24.380]   I've been in the same room as him.
[03:28:24.380 --> 03:28:27.780]   But there was a fight that I had sponsored
[03:28:27.780 --> 03:28:31.980]   some other fights with this particular promoter.
[03:28:31.980 --> 03:28:33.960]   And they asked me to sponsor one.
[03:28:33.960 --> 03:28:37.000]   And it didn't involve anyone from Marcello's.
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:38.420]   But it involved Gordon.
[03:28:38.420 --> 03:28:39.260]   He was one of the people.
[03:28:39.260 --> 03:28:40.540]   And I liked John very much.
[03:28:40.540 --> 03:28:42.440]   And I liked everybody in the Donahoe Death Squad.
[03:28:42.440 --> 03:28:43.620]   I like watching them compete.
[03:28:43.620 --> 03:28:46.020]   I thought, I think John's just brilliant.
[03:28:46.020 --> 03:28:48.420]   I mean, everyone at Marcello's has such respect for John
[03:28:48.420 --> 03:28:49.260]   and for everyone.
[03:28:49.260 --> 03:28:50.500]   And the stuff they were doing,
[03:28:50.500 --> 03:28:52.200]   like when they were the early days
[03:28:52.200 --> 03:28:53.260]   of that Donahoe Death Squad,
[03:28:53.260 --> 03:28:55.380]   like the Eddie Cummings, like his leg locks,
[03:28:55.380 --> 03:28:57.140]   like he just blew the whole game up.
[03:28:57.140 --> 03:28:59.740]   Like it just was a whole nother thing.
[03:28:59.740 --> 03:29:03.440]   It was like insane what they did, such innovation.
[03:29:03.440 --> 03:29:09.340]   And Gordon at the time, he was online.
[03:29:09.340 --> 03:29:14.380]   And I'm much older than that.
[03:29:14.380 --> 03:29:16.100]   I'm in my early 50s.
[03:29:16.100 --> 03:29:18.100]   And that's not, I guess, chronologically that much older.
[03:29:18.100 --> 03:29:21.220]   But generationally, I think it's quite a bit different.
[03:29:21.220 --> 03:29:25.280]   And Gordon was smack talking with a guy who I,
[03:29:25.280 --> 03:29:28.220]   about a guy who I was sponsor of, who I knew.
[03:29:28.220 --> 03:29:30.180]   And who I knew was a very good athlete
[03:29:30.180 --> 03:29:32.740]   and had been through difficult things in his life.
[03:29:32.740 --> 03:29:36.580]   And Gordon just said some nasty things about him.
[03:29:36.580 --> 03:29:39.700]   It falls into the category
[03:29:39.700 --> 03:29:41.940]   of totally appropriate smack talking, looking at it now.
[03:29:41.940 --> 03:29:44.620]   And looking at what Gordon became,
[03:29:44.620 --> 03:29:46.740]   which is he's someone who talks trash.
[03:29:46.740 --> 03:29:48.980]   It's like part of his brand is to talk trash.
[03:29:48.980 --> 03:29:51.540]   And I see now that that's like a Muhammad Ali thing.
[03:29:51.540 --> 03:29:54.460]   At the time, I just didn't see it as what it was.
[03:29:54.460 --> 03:29:56.600]   And although it doesn't excuse it,
[03:29:57.480 --> 03:29:59.540]   my mother was dying.
[03:29:59.540 --> 03:30:00.980]   I was not at my best.
[03:30:00.980 --> 03:30:03.000]   I was having a hard time.
[03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:06.260]   And Gordon had spoken ill of this person.
[03:30:06.260 --> 03:30:09.100]   And I got upset.
[03:30:09.100 --> 03:30:12.340]   And I reached out to John and to Tom DeBlas.
[03:30:12.340 --> 03:30:13.380]   And I said to them, "Hey,
[03:30:13.380 --> 03:30:15.020]   "can you tell this guy to knock it off?
[03:30:15.020 --> 03:30:17.300]   "Don't talk about this person who I sponsor
[03:30:17.300 --> 03:30:18.640]   "if I'm sponsoring his fight.
[03:30:18.640 --> 03:30:22.020]   "I don't even know this Gordon Ryan kid.
[03:30:22.020 --> 03:30:23.660]   "And I'm sponsoring his fight.
[03:30:23.660 --> 03:30:26.020]   "And he should say thank you.
[03:30:26.020 --> 03:30:28.720]   "Don't talk bad about a person who I financially sponsor.
[03:30:28.720 --> 03:30:30.660]   "Like that's not cool."
[03:30:30.660 --> 03:30:33.720]   And I think on Facebook, he like wrote some comments.
[03:30:33.720 --> 03:30:35.060]   And then I wrote some comments back.
[03:30:35.060 --> 03:30:39.820]   And I was incredibly obnoxious.
[03:30:39.820 --> 03:30:44.820]   And very soon after, I felt really gross.
[03:30:44.820 --> 03:30:46.680]   'Cause I was an adult.
[03:30:46.680 --> 03:30:48.980]   And I was talking to a young person this way,
[03:30:48.980 --> 03:30:50.380]   who's on their way up,
[03:30:50.380 --> 03:30:52.700]   who's like a little older than one of my kids.
[03:30:52.700 --> 03:30:55.960]   And I just said these obnoxious things to him.
[03:30:55.960 --> 03:31:00.660]   And I felt really like, that's gross.
[03:31:00.660 --> 03:31:05.460]   And, but I'd never really thought much about it again.
[03:31:05.460 --> 03:31:08.300]   I watched his star rise and I was very,
[03:31:08.300 --> 03:31:10.780]   I mean, who is not impressed by Gordon Ryan?
[03:31:10.780 --> 03:31:13.160]   And everyone at our academy was always very,
[03:31:13.160 --> 03:31:14.420]   thrilled to see him rise.
[03:31:14.420 --> 03:31:16.420]   And I've stayed friends with John.
[03:31:16.420 --> 03:31:18.260]   And every time Gordon would have a big victory,
[03:31:18.260 --> 03:31:19.740]   I would always text John and be like,
[03:31:19.740 --> 03:31:22.700]   'cause Gordon's victories are John's victories too.
[03:31:22.700 --> 03:31:24.460]   They have such a great bond.
[03:31:24.460 --> 03:31:25.680]   All the people in his orbit,
[03:31:25.680 --> 03:31:28.600]   like are all people that I respect and like.
[03:31:28.600 --> 03:31:30.520]   And I just would say, "Hey, listen, congratulations.
[03:31:30.520 --> 03:31:33.120]   And please pass on my congratulations to Gordon."
[03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:34.960]   And, but we don't know each other.
[03:31:34.960 --> 03:31:35.800]   I don't have his number.
[03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:38.720]   I have no way to contact him to apologize to him.
[03:31:38.720 --> 03:31:43.720]   But, if Gordon hears this, I am profoundly sorry.
[03:31:43.720 --> 03:31:46.800]   I am not, I don't say that
[03:31:46.800 --> 03:31:48.400]   'cause I'm trying to get in your good graces.
[03:31:48.400 --> 03:31:50.960]   I don't know that we'll ever meet each other.
[03:31:50.960 --> 03:31:53.860]   But that was an unbelievably wrong,
[03:31:53.860 --> 03:31:56.820]   stupid thing to say to a young person.
[03:31:56.820 --> 03:31:58.420]   - Well, thank you for saying that.
[03:31:58.420 --> 03:32:01.220]   This warms my heart in general.
[03:32:01.220 --> 03:32:02.260]   - See, you talk to a divorce lawyer
[03:32:02.260 --> 03:32:03.100]   and it warms your heart.
[03:32:03.100 --> 03:32:03.940]   Look at that.
[03:32:03.940 --> 03:32:06.460]   - Well, speaking of which, so what,
[03:32:06.460 --> 03:32:09.500]   you're a romantic actually.
[03:32:09.500 --> 03:32:12.940]   What role, you've seen love,
[03:32:12.940 --> 03:32:15.240]   you've seen love break down completely.
[03:32:15.240 --> 03:32:17.820]   What role does love play in the human condition?
[03:32:19.040 --> 03:32:21.740]   - I mean, I think it's kind of everything, right?
[03:32:21.740 --> 03:32:24.580]   Like it's love is, romantic love,
[03:32:24.580 --> 03:32:26.680]   wars are fought for romantic love.
[03:32:26.680 --> 03:32:29.060]   Empires fall because of romantic love.
[03:32:29.060 --> 03:32:32.820]   Like it takes down kings.
[03:32:32.820 --> 03:32:36.620]   It takes down, you know, like it's,
[03:32:36.620 --> 03:32:39.740]   we're all just struggling for it.
[03:32:39.740 --> 03:32:41.100]   We're all just chasing it.
[03:32:41.100 --> 03:32:42.900]   Like we're all chasing the dragon, you know?
[03:32:42.900 --> 03:32:44.700]   It's like the rush we all are.
[03:32:44.700 --> 03:32:45.540]   So it's huge.
[03:32:45.540 --> 03:32:46.360]   You know, it's huge.
[03:32:46.360 --> 03:32:50.380]   I mean, sex and love,
[03:32:50.380 --> 03:32:53.260]   which I like to believe are in some way connected,
[03:32:53.260 --> 03:32:55.140]   and love and romance, which again,
[03:32:55.140 --> 03:32:57.940]   I like to believe are in some way connected.
[03:32:57.940 --> 03:32:58.760]   I think it's huge.
[03:32:58.760 --> 03:32:59.600]   I think it's a,
[03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:05.520]   look, I've always thought most of what men do,
[03:33:05.520 --> 03:33:09.020]   including me, we do to get laid.
[03:33:09.020 --> 03:33:12.060]   Like on some level.
[03:33:12.060 --> 03:33:14.460]   Like you want to be successful.
[03:33:14.460 --> 03:33:15.300]   Why?
[03:33:15.300 --> 03:33:16.120]   So you can have money.
[03:33:16.120 --> 03:33:19.620]   So you can have nice things so that you can attract
[03:33:19.620 --> 03:33:21.860]   attractive members of the opposite sex.
[03:33:21.860 --> 03:33:25.020]   You know, like a lot of things come down to that.
[03:33:25.020 --> 03:33:27.780]   And even for like men, you know, like red pill,
[03:33:27.780 --> 03:33:30.380]   you know, men who are like, yeah, I don't care about women.
[03:33:30.380 --> 03:33:32.460]   Well, you talk about them an awful lot.
[03:33:32.460 --> 03:33:35.020]   Like for someone that's not interested in women,
[03:33:35.020 --> 03:33:37.140]   you sure are like in the orbit of women
[03:33:37.140 --> 03:33:39.220]   who you're telling how much you don't care about women,
[03:33:39.220 --> 03:33:40.900]   which kind of feels like you're doing that
[03:33:40.900 --> 03:33:43.620]   to attract a certain kind of woman, which I get,
[03:33:43.620 --> 03:33:45.380]   you know, like more power to you.
[03:33:45.380 --> 03:33:49.220]   But like that a person who worships an idol
[03:33:49.220 --> 03:33:51.820]   and a person who destroys an idol are both idolaters.
[03:33:51.820 --> 03:33:52.660]   Yes.
[03:33:52.660 --> 03:33:55.580]   So you're, if all you're talking about
[03:33:55.580 --> 03:33:57.220]   is how you don't need women,
[03:33:57.220 --> 03:33:59.260]   you're talking about women an awful lot.
[03:33:59.260 --> 03:34:03.820]   So it's just such a splinter in people's mind,
[03:34:03.820 --> 03:34:07.060]   you know, relationships, breakups.
[03:34:07.060 --> 03:34:09.600]   And like, it's such a great equalizer.
[03:34:09.600 --> 03:34:12.220]   I mean, you're spending some time in the rarefied air now
[03:34:12.220 --> 03:34:15.220]   of like big celebrity people.
[03:34:15.220 --> 03:34:18.020]   And I remember when I started out as a lawyer,
[03:34:18.020 --> 03:34:20.540]   just doing like the regular, like the cop and the teacher
[03:34:20.540 --> 03:34:23.660]   with a 401k and they didn't have any assets.
[03:34:23.660 --> 03:34:24.500]   I remember thinking like, well,
[03:34:24.500 --> 03:34:28.980]   someday if I represent celebrities or wealthy CEOs,
[03:34:28.980 --> 03:34:30.460]   like it'll be different.
[03:34:30.460 --> 03:34:31.740]   They'll be like smarter.
[03:34:31.740 --> 03:34:32.900]   They'll be like different.
[03:34:32.900 --> 03:34:36.020]   It's just the same weird petty shit,
[03:34:36.020 --> 03:34:38.460]   the same infidelity, the same.
[03:34:38.460 --> 03:34:41.860]   The same kind of insecurities, the same kind of jealousy,
[03:34:41.860 --> 03:34:43.500]   the same kind of fights.
[03:34:43.500 --> 03:34:44.580]   It all.
[03:34:44.580 --> 03:34:46.180]   It's all the same.
[03:34:46.180 --> 03:34:47.540]   But it is, it's like,
[03:34:47.540 --> 03:34:51.940]   and it's all the same insecurity, sadness.
[03:34:51.940 --> 03:34:55.820]   It's the same like desire to be validated,
[03:34:55.820 --> 03:35:00.060]   like mommy issues, daddy issues, like intimacy issues,
[03:35:00.060 --> 03:35:01.840]   you know, and it's all the same stuff.
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:06.840]   And just because you're really good at other things,
[03:35:06.840 --> 03:35:09.460]   like I've represented professional athletes
[03:35:09.460 --> 03:35:13.100]   who are phenomenal, world-class, you know,
[03:35:13.100 --> 03:35:18.060]   doctors, business people, and they suck at relationships.
[03:35:18.060 --> 03:35:20.860]   No better than like anybody else.
[03:35:20.860 --> 03:35:22.660]   Like there's no, you know,
[03:35:22.660 --> 03:35:25.020]   there's no connection between the skills
[03:35:25.020 --> 03:35:26.500]   that made you a good entrepreneur
[03:35:26.500 --> 03:35:28.740]   and the skills that made you a good, you know,
[03:35:28.740 --> 03:35:29.660]   spouse or partner.
[03:35:29.660 --> 03:35:30.820]   I'm sure there's some overlap,
[03:35:30.820 --> 03:35:32.060]   like patience is good
[03:35:32.060 --> 03:35:34.620]   and thinking strategically is probably good.
[03:35:34.620 --> 03:35:39.300]   But I'm just humbled by how we're called to it still.
[03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:41.900]   Like it's so, and even when we lose
[03:35:41.900 --> 03:35:43.780]   and even when like our greatest pains
[03:35:43.780 --> 03:35:45.760]   were caused by our desire to love
[03:35:45.760 --> 03:35:47.900]   and be loved in a romantic sense,
[03:35:47.900 --> 03:35:51.700]   we just keep putting the money on the table and playing.
[03:35:51.700 --> 03:35:54.820]   Like we won't just quit, we just keep going, you know?
[03:35:54.820 --> 03:35:55.700]   And-- - A little mess of it
[03:35:55.700 --> 03:35:56.660]   is worth it.
[03:35:56.660 --> 03:35:58.980]   - I mean, I guess so.
[03:35:58.980 --> 03:36:01.220]   Like it's calling us.
[03:36:01.220 --> 03:36:02.540]   I don't know if it's worth it or not.
[03:36:02.540 --> 03:36:03.720]   That's a value judgment, right?
[03:36:03.720 --> 03:36:07.140]   But we don't stop.
[03:36:07.140 --> 03:36:11.020]   I don't know a lot of people that they played the hand,
[03:36:11.020 --> 03:36:11.860]   they lost and they went,
[03:36:11.860 --> 03:36:14.020]   "Well, no more of that game for me."
[03:36:14.020 --> 03:36:15.580]   Like, I'm not a good poker player,
[03:36:15.580 --> 03:36:16.820]   I'm not playing poker anymore.
[03:36:16.820 --> 03:36:18.580]   Like I know people who've done that.
[03:36:18.580 --> 03:36:20.460]   I know people that are like, "Listen, I don't drink.
[03:36:20.460 --> 03:36:21.540]   "Like, you know, I'm allergic.
[03:36:21.540 --> 03:36:23.300]   "I break out in handcuffs and hospital bills.
[03:36:23.300 --> 03:36:25.300]   "Like I'm not drinking anymore."
[03:36:25.300 --> 03:36:26.760]   But I don't know people that are like,
[03:36:26.760 --> 03:36:30.380]   "Man, that relationship, I screwed that up
[03:36:30.380 --> 03:36:31.640]   "or I got screwed on that one.
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:33.340]   "I'm not doing that anymore."
[03:36:33.340 --> 03:36:35.260]   You can say that, everybody says that.
[03:36:35.260 --> 03:36:37.680]   "I'm through with love, you know, I'm done."
[03:36:37.680 --> 03:36:39.100]   They're not, they keep going.
[03:36:39.100 --> 03:36:40.880]   They'll go up again.
[03:36:40.880 --> 03:36:43.620]   - Never gonna fall in love again.
[03:36:43.620 --> 03:36:46.220]   And then a few weeks later.
[03:36:46.220 --> 03:36:48.020]   - Yeah, I got job security, man.
[03:36:48.020 --> 03:36:49.420]   I got job security.
[03:36:49.420 --> 03:36:52.620]   People are not gonna stop walking down that aisle.
[03:36:52.620 --> 03:36:55.620]   They are not gonna stop having kids
[03:36:55.620 --> 03:36:57.940]   with people that they probably should have thought through
[03:36:57.940 --> 03:37:00.300]   whether they would have kids with that person or not.
[03:37:00.300 --> 03:37:01.300]   - But I'm glad they are.
[03:37:01.300 --> 03:37:02.740]   I'm glad they're taking that leap.
[03:37:02.740 --> 03:37:04.840]   I'm glad they're taking that risk.
[03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:07.900]   It's this whole beautiful mess that we're all a part of.
[03:37:07.900 --> 03:37:10.420]   It's like taking that risk,
[03:37:10.420 --> 03:37:12.500]   taking that leap of vulnerabilities
[03:37:12.500 --> 03:37:13.780]   of what this whole thing is about.
[03:37:13.780 --> 03:37:16.280]   - Yeah, and what a danger if we didn't, you know?
[03:37:16.280 --> 03:37:21.280]   Like every, you hear about people like Alexander Hamilton
[03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:25.060]   or you hear about people who like,
[03:37:25.060 --> 03:37:28.800]   they were born of circumstances that like,
[03:37:28.800 --> 03:37:31.820]   these two people should never have had a kid.
[03:37:31.820 --> 03:37:32.780]   And then they did.
[03:37:32.780 --> 03:37:35.220]   And that kid changes the world, you know?
[03:37:35.260 --> 03:37:37.900]   And like moves the dial forward.
[03:37:37.900 --> 03:37:41.300]   What a great mistake.
[03:37:41.300 --> 03:37:44.020]   Like what a great, you can't ever say it's a mistake.
[03:37:44.020 --> 03:37:46.660]   Like what an amazing thing that happened.
[03:37:46.660 --> 03:37:49.760]   And I think that that's one of the things I like
[03:37:49.760 --> 03:37:51.900]   about divorce as a practice
[03:37:51.900 --> 03:37:54.420]   and as almost looking at it like a spiritual practice.
[03:37:54.420 --> 03:37:59.420]   I think you just don't know what is a blessing,
[03:37:59.420 --> 03:38:00.740]   right, in the world.
[03:38:00.740 --> 03:38:01.820]   Like you just don't know.
[03:38:01.820 --> 03:38:06.820]   Like I, my father, I've spoken about this before publicly
[03:38:06.820 --> 03:38:08.460]   and he does frequently.
[03:38:08.460 --> 03:38:09.900]   My father's an alcoholic.
[03:38:09.900 --> 03:38:12.980]   My father's been in recovery now for seven years, I think.
[03:38:12.980 --> 03:38:15.940]   Yeah, but he was a bad alcoholic,
[03:38:15.940 --> 03:38:18.100]   Vietnam veteran my whole life
[03:38:18.100 --> 03:38:21.280]   and only got sober, you know, when I was in my 40s.
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:27.380]   And a lot of the personality characteristics I have
[03:38:27.380 --> 03:38:31.260]   are consistent with those of adult children of alcoholics,
[03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:34.460]   you know, desire for control and control issues,
[03:38:34.460 --> 03:38:37.440]   you know, a lot of those things.
[03:38:37.440 --> 03:38:40.620]   And I love my life.
[03:38:40.620 --> 03:38:41.940]   Like I'm having a great time.
[03:38:41.940 --> 03:38:45.180]   If I died tomorrow, man, I did more, learned more,
[03:38:45.180 --> 03:38:49.300]   earned more, loved more than I ever dreamed.
[03:38:49.300 --> 03:38:53.900]   And so I'm so glad my dad was an alcoholic.
[03:38:53.900 --> 03:38:56.560]   And if you said to me, how do you raise kids?
[03:38:56.560 --> 03:38:57.400]   Like I wouldn't say like,
[03:38:57.400 --> 03:38:59.180]   well, you definitely wanna be an alcoholic
[03:38:59.180 --> 03:39:01.460]   'cause like your kid's getting a lot of really good
[03:39:01.460 --> 03:39:03.180]   discipline lessons from that experience.
[03:39:03.180 --> 03:39:05.300]   Like, no, like I wouldn't, you know,
[03:39:05.300 --> 03:39:08.980]   I wouldn't want that for, but it's born,
[03:39:08.980 --> 03:39:10.820]   like all these wonderful things
[03:39:10.820 --> 03:39:13.340]   were born of this awful situation.
[03:39:13.340 --> 03:39:15.460]   So I think divorce is the same thing.
[03:39:15.460 --> 03:39:18.340]   Like we make these mistakes, right?
[03:39:18.340 --> 03:39:20.220]   But they're not really, you know,
[03:39:20.220 --> 03:39:22.260]   I often have to say to my clients when they're like,
[03:39:22.260 --> 03:39:23.780]   oh, I wish I'd never married this person.
[03:39:23.780 --> 03:39:25.620]   I'm like, you love your kids, right?
[03:39:25.620 --> 03:39:29.100]   Like your kids are half that person.
[03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:32.820]   They would not be the organism they are
[03:39:32.820 --> 03:39:35.460]   without that person's DNA.
[03:39:35.460 --> 03:39:39.800]   So you can't regret being with that person
[03:39:39.800 --> 03:39:41.400]   if you love your kids.
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:42.540]   Like if you love your kids,
[03:39:42.540 --> 03:39:44.940]   those kids don't exist without that person.
[03:39:44.940 --> 03:39:49.100]   And I don't know how we refocus on that.
[03:39:49.100 --> 03:39:51.140]   You know, I don't know, maybe we give anyone
[03:39:51.140 --> 03:39:54.340]   going through a divorce, I've actually had a theory,
[03:39:54.340 --> 03:39:56.780]   which I've not said out loud, but I'll say it to you
[03:39:56.780 --> 03:39:58.740]   'cause it's just us talking.
[03:39:58.740 --> 03:40:03.740]   I think if we could figure out a way
[03:40:03.740 --> 03:40:05.940]   to take a divorcing couple
[03:40:05.940 --> 03:40:10.740]   that is interested in potentially mediating
[03:40:10.740 --> 03:40:13.540]   and put them in a setting
[03:40:13.540 --> 03:40:16.500]   where we could give them both psilocybin,
[03:40:16.500 --> 03:40:19.980]   like a good dose, like two and a half, three grams,
[03:40:19.980 --> 03:40:24.100]   and have them do individual sessions with, you know,
[03:40:24.100 --> 03:40:27.760]   controlled setting with a guide, right?
[03:40:28.760 --> 03:40:31.720]   And have them sort of do that inner work
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:36.040]   and then have them do some kind of a session together
[03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:37.640]   after they've had that experience,
[03:40:37.640 --> 03:40:39.280]   that psychedelic experience.
[03:40:39.280 --> 03:40:42.840]   I actually think you could do transformative divorce work
[03:40:42.840 --> 03:40:46.240]   because I have found myself and certainly the many people
[03:40:46.240 --> 03:40:50.040]   that I've talked to who've had psilocybin experiences
[03:40:50.040 --> 03:40:52.360]   and in particular, but any psychedelic experience,
[03:40:52.360 --> 03:40:54.160]   many of the empathogens, right?
[03:40:56.600 --> 03:40:59.040]   Or even like MDMA, you know, like MDMA,
[03:40:59.040 --> 03:41:01.520]   which is an empathogen.
[03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:04.280]   If we brought that space
[03:41:04.280 --> 03:41:08.400]   and the divorce and conflict resolution space together,
[03:41:08.400 --> 03:41:13.400]   that sort of psychopharmacological intervention on empathy,
[03:41:13.400 --> 03:41:17.880]   one's empathy receptors or one's connectivity,
[03:41:17.880 --> 03:41:21.200]   I think that could be radically transforming.
[03:41:21.200 --> 03:41:23.280]   It would be logistically an absolute nightmare.
[03:41:23.280 --> 03:41:25.840]   It would never get done from a legal standpoint,
[03:41:25.840 --> 03:41:30.360]   but man, like, I think sometimes like that,
[03:41:30.360 --> 03:41:35.360]   because I think the more that you can bring people
[03:41:35.360 --> 03:41:39.360]   to the awareness of connection
[03:41:39.360 --> 03:41:44.000]   that comes from many people's psychedelic experiences,
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:46.160]   I think they could then extrapolate that
[03:41:46.160 --> 03:41:49.640]   into their understanding of the conflict
[03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:52.440]   and disconnect they're having with their partner.
[03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:57.440]   - So really lean into the, like use this brink of divorce
[03:41:57.440 --> 03:42:01.760]   as a kind of catalyst for doing a lot of soul searching,
[03:42:01.760 --> 03:42:03.480]   a lot of growth together.
[03:42:03.480 --> 03:42:05.120]   - That was what appealed to me about it.
[03:42:05.120 --> 03:42:07.040]   I mean, before I started doing it,
[03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:10.280]   is it was this idea that this is a opportunity
[03:42:10.280 --> 03:42:14.880]   for radical reinvention.
[03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:18.160]   Like it was an opportunity for people to say,
[03:42:18.160 --> 03:42:19.520]   okay, now what?
[03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:21.720]   Like, I didn't expect that, now what?
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:24.440]   And it was to be part of the architecture of that.
[03:42:24.440 --> 03:42:25.920]   Like, I didn't look at it like
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:28.520]   I'm helping demolish the building.
[03:42:28.520 --> 03:42:30.840]   It was like, I'm tearing down the building
[03:42:30.840 --> 03:42:33.080]   so we can build the new one,
[03:42:33.080 --> 03:42:35.360]   which I hope is filled with joy and abundance
[03:42:35.360 --> 03:42:38.560]   and peace and love and real love, real satisfaction.
[03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:43.560]   Like my ex-wife is married for over a decade now
[03:42:43.560 --> 03:42:47.960]   to a phenomenal guy who is perfect for her.
[03:42:47.960 --> 03:42:50.840]   And he's nothing like me, by the way.
[03:42:50.840 --> 03:42:54.320]   Like if you met him and you met both of us,
[03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:57.600]   you'd go, well, no one could love both of these guys.
[03:42:57.600 --> 03:42:59.280]   'Cause like, if you like this flavor,
[03:42:59.280 --> 03:43:00.480]   you wouldn't like this flavor.
[03:43:00.480 --> 03:43:04.200]   Like I am impatient, fast talking, like skip to the end,
[03:43:04.200 --> 03:43:05.560]   we gotta land this plane, come on.
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:08.960]   And he's like, he's therapist, he's chill,
[03:43:08.960 --> 03:43:12.520]   he's like patient and they're perfect together.
[03:43:12.520 --> 03:43:15.080]   And I can say that as someone who loves her and loved her,
[03:43:15.080 --> 03:43:17.200]   you know, and knows her or knew her.
[03:43:17.520 --> 03:43:22.000]   And I think if we can, you know,
[03:43:22.000 --> 03:43:25.960]   if we can radically view honestly,
[03:43:25.960 --> 03:43:30.640]   without jealousy, without the sense of like,
[03:43:30.640 --> 03:43:32.560]   look at it and just go, yeah, yeah, okay.
[03:43:32.560 --> 03:43:35.480]   Like this is the love this person needed.
[03:43:35.480 --> 03:43:37.600]   Like that doesn't mean my love sucks,
[03:43:37.600 --> 03:43:39.560]   just means it wasn't the right one for this person.
[03:43:39.560 --> 03:43:41.000]   You know, like there's someone,
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:43.040]   there's a lid for every pot, you know?
[03:43:43.040 --> 03:43:45.280]   Like she found her lid, I want her to find her lid,
[03:43:45.280 --> 03:43:46.880]   that's good, you know?
[03:43:46.880 --> 03:43:48.760]   - And there's billions of pots out there
[03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:50.880]   and we just need to match them with the proper lid.
[03:43:50.880 --> 03:43:52.400]   - Yeah, not hit each other over the head
[03:43:52.400 --> 03:43:53.360]   with them all day long.
[03:43:53.360 --> 03:43:56.720]   - Yeah, man, this is such a romantic few hours
[03:43:56.720 --> 03:43:58.120]   we've got to spend together.
[03:43:58.120 --> 03:44:00.720]   And there's even a candle burning over there.
[03:44:00.720 --> 03:44:02.080]   - Is there? Oh, that's lovely.
[03:44:02.080 --> 03:44:03.280]   - All right, brother, thanks so much, James.
[03:44:03.280 --> 03:44:05.080]   - Thank you, thanks for having me.
[03:44:05.080 --> 03:44:06.520]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:07.680]   with James Sexton.

[03:44:11.240 --> 03:44:14.180]   And now let me leave you with some words from Rumi.
[03:44:15.080 --> 03:44:17.760]   Your task is not to seek for love,
[03:44:17.760 --> 03:44:21.120]   but merely to seek and find all the barriers
[03:44:21.120 --> 03:44:24.920]   within yourself that you have built against it.
[03:44:24.920 --> 03:44:27.880]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:44:27.880 --> 03:44:30.460]   (upbeat music)
[03:44:30.460 --> 03:44:33.040]   (upbeat music)
