[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.280]   that's very hard for anyone going through a divorce to do about their own relationship. You know, we don't know who discovered water, but it wasn't a fish. Like, if you're in it, I don't think you see it clearly. I think as a divorce lawyer whose job is to really drill down on the facts and figure out what's going on in this story. I have to look at both sides. So I have to think a lot about my own arguments, but I also have to think about what's the other lawyer's argument going to be, especially in custody cases. So I really
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.280]   have been
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.980]   really
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.000]   been
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:43.200]  ,
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:06:12.460]  ,
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.100]   I
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.260]   have been, I think, I think people can construct a good, like if you ask GPT, what do they mean? I think the story that would come up is a pretty good one. But, you know, that's a story you tell about when you first knew the disconnection has begun is when you stopped buying my favorite granola or when she stopped giving blowjobs. I would say when it's reached like a critical mass. Yeah.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:43.300]   Because I think it started before that when she said, yeah, I used to give him blowjobs. And, you know, when we were in our early relationship. And then one day, like, I just was like, oh, well, you know, we don't have as much time. Like, well, I'll wait until later and we'll have sex. And then we both enjoy it. Blowjobs are inefficient. Yeah, exactly. Correct. So you batch it all together. Yeah. So she said, well, you exactly. And they had kids at that point. So I think she really was like, hey, we've gotten certain window. Yeah. So let's have something we both enjoy. So I don't think she had any negative intentions.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:07:13.340]   I think that she was working in good faith towards the betterment of the relationship, but it was having this second order effect. And so I really do think that, yeah, the blowjobs granola. I mean, there anyone who's been in a long term relationship. I guess it's just worth asking the question. What does this person do that makes me feel loved? Because I,
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.340]   I think that's a good question.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.340]   I think that's a good question.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:43.380]   and I think it's very interesting in my own experience in life. I remember I had a difficult chapter with one of my sons, my younger son, when he was in his early 20s. And we were having a heartfelt conversation and I said to him, do you, do you know I love you? And he said, well, yeah, of course I do. I said, but do you feel my love like you feel it, you know, not just do you know it intellectually, do you feel it? And I remember thinking to myself, when do we feel someone's love?
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.380]   I think it's very interesting in my own experience in life.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.380]   I remember I had a difficult chapter with one of my sons, my younger son when he was in his early 20s and we were having a heartfelt conversation and I said to him, do you know, do you know I love you? And I said, of course I do you feel my love.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:50.420]   Right. Like what what is it that they do? And sometimes it's the weirdest, silliest things that they would never know.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.420]   They are the person who's showing us they love us and that we're feeling their love.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.420]   They would never show us like if you said, why, why does this person love you?
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:07.420]   They wouldn't say, oh, because I always make sure that when the paper comes, I bring it from the bottom of the driveway to the door so they don't have to go out and get it.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:13.420]   Or I always hold the door for them or I, you know, oh, I always like again, I buy the granola that I know that I love.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:13.420]   I always make sure that when the paper comes, I bring it from the bottom of the driveway to the door so they don't have to go out and get it.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:43.460]   I remember that they don't like it when I put on this particular record, so I don't put it on like and those are these.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:43.460]   Yes, they're small things, but they're not small. They're kind of everything.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:43.460]   Do you think it's good to communicate that stuff?
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:43.460]   Well, 100%. It takes away some of the power of it, right? When you point it out, then the person realizes, okay, he likes this or dislikes it. So yes, there becomes a deliberate need to do it.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:43.460]   So I think it's good to communicate that stuff.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:43.460]   Well, 100%. It takes away some of the power of it, right?
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:43.460]   When you point it out, then the person realizes, okay, he likes this or dislikes it.

[00:08:43.460 --> 00:09:13.500]   When you point it out, then the person realizes, okay, he likes this or dislikes it.

[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   Because that little something is probably a kernel of a deeper truth.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   Of course, there's also moods.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   We're all like a rollercoaster of emotions.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   So, you can not bring a granola one day just because you're in this place where just nothing is,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   just cynicism everywhere, just anger and so on.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   But it's a temporary feeling.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.180]   But maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper kernel.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper kernel.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper kernel.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper kernel.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper kernel.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper kernel.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper kernel.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.180]   Maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper kernel.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:38.520]   and I think a good partner wants to understand the current of their partner.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   and I think a good partner wants to understand the current of their partner. They want to understand, like, hey, are you going through something. And look, if I'm the one you need to take it out on, that's okay. I'm a big boy. I can take it. If you're hormonal, if you're frustrated at work, if you're whatever, we should be able to have a little bit of that interaction in a relationship.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   I think a good partner wants to understand the current of their partner. If you're frustrated at work, if you're whatever, we should be able to have a little bit of that interaction in a relationship.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:44.760]   But I do think it's so easy to just say to people, communication is the key.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.460]   But it really is about fearless kinds of communication.
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:56.860]   It's about really honestly saying to somebody, you know, this feels like something to me.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.660]   Am I wrong?
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.560]   Like, this just feels like something to me.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.060]   And also how that's presented.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.860]   I mean, one of the things I'm very, you know, I'm very caught up on or feel very strongly about,

[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.400]   you know like and that to me is when because I think we're just so criticized by the world the world is so full of criticism we criticize ourselves so harshly that having a partner who no matter what is like you've got this I'm with you like you fuck okay yeah you screwed up I see it look I'm not gonna lie to you about your blind spots you screwed up but you know what people screw up sometimes got a right to screw up a lot of people screw up come on get up let's go I know you have it in you if you have that person like that I feel like that's a

Like I, I've always, I think I say it somewhere in the book that, you know, you go to weddings and like when the bride walks in, you know, everybody's looking at the bride for show, you know, everybody turns around as the first glimpse, everybody gets the bride. And I never look at the bride. I always look at the groom looking at the bride because there's this, like, to me, that's every, like, he has this look like this.

[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:25.500]   "I'm not sure if I'm gonna die, eventually. Might as well really go all in on relationships."
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:31.980]   There's a line in "Drugstore Cowboy," a great film, where he says, "We played a game you couldn't win to the utmost."
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:40.700]   And I think everything, I think life is a game you can't win. And so you play it to the utmost.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:47.780]   Like to love anything is insane, because you are accepting that you're going to lose it.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.340]   Like I'm a dog person.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:42.200]  , "I'm not sure if I'm gonna die, eventually. Might as well really go all in on relationships."
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:23:12.060]  . But I think it's not to me surprising that as the performative aspects of life on social media increases, people's satisfaction with their relationships and the divorce rate is following the same trend. Because I think everyone's going, "Well, what's everybody else doing?" "Well, how much sex is everyone else having?" The only two people that should worry about how much sex you're having are the two people. If the two people are happy in the relationship, great. Don't worry about that.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:42.080]  , "What's everybody else doing?" Yeah, there should be an element to great relationships and great friendships of like, "Fuck the world." It's us versus the world. Yeah, us. Us. And that's what I mean when I say that thick as thieves. When they're like a unit like that. Because it's, look, it's just us. It's just what we want, what we like. And that's why I said, even when it comes to sex or things like that, if you can't be candid with your partner about whatever weird shit you're into or what fantasy you have, then you're not going to be candid about what you're into.

No, but part of being a relationship is, okay, if you're into this, I'm going to pretend this song is a good song, you know, even though it's not my favorite song. And I think I just don't know. We've turned sex. I mean, sex has been so politicized in recent years. Maybe it always was. But I think we've made it into something where we can't just, I don't know.

You know, there's nothing in school that teaches us about it. So much of literature and art is an idealized version of it. So little of it is real. And no matter how it evolves, when it ends in tragedy or drama, I feel like what people don't do enough is appreciate the good times.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:56.500]   Like, appreciate how beautiful it is to having taken the risk and to having experienced that kind of love. I think when you look at people and they're divorcing each other, there's a Edgar Allan Poe quote, "The years of love have been forgot in the hatred of a minute." I always kind of am saddened, like deeply saddened, how people seem to forget how many beautiful moments have been shared.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:25.740]  , when some reason, some drama, some breakup leads them to part ways. Yeah, yeah, it's interesting that you came to that not being a divorce lawyer because I've felt that way for a long time. And I really try to say to my clients, like in the courtroom at the negotiating table, I have a role to play where I have to be sort of like a pit bull or some kind of like a courtroom sociopath, but behind closed doors, like I'm very candid with people and try to be much more emotionally attuned with them.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:25.740]   You're in a situation where you're really struggling with the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:54.980]   You're an empath in the sheets and sociopath in the streets. Exactly. Correct. That's well said. I've been a boy. I got a new tattoo idea. That's good. I like that. I, I, but I, I do believe when I'm behind closed doors with people, I say to them, how you end things is going to be how you're going to remember the whole thing. And, and that's unfortunate because you know, you watch like a two hour movie and if the last 15 minutes of it sucked, you go, well, that movie sucked like well, the first hour and 45 minutes, you know what I'm talking about?
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   You're an empath in the sheets and sociopath in the streets.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   You're an empath in the sheets and sociopath in the streets.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   Exactly.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:24.220]  , you know, you walk out with this bad taste in your mouth.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.220]   I, I'm genuinely in awe of how easily people forget that they loved each other.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.220]   And, and I'm amazed because by the time I meet them and by the time they, they hire me to be a weapon against the person they were in love with, there's nothing but animosity there.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.220]   And so I have to try to imagine that I'm not going to be an empath in the sheets.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.220]   And I'm going to try to imagine that I'm not going to be an empath in the sheets.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.220]   And I'm going to try to imagine that I'm not going to be an empath in the sheets.

[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   that is how it is. And the rest is just narrative that we've put on top of it culturally for some reason. Well I think to push back a little bit, I think memory can also, I think it is a deliberate choice because I think memory can basically, that's how trauma works, it can surface the negative stuff and the negative stuff completely drowns out all the positive. So I think it's a deliberate choice to have a memory.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   I think it's a deliberate choice to have a memory. It probably works that way. You know, in relationships betrayal can do that, right? Sort of cheating, infidelity, like one event can almost erase the entirety of your understanding of the past and all the memories are sort of shrouded in this darkness of, okay, what I believed was true is totally untrue. And sort of to overcome that and still appreciate the beautiful moments.
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:41:18.720]   and I'm continually astounded by how long the hurt and anger of betrayal can reverberate. I have clients who were four years, five years past when the divorce ended, the cheating was discovered and they're as angry as they were the day they found out. And I don't know what that's about.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   Yeah.

[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.860]   or look back at Google search.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.080]   I did that recently.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.560]   Just looking at what I searched for,
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.220]   like 10 years ago, 15.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.080]   It's like, forget last week,
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.120]   just look at your Google searches last week.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.300]   And you're like, wait a minute.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:12.300]   What, why did you just search for this 50 times?
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.360]   - Right.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.600]   Why did the Karate Kid 3 pop in?
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   - Why did the Karate Kid 3 pop in?
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   - Why did the Karate Kid 3 pop in?
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   - Why did the Karate Kid 3 pop in?
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:15.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:15.700]   - Why did the Karate Kid 3 pop in?
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:15.760]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:45.780]   - Yeah, exactly.

I was really mad. Do you think that was good? No. Do you think it was helpful with your co-parenting relationship with her? No. Why did you send it then? You know, she sent me like 50 texts exactly like that and I never responded and I pushed it down every time. And then finally I just blew up at her.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   It's a good thing.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:31.360]  ,
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   You know, I wish I could say I would, but the truth is I'm human and I was at my limit and I'm watching opposing counsel cross out entire sheets of their cross-examination because it's gone now. They thought that they had their like Perry Mason moments. They had their like, did you order the code red moments and it's gone now because if you just own and accept your fault or your issues in the relationship, you can take a lot of the power out of that and you can just go back and do it again.

[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:00.580]   The next day, Maddie got a, you know, a good grade on her science thing. "Oh, that's great. She's doing so well. It makes me so happy."
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:00.580]   Yeah, her teacher said she's doing really well. Yeah, that's really great to see. I'll be there about 15 minutes late. No problem, see you then.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:00.580]   Wait, like, it was a day ago. Was there some, I want to know, was there a phone conversation in between where one of you went, "Hey man, listen, I'm really sorry about that. Ah, no, look, we were both pissed, whatever." Or is it just like you did that and then we're supposed to pretend that didn't happen?
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:00.580]   Or is it just like you did that and then we're supposed to pretend that didn't happen?
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:00.580]   Or is it just like you did that and then we're supposed to pretend that didn't happen?
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:30.600]  ,
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   Yeah, well, sometimes a good nap or a good night's sleep can solve a lot of emotional issues.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   I totally get it, but is there some, if you're looking just at the text, like it begs the question, wouldn't you take the nap and then go, "Hey, listen, I just woke up from the nap. It turns out I was really tired." Is that not happened by text?
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   No, that's important, because sometimes it's hard to probably apologize for being an asshole, right? So I think we use just text, we humans use
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:38.660]   all kinds of forms of communication to kind of vent. I think it's the wrong thing to do, but people do do that.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:43.500]   Text has a permanence, though, it's writing. I mean, it's writing. You just think like a lawyer. I like it.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:55:00.620]   You do think like a lawyer, but lawyers think like detail, you know? And why would you write that down? Like, you know, writing it down? Like, would you write it down and would you put it on a billboard in Times Square? Because like that's explain- everything you say on Facebook or Instagram
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:00.620]   You know, everything you say on Facebook or Instagram

[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:30.640]  , you know, everything you say on Facebook or Instagram can and will be used against you in a court of law. Like every photo you post.

[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   I mean, I understand the point of view that by bringing that suit Johnny Depp was saying, "Look, I - yeah, I have to show these awful things to the world about myself, but it's not as bad as what she's claimed I've done."
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.960]   So I get it. I'm not saying that's incorrect.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:56.960]   And for Amber Heard, I think her response is, "Well, for him to say I'm lying, you know, I'm not saying that's incorrect."
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:56.960]   So I get it. I'm not saying that's incorrect.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:56.960]   And for Amber Heard, I think her response is, "Well, for him to say I'm lying, you know, I'm not saying that's incorrect."
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:25.220]  , but my god, like, what an awful thing to watch.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:25.220]   All it really is is just another couple.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:25.320]   You know how banal that is.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.420]   That kind of stuff happens a lot.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:25.460]   A lot?
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:25.520]   It's the norm.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:25.620]   It's not the exception.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:25.620]   They just happen to have like a grand scale because they have lots of people around them and lots of money.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:25.620]   But yeah, it's all this kind of dysfunction.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.700]   that kind of dysfunction.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:26.960]   that's the other people.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:40.220]   That kind of chaos, that kind of he said, she said, two people with completely differing histories of what happened in the marriage, false allegations of domestic violence or true allegations of domestic violence that are completely denied by the person.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.260]   And you have witnesses that will say, "Oh, my god, they never engaged in any kind of..."
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.880]   Because again, no one engages in domestic violence with company over.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.220]   You know, you don't like invite friends.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.780]   Like people always say, "Oh, no, I saw them.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.780]   They seem so happy."
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.120]   Like people always do this to me as a divorce lawyer.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.960]   They come in and they go, "Well, here's photos of the kids, you know,
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:56.980]   you know, you don't like invite friends."
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:56.980]   You know, you don't like invite friends.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:26.980]  , you know, you don't like invite friends."
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:57.020]  , you know, you don't like invite friends."

I look at it as I'm trying to help a client build their post-divorce life. To sort of rise from the ashes of that which has fallen apart and move on to the next chapter and refocus and have the things they need financially, emotionally, whatever it might be interpersonally in terms of their kids. And so for me it's actually a job that is very consistent with what I'm doing.

[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:01.460]   Some friend called me and said,
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.660]   We have an adoption event.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.700]   Can you just watch this dog for 24 hours and then we'll take him.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.040]   You know, we just need, you know, and I went, yeah, all right.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.200]   I'll watch the dog for the night, you know, and this dog coming.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.340]   They say, oh, he has mange.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.540]   He's not going to. Fuck, I got another dog.
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:15.340]   He walked in.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.600]   My heart went, yeah, I got a dog.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.800]   And now that dog is 13 years old and his eyes are cloudy
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.300]   and he doesn't go up the stairs real well and he's going to break my heart.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:57.140]  , he's going to break my heart.
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:57.300]   And I wouldn't change that for the world.
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:57.300]   I'm still there.
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:57.300]   I'm still struggling for the second one.
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:57.300]   I've lost a dog and broke my heart.
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:57.300]   Yeah, but. And you'll never. You'll never lose that pain.
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:57.300]   But I promise you, your heart has an infinite capacity for the kind of love you felt with that dog. And you'll never feel a love that replaces the whole.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.580]   Like there will never be another buster for me.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:04.920]   But there was Kava.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.760]   And like, you know what?
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.260]   Like and when he's gone, there will never be another one of him.
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.380]   But you know what?
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:19.300]   Like when when that stupid puppy that was five months old stumbled in, I went,
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.920]   I guess I'm going to do this again.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.140]   And you know, I'm so glad I'm so glad.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:27.300]   And I know, by the way, I know now because and that's where I've said
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:57.300]  -
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   That's where I've said, like, you know, it's that Joseph Brodsky poem, you know, a song.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   Like I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   Like I wish I didn't know the pain.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   But you know what?
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   Like I don't care.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   I don't care.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   I don't care. And I believe we don't care I think there's something to that.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   If something hurts so badly and you go, I'm going to do it again.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   But it must be of value. It must be of real value.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:06.800]   like

And so like that intensifies the feeling that that's when you can have pure love without the drama. - Dogs are for me a great example. And again, I don't know what it all means, right, existentially. But I just feel like they have that that kind of love has to be here to teach us something. And I feel like it's a great example of what it means to be a dog.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:25.800]   - Yeah, it's finite and eventually it's gonna be over.

[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:55.300]   - Yeah, it's a great example of what it means to be a dog. - And I feel like the fact that they're so amazing and just so loving and so wonderful and the bond we feel is so amazing and deep and doesn't require a lot of maintenance. And yet it's so finite, like it's just a short little lifespan. And I feel like there's just such a lesson there, you know, there's so much there to unpack about the nature of connection and loss and, you know, that your heart is not the only thing that's gonna be there.
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:18:25.300]  ,

You know, if he goes, like, yeah, you're right, I'll just stay here, it's cool. You know, like, this is, I didn't want to deal with that anyway. Like, he's not the hero anymore, then.

[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:26.180]   rend the Ben Affleck movie, the town, you know, that scene, that's friendship to me. I mean, to me, the the ideal male friendship is the scene where he says, I need you to come with me, we're gonna hurt some people and you never have to ask me about it again. Oh, yeah. And he says, Whose car are we taking? Yeah. And that's sort of like, to me that friendship. So it's a high bar, you know, to be like a friend. So when you say like, friendship, I think that's the kind of friendship you should ideally have with your romantic partner.
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:26.200]   The other thing I think about is friendship. I think that's the kind of friendship you should ideally have with your romantic partner.

[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:54.940]   the other thing I think about is friendship. I think that's the kind of friendship you should ideally have with your romantic partner. If you're getting married, it should be the like whose car we taken. Like it should be that it's you and me. To be fair that bars reached with me with a lot of people. Like if you called me tomorrow, there's a body. But you're a big open, big open heart. But it's true, like I wonder how many people out there are like that in terms of hiding the body. I mean, my theory on this, because I think I'm like you.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.140]   In that way, I think I think I.
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.680]   I'm very sensitive.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:15.520]   I feel things really deeply, you know, and I think it's it's that's a terrible world is terrifying when you feel things very deeply because there's so much pain, there's so much betrayal.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:23.100]   There's so many opportunities to be hurt, you know, and I think when you are that kind of person.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.860]   You go through.

You know, it's very hard, but it can also be a superpower because I think when you can bring that to a relationship, when you can bring that to a profession like you've done and I've done, then there's something very magical about that. The ability to bring it out in your life.
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:25.060]   And I think that's a very, very important thing.

[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:44.220]   So I thought
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:46.820]   I'm going to put in a provision that says
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:49.020]   that as long as the children are
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:56.520]   so young that they can't independently purchase a Mother's Day or a birthday present for the co-parent.
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:49:26.600]  ,
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:26.600]   So you can't buy anything that's for the child.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:26.600]   Yes.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:26.660]   Yes. So you can't buy anything that's for the child.
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:56.600]   I'm not your co-parent. Who cares? You maybe you want them to have the worst birthday ever fine, but you don't want your child to be embarrassed. And I even put in the provision. The parties acknowledge that it is the intention of this provision to ensure that the child is not embarrassed and feels you know that they were able to say I cannot tell you how many people refuse to sign that how many lawyers said to me we're taking that out and I went wait why why why does my client have to buy a present for your client?
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:56.600]   I'm not going to buy a present for your child.

That's what you're doing. Like marriage from a legal standpoint. What we mean when we say I got married is it is a, it's a state agency. It's been created by the state. Like this is a, a legal status that most people who are in it know nothing about.

[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:05.080]   So you're creating a set of rules and then you both can function under those rules during the merits. For a brief time I taught a family law drafting class at a law school and when we would do separation agreements and we would do pleadings, it was lots of fun. When we would do pre-nups I would say to the students, what's the main thing you need when you're doing a pre-nup and they would say well you need asset disclosure, and I'd say that's not the main thing.
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:05.080]   So you're creating a separate agreement and we would do pleadings, you know nothing about.
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:05.080]   you know nothing about.
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:05.080]   you know nothing about.
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:11.360]   well
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:34.220]   case. The.,,, ayty
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:08:05.140]   rendition of the ruleset. You know, if this is going to be a submission only event, you know, if this is going to be no time limit, you know, if we're after a certain number of minutes, we're going into points now. Okay. So I can work with that ruleset and I'm going to amend my game. Based on that ruleset, same thing, same thing. You're just going to say, look, what's the ruleset. Let's agree on the ruleset. And then let's conduct ourselves with the ruleset in mind. Let's plan the ruleset in mind. And I think that, you know, by the way, and if you're going to cheat, you cheat with the ruleset.
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:05.160]   We're going to cheat.
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:35.200]   You know, you're cheating, right? You know, you're trying to get around the ruleset.
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:35.200]   So prenups are when I do a consult for a prenote. The first thing I do is here's what's going to happen legally. If you marry without a prenup, here's what happens to your rights and obligations. Then what we can change with that. There's almost no limit. You can you can amend anything you want to. The example I always give is there was a case that went up to the appellate court.
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:35.200]   The court was going to give you a case that went up to the appellate court.
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:35.200]   The court was going to give you a case that went up to the appellate court.

Like, there's the sense of infidelity, which is kind of like, oh, I'm going to be a lawyer, I'm going to be a lawyer, I'm going to be a lawyer, I'm going to be a lawyer.

[02:18:11.660 --> 02:18:27.440]   So people were sneaking around and having affairs with their same sex partners, and then they get caught. And then, you know, it really was a function of the, of the, of the, um, the fact that they were closeted. Um, and again, that's another kind of complicated dynamic.

[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:48.740]   Transportation, all of that.
[02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:53.840]   So you're not interested in this because you want, you're my favorite person, but this
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:57.560]   is fun so I want to just try this for a few, but then also I don't want to forget about
[02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:58.560]   this.
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:23:59.560]   Like it just seems tricky.
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:04.200]   That analogy by the way is brilliant and also I guess it's tricky because the consequences
[02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:08.600]   of mistakes are quite high because you're gonna have to talk about it.
[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:12.320]   Right and there's an easy way to misinterpret the data, right?
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:16.680]   Like so if I'm, if I really like sleeping with my partner, but I just don't want to
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:16.680]   be sleeping with my partner, then I'm gonna have to talk about it.
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:16.680]   Right and there's an easy way to misinterpret the data, right?
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:16.680]   Like so if I'm, if I really like sleeping with my partner, but I just don't want to be
[02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:45.660]   in the same situation.
[02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:45.720]   Right and there's an easy way to misinterpret the data, right?
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:45.780]   But I get one chance to sleep with this other person.
[02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:45.880]   Like well of course I should indulge in that because I can do this anytime.
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:45.960]   Like what did you know?
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:46.080]   But this person, my partner might interpret that as, oh so you're more interested in her than me because
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:46.120]   that voice in my partner that would be insecure might hear that.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:46.160]   So I just, why would you even, why would you open yourself up to that level of chaos?
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:46.180]   You seem to love chess in the courtrooms.
[02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:46.180]   There's a kind of intimate chance to do that.
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:47.920]   Intimate human chess of sorts.
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:50.120]   Yeah, no, that's, that's too high risk.
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:51.180]   How do we get on threesomes?
[02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:53.080]   Oh, open, open marriages.
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:54.820]   Well we got, how do we get on threesomes?
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:57.620]   I don't know, I always wonder how people get on threesomes.
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:00.160]   I think if they like, if one is fun, two must be better.
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:03.060]   If two is better, three must be better.
[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:08.760]   Yeah, I, I think we, we, the way that, that this becomes an issue is,
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:12.960]   why would you have a non-monogamous relationship?
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:15.680]   It, what is it about your sex life with this person?
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:15.780]   Right.
[02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:15.820]   Yeah.

[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:35.040]   I have to know the other side's case much better than my own.
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:35.040]   I have to know what are their defenses, what are their strengths.
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:35.040]   I have to map out a strategy that keeps those in mind.
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:35.040]   And that's hard because early in my career, I would attribute to the other side an intelligence and strategy that sometimes wasn't applicable.

[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:05.060]   I think sextants would never attribute to strategy that which could be attributed to stupidity or laziness.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:05.060]   Yeah.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:05.060]   Because I have lots of adversaries that they'll not file a motion I thought they were going to file.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:05.060]   I think sextants would never attribute to strategy that which could be attributed to stupidity or laziness.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:05.060]   I'll go, wait, why didn't they file that tactically? What are they thinking I'm going to do? What is that about?
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:05.060]   I'll go, wait, why didn't they file that tactically? What are they thinking I'm going to do? What is that about?

[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:40.120]   Yeah.
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:41.120]   Do you do jury?
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:42.120]   No, we don't do jury trials.
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:43.120]   That's the interesting thing about family law attorneys.

[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:47.120]   We do bench trials.
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:48.120]   We just persuade.
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:49.120]   There's a person in a black robe.
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:50.120]   That's the only person I have to convince.
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:51.120]   Does the person in the black robe, do they have emotions?
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:52.120]   Are they human or are they very...
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:53.120]   They are human.
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:54.120]   They are all too human.
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:55.120]   Do they impose that humanity on you?
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:56.120]   Like, do you feel it?
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:57.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:58.120]   Oh, yeah.

[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:24.160]   Like, they're human.
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:25.160]   They're working their shit out.
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:26.160]   Okay.
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:27.160]   They're parents.

[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:40.320]   Like we have these, I like living in a world that has due process.

[02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.360]   I also like living in a world where people are so emotionally invested in connection to other like. Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:52.460]   Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:54.360]   Those two things aren't mutually exclusive. They shouldn't be.
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:54.360]   They shouldn't be.
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:58.360]   They shouldn't be. I know, but if you dedicate yourself fully to the law, you might lose some of the humanity.
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:47:58.460]   I know, but if you dedicate yourself fully to the law, you might lose some of the humanity.
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:00.360]   I know, but if you dedicate yourself fully to the law, you might lose some of the humanity. I don't think you have to.
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:00.460]   I don't think you have to.
[02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:22.500]  , I have to tell you, I once actually went off on a DA, on a district attorney who was very vehemently prosecuting a child sex abuse case that I was involved in.
[02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:22.600]   , I have to tell you, I once actually went off on a DA, on a district attorney who was very vehemently prosecuting a child sex abuse case that I was involved in.
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:22.600]   , I have to tell you, I once actually went off on a DA, on a district attorney who was very vehemently prosecuting a child sex abuse case that I was involved in.
[02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:36.640]   And I came in right away.
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:36.640]   Because very often you get this case, there have been 15 interviews, this person's been interviewed by police, by Child Protective Services, and it's like they've already, they're already so far down a hole they didn't even know they dug themselves into it, you know?
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:38.640]   So I got in very early on.
[02:48:38.640 --> 02:48:40.640]   And I just kept saying, she's like, well, we're going to do this, we're going to do this.
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:42.640]   And I just kept saying, she's like, well, we're going to do this, we're going to do this.
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:42.640]   I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't, we should both want this to be fair, done properly.
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:44.640]   I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't, we should both want this to be fair, done properly.
[02:48:45.180 --> 02:49:10.680]   Like, there's an expert, a well-respected expert who's a clinical psychologist whose job is to, they're validation experts.
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:12.680]   So their job is to interview a child.
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:13.680]   They record the interviews with a hidden camera so that everyone can see they didn't ask suggestive questioning.
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:14.680]   They're very stringent standards that they follow to prevent suggestive questioning or any of those kinds of things.
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:14.680]   And I was saying, you know, I was in a position where I was trying to get a little bit of privacy, and I was saying, well, I'm not sure what I was doing, I'm not sure what I was doing, but I was talking about the fact that I was doing it.
[02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:20.720]   I was saying, listen, no, no one should be interviewing this child other than this person who's a neutral, qualified person.
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:24.720]   And I kept saying to the other side, like, wait, you know, you're, see, this is the problem.
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:25.720]   Like, you want to win.
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:26.720]   You're a lawyer.
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:27.720]   You want to win.
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:28.720]   I want to win too, right?
[02:49:28.720 --> 02:49:29.720]   But, but, but we want to win fair.
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:30.720]   Like, that's like saying, you know, I'm going into a boxing match.
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:31.720]   I want to win.

[03:23:42.200 --> 03:23:47.260]   Your brown belt. What role has Jiu Jitsu played in your life? I,
[03:23:47.260 --> 03:23:51.100]   I love Jiu Jitsu. I, I trained martial arts from the time I was a little kid,
[03:23:51.100 --> 03:23:56.100]   I was seven or eight. I took up Okinawan goju karate and I did judo.
[03:23:56.100 --> 03:23:57.940]   And it was always part of my life.
[03:23:57.940 --> 03:23:58.840]   And then I got to college and grad school.
[03:23:58.840 --> 03:23:58.840]   I took up Jiu Jitsu.
[03:23:58.860 --> 03:24:28.060]   and I didn't have time for it and I didn't do it so much.
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:28.060]   And then I got divorced.
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:28.060]   I was quite young still when I got divorced and I had two young kids and I,
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:28.060]   um, I thought, well, I can like, you know, grow a goatee and buy a convertible and do like the thing you're supposed to do when you're a dude with kids and middle close to middle age. Or I can, I can try to do something more productive. And so I said, well, maybe I'll go back to martial arts. So I took up Muay Thai kickboxing and they had a Jiu Jitsu class.
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:28.060]   And I took up Muay Thai kickboxing and they had a Jiu Jiu class.
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:28.060]   And I took up Muay Thai kickboxing and they had a Jiu class.
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:28.060]   And I took up Muay Thai kickboxing and they had a Jiu class.
[03:24:28.080 --> 03:24:57.280]   That's the same school after the Muay Thai class. And I had been around the orbit of Jiu Jitsu, having been my kids took karate and there was Jiu Jitsu there as a Gracie academy. And I stayed for a Jiu Jitsu class and I had 120 pound girl rag doll me like because I just knew nothing about grappling. And I remember just going, well, I got to learn what this is. And that was it. I just dove into it.
[03:24:57.280 --> 03:24:57.280]   My first professional fight was a Jiu Jitsu.
[03:24:57.300 --> 03:25:26.500]   in New Jersey, the Hoyler Gracie black belt, great teacher taught me amazing fundamentals, took me all the way up to purple belt. And then right after I got my purple belt, I moved to the city, I moved to Manhattan. I actually chose my apartment based on its proximity to Marcella Garcia. And I moved to West Chelsea because it was a short walk to Marcella's academy. My core Jiu Jitsu was up to purple belt, it was Louvin to Laura and then Jiu Jiu Jitsu was up to purple belt, I moved to Manhattan.

[03:29:04.980 --> 03:29:19.340]   Gordon at the time was, he was online and I'm much older than that. You know, I'm, I'm in my early fifties and that's not, I guess, chronologically that much older, but generationally, I think it's
[03:29:19.340 --> 03:29:19.340]   quite a bit different.

[03:29:47.560 --> 03:29:49.360]   And Gordon was smack talking with a guy who I, about a guy who I was sponsor of, who I knew and who I knew was a very good athlete and had been through difficult things in his life. And Gordon just said some nasty things about him. It falls into the category of totally appropriate smack talking, looking at it now, and looking at what Gordon became, which is he's someone who talks trash. It's like part of his brand is to talk trash. And I see that he's a very good athlete.
[03:29:49.360 --> 03:29:49.360]   I think that he's a very good athlete.
