[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   we have been encouraged culturally to criticize people we're in long-term relationships with not
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.320]   new relationships new relationships you put the person on a pedestal you're allowed to just oh
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.920]   they're wonderful but every trope out there in every form of popular media is like the wife
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.960]   rolling her eyes at the husband and the husband being like oh this loathsome harpy that castrated
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.040]   me as if like people are just passive players in their lives and i i think that is an incredibly
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.440]   toxic message to send to people that this is how we should be relating to our partner like
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.240]   we should not you don't take the piss out of your partner in front of people like the successful
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.240]   relationships i've seen are where people are just cheering for their partner where they are thickest
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.280]   thieves where there is just this feeling of like man they like each other like they are
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.760]   they got each other's back like you wouldn't believe like man you could take sides against
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.960]   anybody but take sides against their partner you're going down like
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:07.040]   and that when when you see a couple that has that you just you know it's that's so hard to break but
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:16.480]   but i think that comes from having like a steadfast yeah no i don't do that like i don't talk
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.480]   my partner yeah like and you don't talk my partner to me you know like and that to me is
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.680]   when because i think we're just so criticized by the world the world is so full of criticism we
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.120]   criticize ourselves so harshly that having a partner who no matter what is like you've got this

[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.200]   blind spots you screwed up but you know what people screw up sometimes got a right to screw

[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.400]   messy roller coaster ride we call life this is alex friedman podcast to support you and your family

[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.680]   please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's james sexton
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.240]   what is the most common reason that marriages fail that's a great question but it's a question
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.800]   that everybody wants there to be a simple answer like they want me to say cheating or money or you
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.200]   know the internet but but the reality is i think it's a lot of little things it's this disconnection
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.480]   that would be my answer the reason marriages fail is disconnection what causes disconnection
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   that's the bigger and i think more important question because like tom wolf said about
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.640]   bankruptcy it happens very slowly and then all at once disconnection happens very slowly and then
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:20.240]   all at once so most of the time what i think people want is an answer like cheating but
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.400]   cheating is the big all at once thing how did we get to the place where cheating was even something
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.960]   you were thinking about doing or that you would think about and then cross the line from thought
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.840]   into action and that's i think the the big question so disconnection would be my answer
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.960]   do you think it's possible to introspect like looking backwards for every individual case where
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.560]   the disconnection began and how it evolved sure yeah this is such a multivariate equation it's a
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.960]   it's a dance it's a chemistry it's a it's what did you do and what did the other person do and see
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.920]   that the interesting thing about being a divorce lawyer is i'm weaponizing intimacy in a courtroom
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.400]   so i'm i'm telling it's full context storytelling what i do for a living
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.440]   so what i do is i take my client's story and i have to present it to a judge and make my client
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.480]   the hero in every way and the other side the villain in every way now i have to be careful
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.920]   to be careful not to do that in a manner that that loses credibility because even a judge would know
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.560]   even a judge is smart enough to know that no one's all good or all bad but
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.080]   only if you were reverse engineering a relationship and saying how did this break
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.880]   you really have to look at both people the good and the bad you know what what each of them did
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.480]   that moved the dial in these different directions and i think that that's um that's very hard for
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.400]   anyone going through a divorce to do that and i think that's a really important thing to think
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   about if you're in a relationship and you're not sure what to do about their own relationship you
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.560]   know we don't know who discovered water but it wasn't a fish like if you're in it i don't think
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.040]   you see it clearly i think as a divorce lawyer whose job is to really drill down on the facts
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.400]   and figure out what's going on in this story i have to look at both sides so i have to think a
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.160]   lot about my own arguments but i also have to think about what's the other lawyer's argument
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.320]   going to be especially in custody cases so i really have been forced to look at both sides
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.120]   many years so deeply in relationships that once you do that it's very you realize that the good
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.680]   guy bad guy thing just doesn't apply i wonder if it's the little things or a few big things
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.200]   that cause this connection whether it's i mean you've talked about granola and blowjobs
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:44.080]   um but those seem to be stories that you can tell to yourself like um maybe maybe that story should
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.000]   be explained uh or maybe you don't think you don't think granola and blowjobs is self-explanatory
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.240]   almost
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.960]   almost i think i think people can construct a good like if you ask gpt what do they mean
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.600]   i think the story that would come up is pretty good one but you know that's a story you tell about
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.520]   when you first knew it's the disconnection has begun is when he stopped putting my buying my
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.280]   favorite granola or when she stopped giving blowjobs i would say when it's reached like
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.160]   a critical mass yeah phase shift because i think it started before that when she said yeah i i
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.320]   used to give him blowjobs and you know when we were in our early relationship and then one day
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.600]   like i just was like oh well you know we don't have much time like well i'll wait until later
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.640]   and we'll have sex and then we both enjoy it blowjobs are inefficient yeah exactly correct so
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.400]   you batch it all together yeah so she said well exactly and they had kids at that point so i think
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.360]   she really was like hey we've gotten certain window yeah so let's have something we both enjoy
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.920]   so i don't think she had any negative intentions there i think that that she was working in good
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.080]   faith towards the betterment of the relationship
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.440]   and she was like well i'm not going to give him a second order effect
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.520]   and she was like well i'm not going to give him a second order effect
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:07:00.000]   and so i i really do think that yeah the blowjobs granola i mean there anyone who's been in a long
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.480]   term relationship i guess it's just worth asking the question what what does this person do that
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:18.000]   makes me feel loved because i i i think it's very interesting in my own experience in life i was
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.120]   i was remember i had a difficult chapter with one of my sons my younger son when he was in his early
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:30.160]   20s and we were having a heartfelt conversation and i said to him do you do you know i love you
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   and he said well yeah of course i do i said but do you feel my love like do you feel it you know not
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.640]   just do you know it intellectually do you feel it and i remember thinking to myself when do we feel
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.920]   someone's love right like what what is it that they do and sometimes it's the weirdest silliest
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.520]   things that they would never know they are the person who's showing us that they love us and that
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.600]   we're feeling their love they would never show us like if you said why why does this person love you
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.920]   they wouldn't say oh because um i always make sure that when the paper comes i bring it from
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.120]   the bottom of the driveway to the door so they don't have to go out and get it
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.400]   or i always hold the door for them or i you know oh i always like again i buy the
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.840]   granola that i know this person likes you know or i i remembered that they don't like it
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.400]   when i put on this particular record so i don't put it on like and and those are these yes they're
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.240]   small things but they're not small they're kind of everything do you think it's good to communicate
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.160]   that stuff well a hundred percent it takes away some of the power of it right when you
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:42.240]   point it out then the person realizes oh okay he likes this or dislikes it so yes
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.760]   there becomes a deliberateness to it you know a conscious so i understand not pointing that
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:56.160]   out when it's a good thing i think when it's a negative thing like i i think in in the granola
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:06.480]   situation if she had said to him hey you used to do this and you've stopped that feels like
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.320]   something to me like she said she didn't say anything about that just like he probably didn't
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:17.680]   say anything about the blowjobs like i think if there had been a moment of this is starting let's
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.440]   talk about it while it's starting but people wait from what i can see people wait until the big
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.040]   thing happens the financial impropriety the substance use disorder the cheating they wait for
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:36.400]   that to happen and then they go where did we go wrong and the answer is quite a while ago with the
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:47.600]   granola yeah yeah yeah so when you notice something like you notice that little something talk about
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.200]   that little something is probably a kernel of a deeper truth of course there's also moods we're
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.080]   all like a roller coaster of emotion so you can not bring a granola one day just to just because
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.160]   you're in this place where just not nothing is yeah just cynicism everywhere just anger and so on
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.560]   but it's a temporary feeling but maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:17.520]   deeper current that's actually building up yeah and i think a good partner wants to understand the
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.080]   current yeah their of their partner they want to understand like hey are you going through
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.440]   something like and look if i'm the one you need to take it out on that's okay like i'm a big boy i
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.480]   can take it you know like if you're hormonal if you're you know frustrated at work if you're
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.760]   whatever like we should be able to you know to to have a little bit of of that interaction in a
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:45.680]   relationship but i i do think it's so easy to just say to people communication is the key but it is
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:54.640]   not just about communication it's about really honestly saying to somebody you know this this
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.360]   is feels like something to me am i wrong like this just feels like something to me
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.560]   and also how that's presented i mean one of the things i i'm very
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:11.760]   you know i'm very caught up on or or feel very strongly about is that we we have been encouraged
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.360]   culturally to criticize people we're in long-term relationships with not new relationships new
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.080]   relationships you put the person on a pedestal you're allowed to just oh they're wonderful
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.120]   but every trope out there in every form of popular media is like the wife rolling her
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.240]   eyes at the husband and the husband being like oh this loathsome harpy that castrated me
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.160]   as if like people are just passive players in their lives and i i think that is
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.440]   an incredibly toxic message to send to people that this is how we should be relating to our
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   partner like we should not you don't take the piss out of your partner in front of
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.200]   people like the successful relationships i've seen are where people are just cheering for
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.920]   their partner where they are thick as thieves where there is just this feeling of like man
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.880]   they like each other like they are they got each other's back like you wouldn't believe like man
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.440]   you could take sides against anybody but take sides against their partner you're going down
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:17.200]   like and that when when you see a couple that has that you just you know it's that's so hard to break
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:26.560]   but but i think that comes from having like a steadfast yeah no i don't do that like i don't
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:33.120]   talk my partner yeah like and you don't talk my partner to me you know like and that to me is
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.320]   when because i think we're just so criticized by the world the world is so full of criticism we
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:45.680]   criticize ourselves so harshly that having a partner who no matter what is like you've got this
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.120]   i'm with you like
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.200]   you okay yeah you screwed up i see it look i'm not gonna lie to you about your blind spots you
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.400]   screwed up but you know what people screw up sometimes got a right to screw up a lot of people
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   screw up come on get up let's go i know you have it in you if you have that person like that i i
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.200]   feel like that's a that's a superpower to have that effect on another person yeah one of the
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:12.640]   things i love seeing when you look at a couple and one is talking uh like in an interview
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.040]   yeah answering a question especially like intellectual questions like uh
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.560]   what do you think about the war in ukraine or something and then the partner is talking and
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:29.760]   the other the other person is looking at them as if they're hearing the wisest thing yeah ever like
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.800]   they're they're still looking at them not waiting for their turn to speak not thinking about how's
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.560]   the audience going to take that but they're looking at them like god damn i'm so lucky yeah
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:46.240]   to be with this smart isn't that but there's this and they could be saying the dumbest there's a
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.040]   scene in the movie true romance yeah i love it great movie i mean that gary oldman seems like
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.600]   the greatest scene ever done in in film you know with christian slater and he but there's a scene
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.560]   in it where she holds up a sign to christian slater and it says you're so cool you're so cool
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:07.040]   and i i like man like that's it yeah that's it like i i've always i think i say it somewhere
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.240]   in the book that you know you go to weddings and like when the bride walks in you know
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.160]   everybody's looking at the bride it's her show you know everybody turns around is the first
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.680]   glimpse everybody gets the bride and i never look at the bride i always look at the groom
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:29.760]   looking at the bride because there's this like to me that's every like he has this look like this
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.400]   because this is the first time he's seeing her in the dress most of the time and also he's seeing her
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.560]   like holy she's coming down the aisle we're getting married like but this is it everyone's looking at
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:45.120]   her and and i always look at him because i always think to myself like like like the look on his face
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.320]   is like that's like this feeling of like holy yeah wow okay like that's everyone's looking at her and
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.800]   she's mine and she's coming up here and we're getting married and i feel like yeah like that
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:01.120]   that kind of adoration like i think that's the look we're describing is like adoration
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.840]   like that the words coming out of their mouth that they're like yeah that's mine that one's mine you
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.880]   know that's such a great thing like it's such a great feeling seeing the good stuff like with uh
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.040]   with true romance i mean you could uh make fun of the guy
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.320]   it's totally cringe wearing elvis like essentially being a fake elvis with shades and
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.720]   like what what is he doing it's like watching these kung fu movies but from her perspective
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.320]   and from any perspective you could take on him is this is the the baddest who's ever lived
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:39.200]   like he's willing to do those things for me but not like it's almost like an epic heroic figure
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.960]   yeah and that we're living in this epic hero story and what does that do to him though
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:50.240]   yeah that's what see that that's the point like if there's a point to this
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.800]   to this whole thing this whole couple thing yeah isn't that it yeah like i don't i don't
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:03.600]   understand this idea of you know we had a successful marriage we were married for 50
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.640]   something years we were miserable for 47 of them but we hung in there like it this is an endurance
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.880]   event like the primary relationship of your life you've decided you're going to turn into the
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.120]   the like a 50-mile trail race like why why would you do that like congratulations you you took
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.720]   the concept of monogamy and made it something that two people are absolutely not going to
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.200]   enjoy but you hung in there like congratulations and i understand there's religious perspectives
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.520]   that say well it's a sacred covenant but i i have a real chicken or the egg problem with that
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.920]   because i think it was like well how do we sell this incredibly stupid concept
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.800]   that isn't working to people i know we'll tell them god says you have to and and we'll sign on for
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:52.320]   that i i don't buy it i don't buy it anymore i really because when you see a successful marriage
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.280]   or you see to be even without a marriage you see a pair bond you see a couple
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.560]   that really love each other and cheer for each other in that way and like hang on each other's
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.920]   words that way and like are just in each other's corner that way you see the fake instantly
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.720]   yeah like you you see the difference right away it's like if you you know the first time i've this is
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.960]   first time i've come to austin i've i've thought i'd eaten a lot of barbecue in my life i've never
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.440]   had texas barbecue i landed i went and had barbecue i was like okay i've never had barbecue
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.000]   before apparently this is this is a whole different thing i think it's the same thing i
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.800]   think it's like once you see real love like real love and and i mean romantic love like real love
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.480]   like that real bond real you go oh yeah this other thing's not gonna do it do you think that's a daily
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.640]   deliberate choice that that a couple like that have to make a choice like that's a good thing
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.200]   that's a good thing that's a good thing that's a good thing that's a good thing that's a good thing
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.320]   that's a good thing that's a good thing that's a good thing that's a good thing that's a good thing
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:55.440]   because it feels like a very easy to do deliberate step like choose to see the brilliant in it the
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.640]   beautiful in it and almost immediately everything shifts and it becomes this momentum where all you
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.200]   see is the beautiful and all you see is the brilliant that is a conscious choice i think
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   approaching life that way is a conscious choice approaching any relationship that
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.560]   way is a conscious choice i mean looking at someone who hurts you or does something
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.320]   hurtful to you and thinking about what's going on in their life that they're doing that or what's
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.760]   happening with them yeah that's a very conscious choice and i think a better one a better one than
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.360]   seething in animosity and letting that eat you alive but but i i don't know that it's
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:37.760]   i don't think it should be so difficult like with our children with our pets
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.240]   we don't have this problem like you never have someone look at their dog who they've had for eight
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:50.160]   years and go i gotta get a new dog like i've had this one for eight years like i gotta get like
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:56.400]   puppies are so cute what am i doing with this old dog like it's the total opposite they're like oh
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.520]   my god this is like my dog this is my dog like the smell of the dog is like this my dog's smell
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.000]   the bad habits of the dog you're like that's my stupid dog that does stupid things and it's not
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.200]   like that has to be a conscious like they wake up every day and go i should be grateful for the dog
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.400]   like it's just visceral it's in them yeah you know and so and your children like people's children
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.000]   you know it's why people are like not aware of how annoying their children are because they're
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.800]   not annoying to them like i get it like to you the sound of your kids shrieking is like oh my
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.240]   kids having a good time and you don't get that and see when i try to when i hear that
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.280]   i try to hear it with those ears like oh that like i'm a parent i get it my kids are adults
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.120]   now but like i get it like so when i hear a kid shrieking i just am like ah like
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.320]   to that parent that's the sound of that kid having a great time and good like it's so
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.280]   nice that that's in the world but it so for me it has to be conscious for that parent i don't think
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:56.800]   it has to be conscious so i i think it would be great if it didn't have to be a conscious practice
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:04.000]   but i wonder if like anything in meditation or mindfulness it's a matter of exercising that way
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.360]   of seeing yeah and then once you've come to that it becomes itself right like it it really does like
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:22.880]   i think it's it initially has to be a conscious practice and and by the way it's easier to make
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:30.720]   it a conscious practice before it started to fade right like the i mean that's what's so amazing
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:36.880]   about marriage is there's like almost eight billion people in the world and you're picking
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:44.160]   this one so when you marry in theory like the stock's at its highest like you're as crazy about
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.920]   each other as you could possibly be so that's the time to get into this mindfulness to get into this
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.400]   practice not once it's like the wheels are starting to come off it's much harder it's like gaining a
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.800]   bunch of weight and saying okay how am i going to lose the weight now well i think that even before
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.320]   marriage like right away just see everything is beautiful let me quote bojack horseman on this
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.640]   when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses all the red flags just look like flags
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.080]   that's great there's a there's a certain sense where if you from the very beginning
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:20.320]   of course you could end up in toxic relationships that way but you know life is short you're gonna
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.480]   die eventually might as well really go all in on relationships there's a line in the drugstore
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   cowboy it's a great film where he says we played a game you couldn't win to the utmost yeah and i
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:41.040]   think everything i think life is a game you can't win and so you play it to the utmost like to love
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.000]   anything is insane
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.680]   because you are accepting that you're going to lose it like i i'm a dog person and i and
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:58.000]   you you get a dog and you you've just resigned yourself to unbelievable pain because this thing's
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.960]   gonna die in like 10 years maybe 15 if you're lucky and why would you open your heart to that
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.000]   why would you let because the joy is just so wonderful of it the of the of the ride up until
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.920]   it same thing with us i mean every marriage every relationship every love is going to end
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:22.400]   it's going to end in death or divorce so why not like just go in like go in like go in and just get
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.880]   get weird you know like don't define it the way that's i mean look at you know again we keep
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.120]   going back to true romance but just get weird like yeah i love this elvis pretending to be weirdo i
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.400]   love this like you know like former sex worker who's like you know like whatever like just go in
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.200]   like love this person have them love you don't worry about what everybody else is doing in their
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   relationship like we're in such i mean it's not to me surprising that that as the performative
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.880]   aspects of life on social media increases people's satisfaction with their relationships and the
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.920]   divorce rate you know is is following the same trend because i i i think everyone's going well
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.240]   what's everybody else doing you know well how much sex is everyone else having are
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.920]   the only two people that should worry about how much sex you're having with two people if the
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.120]   two people are happy in the relationship great then what does it matter what does it matter what
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.280]   everybody else is doing yeah there should be an element to great relationships and great
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.240]   friendships of like the world it's us versus the us it's us and that's what i mean
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.640]   when i say that that thick is thieves like when they're when they're like a unit like that because
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.000]   it's look it's just us it's just what we want it's what we like and that's why i i said like
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.240]   you know even when it comes to sex or things like that like if you can't be candid with your partner
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.040]   about whatever weird you're into or what fantasy you had in any particular you know
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.920]   yeah well then who the hell can you be candid with i mean because you're gonna either go without or go
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   elsewhere and neither of those is a particularly healthy option or helpful option it's it's the
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:02.240]   start of that decline so why why open yourself to that decline which invariably is just the path
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:08.080]   to the chair in front of me in my office yeah you have a full section in your book on on foot
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.960]   fetishes i do i do yeah which is funny because i don't know anything about foot
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.760]   issues yeah like i can't i'm not king shaming anybody but like there's nothing sexual about
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.560]   feet to me at all like i just don't get it i don't but i mean listen if people like things
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:30.480]   it's good you know but yeah i i i have had clients that have odd fetishes or sexual
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.960]   proclivities or things they want to do and they don't share it with their partner at all
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.120]   and then they find an outlet for it because they try to go without it and that doesn't
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.880]   work so they try to find some other outlet for it and then that's interpreted as
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.440]   a betrayal and it creates distance and people split up and of course everybody likes to have
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.320]   like a you know a bad guy to blame it on so when you say well why'd you guys get divorced oh because
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   he secretly had a foot fetish and he was on these message boards like people but well it gives you
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.880]   an easy answer as to why the two of you split up but i don't think you know most divorces have such
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:06.720]   simple answers as it was a foot thing but i also think too like listen if you got a partner i mean
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.080]   we all do stuff that we're not super into because we're in a relationship and that's what part of it
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:12.800]   is like you know i'm not super into it but i'm not super into it but i'm not super into it but i'm
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.120]   not super into it but i'm not super into it but i'm not super into it but i'm not super into it
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.120]   do you really want to go see that chick flick do you really want to eat at this restaurant you
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.360]   really want to go to her cousin's wedding no but you know part of being a relationship is okay if
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.160]   you're into this i'm gonna pretend this song's a good song you know even though it's not my favorite
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.840]   song and and i think i i just don't know we've turned sex i mean sex has been so politicized
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.520]   in recent years maybe it always was but i i think we've made it into something where we can't just
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.400]   i don't know i'm not in defeat but if the woman i love was like you know
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.120]   i'm really in defeat like i really want to do stuff with your feet i'd be like all right i can
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.080]   pretend that i'm into that like for it's not going to kill me yeah no i'm not going to be able to
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.480]   make it a centerpiece of our coupling but you know like yeah i can pretend i'm in defeat if you want
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.920]   i don't personally have any fetishes that are outside of the um
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:07.040]   the normal discourse as a divorce lawyer i get to experience the whole spectrum but if i like
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.640]   if i was into like furries for example yeah i don't know how i would initiate the conversation
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.880]   with my partner about that but but frame the question the other direction if you were into
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:28.640]   furries yeah how do you prevent your partner from knowing anything about that that feels like a real
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:36.320]   you'd have to make a conscious choice to not let your partner know sure sure so so i i i don't think
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.080]   either of those is a particularly palatable or easy proposition but a lot of people live life
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.560]   hiding
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:48.960]   some part of themselves yeah quite unsuccessfully like it the the second order effects of that are
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.760]   very rarely positive sure i don't i don't think i've ever met someone who went yeah i really
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.360]   hid this huge part of myself for an extended period of time and that's the best thing that
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.520]   happened it's i'm really glad i'm really glad i stayed in the closet as long as i did you know
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:07.120]   it really worked out like it rarely does it's a question of how long can you hold it off yeah
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.480]   like i know gay men who stayed in the closet for 40 years 50 years
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:19.760]   of their lives and then they had a successful second chapter as a gay man i've had clients
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:25.520]   like that do they regret that they were in the closet no because they were married they had kids
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.840]   like they had experiences they're glad they had but would their advice to a young person in their
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   20s and 30s who's gay be stay in the closet because then you can have a wife and some kids and
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.400]   then you can come out when you're 50 or 60 and have a second chapter no they would say you know
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   be who you are don't be afraid
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:47.360]   you know as you were talking i'm trying to think of because i i'm publicly and privately i'm the
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.600]   exact same part or try to be the exact same person so i usually try to make sure there's nothing to
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:58.480]   hide but i i was trying to come up with a counter example for you for if there's good things um
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:05.760]   well i mean there could be like past relationships like if i you know slept with thousands of women
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:12.320]   or something like this maybe you want to put that to the side well you don't want to be in there's a different
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.680]   thing you know like if you're in a relationship you're not going to be in there's a difference
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   between being honest about something and being indelicate about it right you know like i i i think
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:30.080]   we all do this with lovers like any of us who've been in more than one relationship you would not
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.880]   you know at the end of sex be like that was the third best sex i've ever had you know like you
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:42.240]   that's it's just indelicate it's rude you know so so i don't think it's a matter of like
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.280]   being honest about it but i think if you were we're using the furry example i'm not picking on
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:55.120]   furries i just think if if that is a proclivity that is anything other than a passing thought
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.960]   like it's something that you just keep coming back to then you're making a conscious decision
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.480]   to withhold it from your partner and what is that out of i mean i would say it's probably out of
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:12.160]   fear i'm not a psychologist but probably out of fear fear that they would reject you that they okay well
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:24.720]   now see i i genuinely believe that that this you know i i'm i'm i'm very conflicted in my religious
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:32.000]   faith but i i don't know that i believe in the devil but if there was a devil i think his
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.040]   principal function would be to convince us that we are so bestial that god couldn't love us
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.080]   it would be to convince us that we're awful and that we should just lean
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:50.880]   into the awfulness and i know the the greatest low points of my life came whenever i just went
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:58.960]   you know what i'm just i'm just awful i might as well just behave awfully and i i really believe
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:12.000]   that when you don't when you push down parts of yourself like your sexuality like your
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.280]   insecurities your your true feelings from your romantic partner the person who's supposed to be
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:26.800]   your you know your number one you are making sure you will never feel their love because they don't
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:33.120]   love you they love the you you've presented to them which you know in your heart is not the
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:40.480]   authentic honest real you and so if you know you're super into furries and you don't tell your
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.960]   partner about that and your partner says i love you so much and you know what i love one of the
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.120]   things i love about us is we have such great sexual chemistry you'll never feel that love
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.560]   because you know yeah that's not true though she doesn't know she doesn't know that actually i'm not
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.080]   really satisfied and there is this thing that i want that i know i can't even tell
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.080]   her because i'm so ashamed like that doesn't feel like a good option to me
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:10.400]   yeah yeah so that kind of vulnerability is essential to intimacy you know i'm not a
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.480]   i'm prone to jiu jitsu metaphors and this is one of the first conversations where i can actually
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.120]   use them because the person i'm talking to is a jiu jitsu person but and people should know that
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:25.680]   you are a quote-unquote jiu jitsu person you have been afflicted with the i am a brown belt under
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   marcella garcia and i am like a seven-year brown belt now so which is the right way to be a brown
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:38.240]   bow well and also i am i am you know late middle-aged middleweight and moderately talented so
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.320]   i'm i'm and training it at that age and i'm not a jiu jitsu person but i'm a jiu jitsu person and i'm
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.160]   academy with so many incredibly talented people and training in new york city where there's so
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.240]   many unbelievably talented people you're you're constantly humble and feeling like you should just
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.640]   be wearing a blue belt all the time um but but a lot of i think as you know and as most most people
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:00.240]   who practice jiu jitsu know you start to sort of see jiu jitsu and everything i genuinely believe
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:08.480]   that in love you have to give something to get something you have to cre everything you do
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.600]   creates a vulnerability
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.800]   you know every every move you make in jiu jitsu creates opportunity and creates vulnerability and
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:22.720]   so you have to be willing to create vulnerabilities in order to get any leverage in order to get any
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.440]   progress in any way to move the position you know you don't want a marriage that's just two people
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.600]   both in 50 50 you know like you're just sitting in that guard doing nothing
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.040]   you know you you you wanna you want it to actually move along
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.440]   yeah i mean that's the way i see love and relationships is you should take that leap
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.040]   of vulnerability give the other person the option to destroy you
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:50.160]   well you have to expose and that's that that's the part that i think is is um hard for everyone
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.640]   you know is is to expose yourself in that way but that's what i mean even when i said about
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:01.440]   getting a dog or having a child like love loving anything is tremendously courageous
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:10.080]   because it's terrifying and and it's only brave if you're scared if you're not scared you know
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:15.920]   it's not brave it's just stupidity it's just you know it's it's it's bravery when you're afraid and
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.000]   you do the thing anyway and so love is like yeah it's scary like it i don't care who you are like
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.120]   i you know being you know in the jiu jitsu community like i'm around you know as you are
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.440]   like incredibly tough people like physically tough people mentally tough people
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:40.000]   but you know i've seen some of those people taken down by a 120 pound woman you know not
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.880]   not not from a grappling perspective but they are taken apart by a woman in their life and and vice
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:53.600]   versa i've seen men you know who like it really is shocking how much leverage we give to our
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:00.720]   romantic partners and how little discussion we really genuine discussion we really have about it
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.240]   how much we really are ever trained to think about it
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.920]   you know there's nothing in school that teaches us about it so much of literature and art
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:16.960]   is an idealized version of it so little of it is is real and no matter how it evolves
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:26.000]   even when it ends in tragedy or uh drama i feel like what people don't do enough is appreciate
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.360]   the good times like appreciate how beautiful it is to having taken the risk and to having
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:39.840]   experienced that kind of love i think when you look at people and that are divorcing each other
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   uh there's a edgar allen poe quote the years of love have been forgot in the hatred of a minute
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:55.040]   i always kind of am saddened like deeply saddened how people seem to forget how many beautiful
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:02.800]   moments have been shared when some reason some drama some breakup leads them to part ways yeah
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.480]   yeah it's interesting that you came to that not being a divorce lawyer
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.760]   because i i've felt that way for a long time and i really
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.160]   i've felt that way for a long time and i really try to say to my clients
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.560]   like in the courtroom at the negotiating table i have a a role to play where i have to be sort
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.000]   of like a pit bull or you know some kind of a like a courtroom sociopath but behind closed doors like
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.560]   i'm very candid with people i'm trying to be much more emotionally attuned with them so you're an
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.960]   empath in the sheets and sociopath in the streets exactly correct that's well said i've been a boy
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:39.680]   that's a i get a new tattoo idea that's good i like that i i but i i do believe when i'm behind
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.920]   closed doors with people i say to them how you end things is going to be how you're going to
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.880]   remember the whole thing and and that's unfortunate because you know you watch like a
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:54.080]   two-hour movie and if the last 15 minutes of it sucked you go well that movie sucked
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.280]   like well the first hour and 45 was great you know but you walk out with this bad taste in your mouth
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:09.600]   i i'm genuinely in awe of how easily people forget that they loved each other and and i'm
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:17.440]   amazed because by the time i meet them and by the time they they hire me to be a weapon against the
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:24.960]   person they were in love with there's nothing but animosity there and so i have to try to imagine
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:30.640]   what these two people looked like when they were in love with each other and how that even existed
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:38.320]   but i have to tell you like i i you know i i don't function that way like i every woman i ever had a
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.520]   relationship with
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:45.760]   like i when i think of them i i don't think of the ending necessarily i think of i try to think about
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.960]   the greatest hits i try to think about the moments that were wonderful where i loved them and they
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:56.480]   loved me and like there was joy and there was connection and i i don't know why you'd choose
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:02.240]   not to you know it's there's that old axiom i don't know who said it that if you don't learn to
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.320]   find joy in the snow you'll have you'll have less joy in your life and precisely the same amount of
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:08.720]   snow
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:16.480]   and i and i genuinely believe like okay the relationship ends this is where it ends we're
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:24.960]   done now i i am making a choice as to how i will remember you and and we do it in relationships
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.040]   like i i always tell people you know if you ever want to see a couple light up if they're ever like
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.160]   the couple at the table that's you know it seems like they got in a fight or something ask them how
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:38.720]   they met and most people when they talk about how they met like the face softens they both in the
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.360]   other person look at the other person and they're like oh my god i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:39.600]   i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'm so sorry
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.080]   at them telling the story gets that look you were talking about before and because they remember
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:50.080]   that thing and how they felt at that moment and when when this person was a choice not a default
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:55.040]   not their automatic plus one but the person they asked to the wedding not the of course you're
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:01.040]   bringing her it's your wife you bring your wife places like it was still hey there's like
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:08.400]   you know three and a half billion women and i'm picking you you know like that that feeling and and
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:15.840]   i don't know when why when a relationship ends you can't do that a lesson i learned when my mother
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.680]   passed away of a very she had a two-year terrible battle with cancer and was on hospice and was
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:28.800]   very very sick and it was a very slow and awful end and i remember one of my worst
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.960]   fears was that this is how i would remember my mother for the rest of my life that i would never
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.200]   be able to think of her that i didn't think of what she had become in the
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.440]   in the last months where she was withered away to nothing in this bed you know
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:51.600]   and i learned over time that memory is very kind that like that faded somehow and that
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.160]   now like when i remember her i remember her healthy and vibrant i remember her laughter i
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.440]   remember positive things some of that is i like to look at photos of that or but some of it is just
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:08.480]   how i think memory works and i i i don't know why we don't apply that to relationships
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:14.000]   and i think part of it is because we have this binary view of relationships that it's either
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.840]   success which means you live happily ever after for the rest of your lives and die together
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:26.560]   or like in short succession or it was wrong it was awful and i i don't understand why that would
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:32.080]   have to be how we do it i think we could look at relationships like what they are which is chapters
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:39.040]   in a book and that book is our life and those chapters all have
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.800]   significance and none of them would the later chapters none of them would happen without the
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.080]   prior ones so there's this beauty to me of that and it's i don't know if that it's a choice
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:57.360]   or if that is how it is and the rest is just narrative that we've put on top of it culturally
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.760]   for some reason well i think to push back a little bit i think memory
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:08.960]   can also i think it is a deliberate choice because i think memory can basically that's a
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:15.440]   trauma works it can surface the negative stuff and the the negative stuff completely drowns out
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.840]   all the positives so it's i think uh it's a deliberate choice to make your memory probably
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:28.720]   work that way you know in relationships betrayal can do that right sort of uh cheating infidelity
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:38.880]   like one event can almost erase the entirety of your uh understanding of the past and all the
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:44.560]   memories are sort of shrouded in this darkness of okay this what i believed was true is totally
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:51.280]   untrue and sort of to overcome that and still appreciate the beautiful moments i'm continually
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:41:02.400]   astounded by how long the hurt and anger of betrayal can reverberate
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:08.800]   i i have clients who were four years five years past when the divorce
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.680]   ended the cheating was discovered and they're as angry as they were the day they found out
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:22.000]   and and i i don't know what that's about yeah because i also have clients that
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.200]   they like look back on it and they go you know we screwed up like we were you know we didn't
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.640]   do the best but we did the best we could do at the time and you know we like there should be
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.720]   stars for wars like ours you know like there should be champagne in the water
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.360]   for the survivors yeah that's beautiful like we made it through you know like we survived it and
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.680]   we were fools and we were fools for love and there are worse things in the world to be fools for
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:53.040]   but i i also do think that most relationships where there was infidelity
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:00.160]   and it's not a it's not a popular thing to say and i'll get i'll get pilloried for it but great
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:07.520]   you know i just don't know and i don't want to blame the victim of infidelity
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:15.440]   but was the relationship really where it needed to be like had were you truly the most just
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:22.160]   dutiful spouse who was seeing this person's needs be met again we've established in the granola story
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.280]   that people can sometimes with good intentions not be meeting their partner's needs or perceiving
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.120]   their partner's needs or their partner isn't communicating them the right way or all of the
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:38.560]   above but i i've rarely seen very happy content couples that choose to be in a relationship with
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.520]   cheat on each other.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.700]   And so I understand there's a shame
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.740]   in saying this person cheated on me,
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.400]   or I cheated on this person.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.220]   'Cause I represent, you know, I represent,
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.280]   I represent the cheater and I represent the cheated.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.620]   I represent the victim of domestic violence.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.400]   I represent the perpetrator of domestic violence.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.440]   I represent the person with the substance use disorder,
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.660]   the person married to the person.
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.260]   So I don't get to choose the white or the black hat.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.440]   Like I have my client and that's my client.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.800]   And it forces me to put myself into their story
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.420]   from their point of view.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.200]   And I think that kind of radical empathy
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.960]   that you need to engage in on a daily basis
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.500]   to represent people in those kinds of proceedings,
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.360]   it just, I don't know, it just doesn't seem like
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.440]   there's good guys and bad guys, you know?
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.100]   It just seems like it's complicated
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.540]   and people's intentions
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.440]   and where they actually end up are different.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.740]   - Yeah, I think there's some sense in
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:42.800]   still remembering the betrayal as it being a symptom
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.960]   of taking life a little too seriously.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.460]   Too seriously where you don't,
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.300]   life shouldn't be taken that seriously.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.720]   You should be able to laugh at it all.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.400]   I like the story you say of, you know,
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.300]   being able to appreciate the battle
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.440]   that should give stars for those kind of wars
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.440]   that we fought and just kind of be able to laugh at it all.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.480]   - Especially with love.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.420]   Like love's just so absurd. - Yeah.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.760]   - Like it's so-- - It's just crazy.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.840]   - It's so crazy.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.780]   I mean, like I don't, you know, I think it's funny.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.680]   I think, I mean, this is real candor, but you know,
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.860]   as a man, like there's nothing funnier
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.860]   than when you finish masturbating, you know?
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.640]   There's no more humbling moment.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.980]   And I like to think about the fact that like the richest,
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.820]   famous, most powerful person in the world, they jerk off.
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.900]   You know, the most powerful man in the world jerks off,
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.480]   I'm sure, you know, all of them do.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.680]   I mean, you probably know them, so you could ask, but.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.860]   And that moment where you just, you know, you're like,
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:34.420]   - Yeah. - You're like, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.380]   You come and you go, what am I doing?
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.300]   Like what the, now I gotta wipe that, like, oh, good Lord.
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.800]   And there's this feeling of, but a second ago,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.180]   this seemed like a great idea.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:47.060]   And it was, by the way, it was a great idea.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:51.040]   But there's this moment, this satori, you know,
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.780]   where you just go, oh, like what, this is so silly.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.740]   Well, like that's love, that's sex.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:57.580]   Like it's crazy.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.380]   Like when you read other people's infidelity,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.420]   the text messages, the emails,
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.080]   'cause I have to do that all the time.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.960]   And I'll tell you how we make the sausage.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.500]   In a divorce lawyer's office,
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.020]   this is some of the most entertaining moments
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.440]   is dramatic readings aloud of people's infidelity exchanges
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.440]   with their lovers.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.280]   The sexts.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.780]   Yeah, the sexts and the like, you know,
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.580]   like it's just so ridiculous.
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.220]   'Cause people have to go through like all kinds of gymnastics
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.900]   to be able to meet and have sex in weird places.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.220]   And, you know, and you're reading this
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.720]   and you're reading these texts and you kind of go like,
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.960]   oh my God, these people.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.500]   And by the way, like I've represented
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.600]   some very powerful people.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.580]   And you read their texts with their lover
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.220]   or even their spouse, like even their spouse, you know,
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.540]   and they're just pathetic.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.020]   I mean, they're just like so not powerful.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.360]   They're so like, hey babe, you know.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.580]   I have a, I have a, will remain totally nameless.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:00.580]   I have a very powerful, wealthy, famous former client
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.780]   where there's a whole series of texts about,
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:03.720]   is my dick weird?
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.260]   Which by the way, I think the answer is,
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.800]   is if you have to ask if you have a weird dick,
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.940]   the answer's probably yes.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.640]   'Cause I own one and I've never thought, is this weird?
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.280]   But I, the fact that you're having this discussion,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   like it's absurd.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.120]   It's hilarious.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.160]   Like love is hilarious.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.000]   It's bizarre.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.480]   It's such a weird vulnerability.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.260]   It's such a basic visceral human need.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.540]   You know, it really is something that we just, you know,
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.040]   it's mysterious.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.180]   It, but it, but it doesn't have to be that complicated.
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.860]   I don't think that even betrayal, like I said,
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.040]   it doesn't have to be that complicated.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.160]   I think we can frame it differently.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.260]   - Yeah, you can laugh at the whole thing.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:48.300]   I mean, I think what we don't often do with ourselves
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.220]   is look back at texts or look back at emails
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.800]   or look back at Google search.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.020]   I did that recently.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.160]   Just looking at what I searched for like 10 years ago, 15.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.160]   It's like, forget last week, just look at your Google search.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.880]   - Yeah.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.080]   - Google searches last week.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.260]   And you're like, wait a minute.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.320]   What?
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.500]   Why did you just search for this 50 times?
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.340]   - Right.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.500]   - Like, why did the Karate Kid 3 pop in your head?
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.340]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.180]   Why?
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.320]   And like, you're like, where's Ralph Macchio now?
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.160]   And where did-
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.000]   - Who is he dating?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.680]   - And then mother and then you're like-
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.620]   - And then a restaurant nearby.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.780]   Like, how did I go from this to that?
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.440]   But it made sense at the time.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.860]   So when you ask someone,
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.100]   how did our relationship fall apart?
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.380]   It's like looking at the Google search history
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.700]   of yourself from 10 years.
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.280]   You don't even know why you were thinking about those things.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.520]   And now you wanna understand why you did what you did,
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   felt what you felt, she felt what she felt,
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.940]   she did what she did, and why the two of you,
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.620]   how you impacted each other and interacted with each other.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.560]   Really?
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.640]   You think that's doable?
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.320]   - But you've, so you've, in the courtroom,
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.560]   does that come up?
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.400]   - Yeah.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.320]   - You know, you've got sex messages with,
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.520]   that resulted in, with whoever you're cheating with.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.360]   So you have to-
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.820]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, cheating doesn't come up as much
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.740]   because most states are no fault states now.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.280]   So why someone's getting divorced,
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.860]   whether it's infidelity or, you know, it doesn't matter.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.260]   There's no good spouse bonus or bad spouse penalty.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.100]   - Oh, there isn't.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:20.940]   I mean, can you elaborate on that?
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:21.780]   Like that's-
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:22.740]   - Well, you can have,
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.460]   we've had times where we have to prove infidelity
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.060]   because we wanna prove what's called
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.820]   wasteful dissipation of marital assets,
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.940]   which means that you were spending money
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.400]   that was marital money.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.240]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.400]   - On a paramour.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.420]   That's what the legal name for an ex, you know,
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.620]   for a boyfriend or girlfriend in the marriage.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.380]   And usually the person calls it, you know, that whore.
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.640]   Or that piece of shit.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.480]   But we call them paramour.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.320]   - It rhymes.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.160]   - Yeah, the paramour.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:46.980]   - Yeah.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.160]   - And the, you know, sometimes we have to prove
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.560]   inclination and opportunity.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.800]   We have to prove that this person had the inclination
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.940]   to cheat and that they had the opportunity to cheat.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.500]   And then we wanna show that, okay, so when they went away,
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:00.560]   that should be considered dissipation of marital assets.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.240]   So if you go out to dinner with your brother
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.940]   you didn't dissipate the marital estate.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.280]   But if you bought your paramour a Tiffany bracelet,
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.900]   that would be a dissipation of marital assets
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.060]   and the person's entitled to a credit back for that
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.780]   from what was taken out of the marital estate.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.360]   So we do sometimes have to authenticate text messages
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.680]   on the witness stand or in depositions, you know.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.600]   And what's interesting about that
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.040]   is the way people approach it.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:26.000]   Like people sometimes try to pretend,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.580]   "Oh no, this is just my good friend."
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.420]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.080]   - You know, which is just like you kill your credibility.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.020]   You know, if you, "Oh no, she's just my very good friend."
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.300]   She's not, she's not.
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.380]   That makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.880]   Or, "No, we were just friends at that point."
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.160]   And then several months later is when we,
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.600]   once this marriage was over,
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.360]   that's when we got together as partner.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.200]   - Right. - That's ridiculous.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.140]   But sometimes people just own it, just own it.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.260]   Like I did a deposition of an executive once
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.620]   and, you know, opposing counsel,
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.180]   like thought they were gonna really hit him.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.580]   They were like, "And looking at this credit card receipt,
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.380]   what was this charge for, for this hotel?"
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:01.920]   He's like, "Oh, that was, you know,
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.680]   that was for a hotel room that I got with my girlfriend."
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.520]   And you were married.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.360]   Yes, yes.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.700]   What did you, where did you stay at the hotel?
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:09.680]   It was, we didn't even stay.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.280]   We actually just did like an afternoon delight,
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.880]   rolled around in bed for the day.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.040]   - Yeah.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.420]   - And it was like, well now, you know,
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.980]   took all the thunder out of that.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.220]   - What's the downside of doing that?
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.060]   That seems like a really-
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:20.900]   - There wasn't.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.980]   It actually, I think, helped his credibility.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.900]   It was my client, so I thought it was the right move.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.460]   We hadn't really discussed it in advance,
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.780]   but he was naturally intelligent enough to go,
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.760]   "Yeah, my credibility, like I'm not gonna lie under oath.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.720]   I'll admit what it was, but I'll do it in such an,"
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.920]   you know, we did it like at the end,
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.960]   like Eminem at the end of "8 Mile."
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.540]   Like it was very like, "Yeah, I cheated on her
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.580]   with this person.
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.800]   Now tell these people something they don't know about me."
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.640]   You know?
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:50.640]   And that's kind of how I try to, as a trial lawyer,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.640]   we actually, in my firm, refer to it
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.940]   as the "8 Mile strategy," which is like,
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:59.140]   we will, if I know there was a text message sent,
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.600]   you know, "You piece of shit, I hope you die."
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.980]   My client sent that text message to his co-parent.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:09.980]   On my examination of my client, I will say,
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.960]   I'd like to have this marked for identification,
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.900]   shown to the witness, "What is that?"
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:15.980]   It's a text message.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.320]   "Who's it to?"
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.840]   "A plaintiff."
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.740]   "You sent it?"
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.560]   "Yeah."
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.720]   "Read it out loud for the court."
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.220]   "Do I have to?"
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.940]   "I think you should."
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.440]   "You're a piece of S?"
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.780]   "Does it say S?"
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.340]   "No."
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.180]   "What does it say?"
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.100]   "Well, it's a profanity."
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.100]   "Say it, say it."
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.440]   "You piece of shit, I hope that you die."
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.280]   "Yeah."
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.120]   "You sent that to her?"
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:42.960]   "Yes."
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.800]   "Why?"
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.820]   "I was really mad."
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.760]   "Do you think that was good?"
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.580]   "No."
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.420]   "Do you think it was helpful
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.500]   for your co-parenting relationship with her?"
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.340]   "No."
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:54.200]   "Why did you send it then?"
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.360]   "You know, she sent me like 50 texts exactly like that,
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.400]   and I never responded, and I pushed it down every time,
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.280]   and then finally,
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   I just blew up at her.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.200]   If you had it to do over again,
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.620]   would you do it differently?
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.300]   You know, I wish I could say I would,
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.560]   but the truth is, I'm human, and I was at my limits,
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.460]   and I'm watching opposing counsel
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.480]   cross out entire sheets of their cross-examination,
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.660]   'cause it's gone now.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:20.440]   They thought that they had their like Perry Mason moment.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.280]   They had their like,
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.080]   "Did you order the code red?" moment, and it's gone now.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.600]   Because if you just own and accept your fault
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.120]   or your issues in the relationship,
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.620]   you can take a lot of the power out of that.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.620]   - And I wish we wouldn't take texts seriously.
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:38.500]   - I don't think we should have
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.380]   substantive discussions via text.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.280]   I think text was designed for,
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.200]   "Are you here?
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.200]   Yes.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.800]   15 minutes away."
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.540]   Or, "I got here safely.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.380]   Love you."
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.560]   Like that substantive discussions.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.920]   People love having arguments via text.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.760]   And I have to say,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.680]   when you read other people's text messages,
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.220]   as I am often forced to do,
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.680]   it is amazing
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   'cause just like that Google history you were talking about,
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:08.040]   I don't know how the hell you got from one thing to another.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.260]   Like I was just reading,
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.300]   actually on the way here in the car,
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.600]   I was reading through a text exchange
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.280]   between two co-parents in the middle of a custody thing
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.380]   that I'm involved in.
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:23.260]   And it's like, "You piece of shit.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.660]   You never cared about anything.
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.500]   And I'm gonna take,
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.660]   you have no right to take the kids from me."
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.320]   And then the next day, nothing in between.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.520]   The next day,
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.920]   Maddie got a good grade on her science thing.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.760]   "Oh, that's great.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.700]   She's doing so well.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.720]   It makes me so happy.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.880]   Yeah, her teacher said she's doing really well.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.340]   Yeah, that's really great to see.
[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:43.940]   I'll be there about 15 minutes late.
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.780]   No problem.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.620]   See you then."
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.960]   Wait, like it was a day ago.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.480]   I wanna know,
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.340]   was there a phone conversation in between
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.180]   where one of you went,
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.520]   "Hey man, listen, I'm really sorry about that.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.500]   Oh no, look, we were both pissed, whatever."
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.140]   Or is it just like you did that
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.160]   and then we're supposed to pretend that didn't happen?
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.680]   And now we're just gonna talk about
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.100]   what Maddie got on her test.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.600]   - Yeah, well, sometimes a good nap
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.520]   or a good night's sleep
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.120]   can solve a lot of emotional issues.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.540]   - I totally get it.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.980]   But is there some,
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.740]   if you're looking just at the texts,
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.680]   like it begs the question,
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.200]   wouldn't you take the nap and then go,
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.820]   "Hey, listen, I just woke up from the nap.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:19.960]   It turns out I was really tired."
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.880]   Like, does that not happen by text?
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.720]   - Oh no, that's,
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.760]   'cause sometimes it's hard to probably apologize
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.260]   for being an asshole, right?
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.940]   So I think we use just texts.
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.000]   We humans use,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.900]   all kinds of forms of communication to kind of vent.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.720]   I think it's the wrong thing to do,
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.720]   but people do do that.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.220]   - Text has a permanence though, it's writing.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.060]   I mean, it's writing.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.440]   You think like a lawyer.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.280]   I like it.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.120]   - I do think like a lawyer,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.480]   but lawyers think like detail, you know?
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.020]   And why would you write that down?
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:53.860]   Like, you know, writing it down,
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.020]   like would you write it down
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:57.620]   and would you put it on a billboard in Times Square?
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.840]   'Cause like that's, everything you say on Facebook,
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:00.680]   or Instagram,
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.380]   can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.020]   Like every photo you post,
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.120]   I mean, that's going on with,
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.460]   what's his name, Jake Paul or whatever,
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.280]   Paul and Dylan Dannis right now.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.860]   That guy's girlfriend,
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.780]   every picture that's ever been put on the internet
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.400]   of her, by her, is being weaponized right now.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.300]   - To reference an earlier part of our discussion,
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.320]   that's love, you take a big risks,
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.020]   big risk putting it out there.
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:25.860]   - Yeah.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:28.140]   - Putting it out there on text,
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.680]   putting it out there on social media.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.520]   - Yeah.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:35.520]   - But is the reward of doing it via text worthwhile?
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.420]   Listen, the reward of love,
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.680]   I think is worth the risks of love,
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.860]   but the benefit of communicating by text,
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:49.860]   does it merit that risk of that being in writing
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:54.480]   that the person can reflect on and review and scroll back
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.300]   and get heated up again about?
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.740]   - I don't know, we just take risks
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.520]   and we're vulnerable with each other.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.220]   There may be something about text
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:07.720]   that for whatever reasons inspires a kind of candor,
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:12.640]   because I think it is a new way to communicate, right?
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.480]   - Yeah.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.620]   - In the scheme of things.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.760]   And so sometimes, you know, we don't know the thing
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.860]   until it's really come into existence.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:23.660]   So I don't know, I think it started as something
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.860]   that we just communicated in a very extemporaneous,
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.360]   unplanned way, like texts were meant to be.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.700]   I'm here, I'm outside, whatever it might be.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:37.560]   And so what happens when you start to talk about
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.200]   more emotional, deeper, bigger things, or visceral things,
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.060]   or more emphatic, passionate things,
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.660]   using a technology that was originally
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.280]   just being used for that purpose?
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.520]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.780]   What I do know is, yeah, as a lawyer,
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:56.100]   A, from an evidentiary perspective,
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:59.200]   and B, I just know what it looks like on the outside,
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   like I know when I read it, what it looks like.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:08.120]   And that's not always accurate.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.660]   Like to just see the, it's like when you watch, you know,
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.780]   a video of someone at just their worst moment, you know,
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.780]   and the person tries to say, but wait, that's not me.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.500]   Like that was just me in that moment.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.620]   That was me at this incredible low point.
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:25.620]   And I think as a lawyer, my job is to weaponize that
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:29.040]   and to try to say, okay, this low point is indicative of who they are.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:29.880]   - Yeah.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.240]   - And when I'm defending someone, I'm not,
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.200]   I'm supposed to say, you know, well, this is their low point.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.580]   And we've all been to a low point.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.080]   And this is just a moment in this person.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.700]   And to judge them by that moment,
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.920]   would you want to be judged by your worst moment?
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.580]   So I have to be able to look at that both directions.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:46.000]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't think anyone looks great on text.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.700]   - I mean, there's so much of our communication
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.380]   that is missing, you know, your expression.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.200]   Like my sense of humor does not do well via text.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.880]   Like I, 'cause I have like sometimes a sarcastic sense of humor.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.220]   Or I have a dry sense of humor.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.000]   And it does not always translate well to text.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.540]   The nuance of things is lost sometimes, you know.
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:11.640]   - Yeah, but that's what makes the risk of it hilarious.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.760]   I mean, the emojis, the memes, all that.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.460]   Taking a risk, the dry, there's a risk with the text.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:22.460]   If you do some like dark, dry statement, right?
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.680]   That's a joke.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.500]   And then the pause,
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.300]   and then there's no response for a couple hours.
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.720]   I mean, that's beautiful.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.380]   I don't know, that's a, that's a--
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.020]   - It's like a, it's the, you know,
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.840]   it's the gap between the two trapezes, you know?
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.800]   Like once you've hit send and you're like,
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.640]   "Well, let's see where this goes."
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:42.340]   Like, "This is coming back now," you know?
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.800]   And you're waiting and waiting.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.260]   It's like that moment of just hang is, yeah, that's a rush.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.100]   I mean, that's a rush.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.100]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:52.140]   - Well, I have my friend, Michael Malice, living close by.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:56.020]   And if the courtroom were ever to see the text between us,
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.560]   I would, we would be both in jail.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.400]   - Okay.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.480]   - For many, many years.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.640]   - The subpoena, yeah, when this finally comes out,
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.480]   when I have my Johnny Depp Amber Heard moment,
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.760]   I'll get Michael Malice.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.860]   - Well, but that was one of, you know,
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:13.320]   the Johnny Depp Amber Heard thing was a great example of,
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.720]   in a gunfight between those two,
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.220]   everyone was cheering for the bullets.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.760]   I mean, no one was,
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.180]   I don't think anybody looked like a hero.
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:22.980]   They both looked like what they are, which is humans.
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:26.800]   Really flawed humans who had, you know,
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.400]   it really is like that, that People magazine,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.740]   things stars, they're just like us, you know,
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.440]   like we watched that and went like,
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:33.700]   "Oh yeah, they're just like us."
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.780]   Like they cannot keep it together.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.240]   They cannot have, like,
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.780]   they just have these ridiculous toxic moments
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.640]   where both of them look awful in that trial.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.400]   - Well, what do you take away from that trial?
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.240]   Just, just given, given all the work you've done.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.900]   I mean, for me, I don't know if you can speak to that.
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:53.240]   It's probably the first time I've seen that kind of,
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:58.240]   a complicated relationship.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.540]   Even just to say a relationship laid out in this raw form.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.360]   - Yeah.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.540]   - Like the fights of a relationship.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.480]   - Yeah.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:10.480]   - My feeling about that trial is there is no amount of money
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.240]   that would be worth laying that kind of stuff bare publicly.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   - For you, if you were dying to-
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.080]   - For me, yeah.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080]   - There's no amount of money.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:17.900]   - I don't know which.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.440]   - Because they both look awful.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.280]   - They both look awful.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.000]   And I don't think, I don't think I'm qualified to say
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.580]   if one or both of them are awful,
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.080]   but they both had moments in that courtroom
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   where their behavior and words looked awful.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.120]   And, and I just don't know that,
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.620]   that exposing that to the world, like the,
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.460]   I just don't know.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.620]   I mean, I understand the point of view that,
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.880]   that by bringing that suit, Johnny Depp was saying,
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.700]   look, I, yeah, I have to show these awful things
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.320]   to the world about myself,
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.620]   but it's, it's not as bad as what she's claimed I've done.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.460]   So I get it.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.380]   I'm not saying that's incorrect.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.000]   And for Amber Heard, I think her response is,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.920]   well, for him to say,
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.580]   I'm lying, you know, I have to prove my,
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.760]   but my God, like what an awful thing to watch.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.960]   I, it was all it really is, is just another,
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.680]   it's just another couple.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.880]   Like, well, there's so, you know how banal that is?
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.720]   You know, many of those-
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.300]   - So this kind of stuff happens a lot?
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.540]   - A lot.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.380]   It's the norm.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.460]   It's not, it's not the exception.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.580]   They just happen to have like a grand scale
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.380]   'cause they have, you know, lots of people around them
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.620]   and lots of money.
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.040]   But yeah, it's all this, that kind of dysfunction,
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:27.760]   that kind of chaos.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.720]   That kind of he said, she said,
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.960]   two people with completely differing histories
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.380]   of what happened in the marriage,
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.520]   false allegations of domestic violence
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.340]   or true allegations of domestic violence
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.180]   that are completely denied by the person.
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.260]   And you have witnesses that'll say,
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.260]   oh my God, they never engaged in any kind of,
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:46.140]   'cause again, no one engages in domestic violence
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.800]   with company over.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.180]   You know, you don't like invite friends.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.760]   Like people always say like, oh no, I saw them.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.760]   They seem so happy.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.100]   Like people always do this to me as a divorce lawyer.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.460]   They come in and they go, well, here's photos of the kids,
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.600]   you know, smiling with you.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.980]   They're smiling with me.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.900]   So that's proof that like, I'm a good dad.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.720]   And I'm like, there's photos of Jeffrey Dahmer
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.140]   smiling with people he ate later.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.760]   And you think these photos prove something?
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.020]   Like I don't, the lack of,
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.980]   I'm in the middle of a very complex domestic violence trial
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.600]   and the entire defense on the other side is,
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.720]   well, we have photos of them on vacation
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.180]   where they look very happy and she never called the cops.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.900]   That's no defense at all.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.900]   Like most victims of intimate partner abuse
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.440]   don't call the cops.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.900]   They identify, self-identify as victims of domestic violence.
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.740]   - And they probably have many stretches of time
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.980]   of intense happiness or happiness.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.820]   - Of course.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.360]   And by the way, perpetrators of domestic violence
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.780]   are charismatic.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.600]   How else would they get victims?
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.900]   You know, it's not like if they were ogre-ish,
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.140]   no one would sign on for that relationship.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.820]   It's that when they're good, they're so good.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.440]   That when they're bad, you go, but wait, no, that's not him.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.280]   The really good person's him or her.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.120]   We saw that in the public testimony of that,
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.780]   you know, Deb Hurd thing is,
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.480]   there were moments where you look at her and go,
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.860]   oh my God, like I want one just like that.
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.520]   And there were moments where you listen to the testimony
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.860]   and go, oh my God, she's awful.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.900]   Like what, that's just evil.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.740]   - Yeah.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.580]   - And the same for him.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.580]   So I really, this should teach us something about
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:23.660]   how not only are there two sides to every story,
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.120]   like that there's just so much complexity and nuance.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.740]   But I think everyone was asking the question,
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.120]   whether you were team Deb, team Hurd, or team,
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.320]   I could care less about either of these people.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.820]   Everybody's looking at it going, why?
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.200]   Like why, 8 billion people in the world.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.500]   Why did you stay together?
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.740]   Just break up, you're miserable.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.700]   It's obvious.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.960]   It's obvious you're not, this can't be worth it.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.740]   - I've actually become friendly with Camille Vasquez,
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.500]   who's the lawyer on the Deb side.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.920]   She's an incredible woman.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.920]   - Great lawyer.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.660]   - And just a great human being.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.960]   Just how passionate she is about
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.800]   her work.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.000]   I mean, you radiate this kind of same passion.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.460]   Like she's just truly happy doing what she does.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.300]   - Yeah.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:08.300]   - And, but also where the stress of a case is like takes,
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.920]   like it is becomes her.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.000]   She's, you can't sleep, all this kind of stuff,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.080]   which is fascinating.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.380]   - That's, I think that's a function of our professions.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:21.500]   We, even after 20 plus years of doing this,
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.540]   like the night before a trial, I can hardly sleep.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.380]   And I-
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.220]   - Excitement, fear.
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:26.800]   - Yes.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.640]   - Okay.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.840]   - All of that, all of that.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.460]   And I even have moments as I pull up to the courthouse
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.640]   and I listen, I wear certain cuff links
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.100]   that are like my lucky cuff links or something.
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.920]   And I pull up to the courthouse,
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.000]   I walk into the courtroom and I have this feeling
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.300]   in the pit of my stomach.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.220]   And then it starts.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:50.300]   And the moment it starts, something in me goes,
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.040]   "Oh yeah, I know how to do this."
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:52.880]   - Yeah.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.420]   - And it's instantly, like I just, I own it.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.640]   I love it.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.880]   And it's, yeah, it's the people that love this job,
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.980]   you know, being a trial lawyer,
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.340]   being a particularly a divorce trial lawyer,
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.260]   family law trial lawyer.
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.400]   It's, I love it.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.880]   I love it more than I loved it when I started doing it.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.880]   I still, you know, I can't imagine spending five days a week
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.520]   looking forward to two, you know, I love what I do.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:21.640]   I don't know that I'll ever love anyone or anything more
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.180]   than I love the work.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.400]   - I saw you on, talk with Steve Harvey a bunch of times
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.020]   and it was, I always loved it.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.600]   One thing just sticks in my head from something he said
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   as advice that if you and your partner, your spouse are,
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.780]   you know, if there's a fight,
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.860]   there's a difficult thing you have to deal with,
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.900]   keep that to yourself.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.180]   Don't talk to anyone else.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.440]   Like that's a little, like, what does he say?
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.360]   Like a two arm circle or something,
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.520]   whatever the expression is,
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.280]   but basically resolve it all internally.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.320]   Don't,
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.660]   like when you face the world,
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.280]   you have a front of like,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.860]   - Don't take sides against the family.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.700]   - Yeah.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.620]   Yes.
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.900]   - Like it all boils down to Godfather.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.020]   - It all, everything boils down to Godfather references.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:09.860]   It really does.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.700]   - And true romance.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.520]   - Yeah, you don't take sides against the family.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.900]   You don't, you don't,
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.200]   you don't show that weakness to the world.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.400]   I mean, again, I don't know that,
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.940]   I don't know that Steve in candor would say
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.780]   you shouldn't discuss it with your own therapist, you know?
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.160]   But I think what he's saying is don't project it.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.240]   Don't project it out to the world.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.080]   Don't share that because I think, you know,
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.540]   it will, it can change the way people view your relationship,
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:38.080]   which then will change the way you view your relationship,
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.920]   you know?
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:42.780]   And, and so I think don't run reckless
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:47.160]   when it comes to your, that primary relationship.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.920]   Don't run your mouth recklessly.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.960]   - Yeah, it's one of the things I mentioned to you offline
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.000]   that, you know, my now close friend, Joe Rogan,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   I've never heard him ever speak negatively of his wife.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.380]   It's always like super positive how awesome of a person she is.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.120]   And that to me has always been an inspiration
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.700]   to do the same for everybody in my life,
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.760]   to always speak positively about them.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.760]   So that has a probably a virtuous spiral effect.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.840]   - I'm sure.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.500]   Like I, that's, that's probably because he has a great wife
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.120]   and he has a great wife in part because of that.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.960]   - Yeah.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.840]   - Like I, I think it's clear that he's in her corner.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.840]   And cheering for her.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.600]   It's clear she's cheering for him.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.340]   Like they, they have, it's not like Joe Rogan's not a man
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.720]   who has opportunity.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.340]   I mean, he's surrounded by UFC ring girls for God's sakes.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.340]   Like this is a guy who has all the opportunity in the world.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.760]   And he seems to be quite a fan of his wife.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.220]   And that is, you know, that's a superpower.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:43.500]   Like that's a real thing.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.000]   Now the question is, is, you know,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.840]   he doesn't seem to talk about it.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.960]   Like, oh, I gotta really work at that.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.800]   - Yeah.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.340]   - You know, and that's not a man who's afraid to talk
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.720]   about what he works at.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.680]   You know, he's pretty honest about it.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.800]   He's honest about, man, yeah,
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   I gotta work really hard to stay in show.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.300]   I gotta work really hard to be able to do this.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.980]   Like, yeah, I'm not good at memorizing that.
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.800]   It takes time.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.640]   - Yeah.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.720]   - But I've never heard him say like,
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.220]   oh, marriage is a lot of work.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.720]   Like, and I think that's to his credit.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.100]   Because it seems like they're enjoying that.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.220]   And it's also not incredibly public.
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.100]   Like it's not something,
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.980]   most people couldn't pick her out of a lineup.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:19.720]   - He kept it private for many years.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.220]   And just because it's a private joy,
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.520]   it's a private, like deep, meaningful, intimate partnership.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.360]   - That's interesting.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.180]   That's also an inspiration.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.440]   It doesn't, not everything about your life has to be this,
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.400]   like, look at me, I'm happy.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.320]   Like, I'm in a happy relationship.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.440]   Everything is wonderful.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440]   - Especially that.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.140]   I think there is something about the womb-like,
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:46.140]   cocoon-like joy, you know, of like love.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.400]   You know, when you're just tucked in,
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.180]   snuggled in, like just pressed against each other with that.
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.360]   Like that's such a, you know,
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.240]   like a, it's just the two of you.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.740]   And that's lovely, you know?
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.660]   And that's such a good thing.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.740]   And I, like, we were just dying for connection, you know?
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.240]   And that connection is so big.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.740]   It's so everything, you know?
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.280]   One of my earliest psychedelic experiences,
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.480]   probably when I was a teenager,
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.160]   but a theme that's been persistent
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.060]   in every psychedelic experience I've ever had,
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.440]   is this idea of like, everything is connection.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.120]   Everything is,
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.200]   being pressed to someone and with them, you know?
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.120]   Like the warmth of human connection.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.860]   Like I, one of the reasons I enjoy listening to your work
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:38.860]   and your perspective has always been that I think at the core,
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:41.580]   you see connection and love.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.580]   And I think for me,
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:48.860]   from my earliest experiences with psychedelics
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:51.200]   at, you know, 16, 17,
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.320]   I was very attuned to that.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.040]   I was very,
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.340]   very much, that was put on my radar by psychedelics
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:02.880]   and just stayed part of my consciousness forever.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.960]   And I think I had a 30 something year break from psychedelics,
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.700]   but it was like, when I came back to it, I went,
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.880]   "Oh yeah, it's still there."
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.540]   That's still the core of everything, is connection.
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.380]   - I mean, it's fascinating how deeply you value connection,
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.420]   how empathic you are,
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.000]   that you would be doing what you're doing,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.080]   which is, or is it not?
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.880]   It's not counterintuitive. - I think it's the opposite.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.500]   I think it's actually why I'm well-suited for what I do.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:33.500]   I think what I do is I have to learn the story of my client
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.220]   and know it and feel it very deeply.
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.760]   And I have to feel it in a very human way
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.540]   that's very compassionate to this person.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.640]   And then I have to feel it and understand it in a way
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.840]   that's incredibly antagonistic to it
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.180]   so I can shore up defenses.
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.720]   So I have to feel this person,
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.720]   this person's story and feelings from every possible angle,
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   because every one of them is a vulnerability
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.560]   and every one of them is a potential strength
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.020]   and a potential defense.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:09.100]   And so I actually think it's my number one,
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.060]   other than extemporaneous speaking ability,
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:15.560]   it is my number one job tool,
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.880]   is the ability to radically empathize
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.680]   and to put myself in the emotional state of someone
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.560]   in its best possible light,
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.220]   worst possible light,
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.400]   so that I can see again, the defense
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.100]   and I can see the vulnerability.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.860]   - But I mean, so that's beautifully put,
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:37.720]   but also just to bear witness to this connection broken
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.800]   in those dramatic way over and over and over and over.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.180]   - That part is hard,
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:46.940]   but I was a hospice volunteer for many, many years
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.680]   when I first got out of college.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.900]   And it really showed me a lot about
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   what is sadness, what is tragic,
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.200]   and what is just inevitable decay?
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.940]   What is pain and decay?
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:06.820]   Like we all die.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.240]   Like we play a game you can't win to the utmost.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.520]   And so if we know the answer to all of this is
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.640]   you're going to die,
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.240]   then what do we do with the rest of that time?
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.320]   If all your stuff is just stuff,
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.360]   it's just gonna go to the,
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.440]   the money's gonna go,
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.280]   like everything's, your looks is gonna go,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.240]   everything's gonna go.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.120]   Love's gonna end one way or the other.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.860]   Then what are we doing?
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.160]   And again, I think it's love and connection,
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:35.040]   but what I'm doing for a living is helping.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.000]   I don't look at it as what I'm doing
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.480]   is helping people beat the crap out of each other.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.620]   I look at it as I'm trying to help a client
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:46.160]   build their post-divorce life,
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.940]   to sort of rise from the ashes of that,
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:51.700]   which has fallen apart and move on to the next chapter
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.080]   and refocus and have the things they need
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.080]   financially, emotionally, whatever it might be,
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.080]   interpersonally in terms of with their kids.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.040]   And so for me, it's actually a job that is very consistent
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:05.960]   with my desire to build connection and to be empathetic.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.280]   - And witnessing the ashes doesn't make you cynical
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.280]   about the whole thing of love.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.780]   - No, because again, you know,
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.080]   56% of marriages end in divorce,
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.420]   but 84% are remarried within five years.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.540]   Like we keep doing it over and over again.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.460]   - And that's a good thing.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.920]   That's a- - I think it is a good thing.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.340]   The mess of it, the absurdity of it, the hypocrisy of it,
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.000]   that's something beautiful about that.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.580]   - Well, it's just the return is so great on the investment.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:37.160]   You know, like the, listen, man, I've had more than one dog.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.000]   - Yeah.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.080]   - Like when my dog died, the first dog I had died,
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.340]   I remember when I'm never gonna love again.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.380]   I'm done. I'm done with this.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:50.180]   I will never expose myself to this kind of pain again.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:53.760]   I'll never have to take the dog bed and put it in the closet
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.180]   and like, ugh.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:01.420]   And then some friend called me and said,
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.640]   we have an adoption event.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.920]   Can you just watch this dog for 24 hours
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.760]   and then we'll take him?
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.520]   You know, we just need to, you know, and I went,
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.520]   yeah, all right, I'll watch a dog for the night,
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.340]   you know, and this dog come and they say, oh, he has mange.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.600]   He's not gonna, fuck, I got another dog.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.640]   He walked in, my heart went, yeah, I got a dog.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   And now that dog is 13 years old and his eyes are cloudy
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.900]   and he doesn't go up the stairs real well
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.520]   and he's gonna break my heart.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.300]   And I wouldn't change that for the world.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.760]   - I'm still there.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.360]   I'm still struggling for the second one.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.840]   I've lost a dog and it broke my heart.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.900]   - Yeah.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.720]   - But-
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:44.720]   - And you'll never, you'll never lose that pain,
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.720]   but I promise you, your heart has an infinite capacity
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.060]   for the kind of love you felt with that dog.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.560]   And you'll never feel a love that replaces the whole.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.820]   Like there will never be another Buster for me.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:04.100]   But there was Kaba.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.860]   And like, you know what?
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.260]   Like, and when he's gone,
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.860]   there will never be another one of him.
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:12.680]   But you know what?
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.480]   Like when that stupid puppy that was five months old
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.060]   stumbled in, I went, I guess I'm gonna do this again.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:22.900]   And you know what?
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:23.740]   I'm so glad.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.560]   I'm so glad.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.820]   And I know, by the way, I know now,
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.820]   because, and that's where I've said, like, you know,
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:30.400]   it's that Joseph Brodsky poem, you know, a song,
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.400]   like, "I wish I knew no astronomy when stars appear."
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.140]   Like, I wish I didn't know the pain, but you know what?
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.520]   Like, I don't care.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:39.360]   I don't care.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.700]   And I believe we don't care.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.820]   I, again, I think there's something to that.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:46.400]   If something hurts so badly and you go,
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   I'm gonna do it again, I'm gonna do it again,
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.900]   then it must be of value.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.480]   It must be of real value.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.740]   - There's also a different perspective.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:53.580]   - Yeah.
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.320]   - And there's a different perspective on it, that pain.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:59.160]   So there's that, from Louis, the show of this interaction
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.540]   with an old man with Louis C.K.
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:04.940]   And he says that, 'cause Louis is mourning the loss of,
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.860]   got split up, he got dumped or whatever,
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:10.900]   and he's mourning the loss of that partner of love.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.900]   And the old man says that that is the best part.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:19.500]   Like, missing the love is still love.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.580]   The real bad part is when you forget it.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.000]   When the pain fades.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.280]   It's all gone.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.880]   But the pain is actually a kind of celebration
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.740]   of the love you had.
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.500]   - Of course.
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.120]   - Well, the opposite of love isn't hate.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.580]   The opposite of love is indifference.
[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.420]   There's no question about that.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.580]   I mean, hate is a passionate emotion.
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.040]   Love is a passionate emotion.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.420]   But, and there is a school of thought that says
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.500]   that only unfulfilled love can be truly romantic.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   But I believe that, it's what I think I learned from hospice,
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:57.420]   that I think for me, knowing the impermanence is the thing.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:02.120]   You know, it's the key.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.080]   - Yeah, it's finite.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.720]   Eventually it's gonna be over.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.260]   And so like that intensifies the feeling.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.000]   That's when you can have pure love without the drama.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.540]   - Dogs are for me a great example.
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.620]   And again, I don't know what it all means, right?
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.040]   Existentially.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.260]   But I just feel like they have that kind of love,
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:25.100]   has to be here to teach us something.
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.100]   And I feel like the fact that they're so amazing
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.140]   and just so loving and so wonderful,
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.720]   and the bond we feel is so amazing and deep
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:36.260]   and doesn't require a lot of maintenance.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.500]   And yet it's so finite.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.640]   Like it's just this short little lifespan.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:45.100]   And I feel like there's just such a lesson there.
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:50.100]   There's so much there to unpack about the nature of connection
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.100]   and loss.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:57.100]   And you know, that your heart has this infinite capacity.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.260]   Like when you're, I'm telling you when my dog died,
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:05.340]   when Buster died, I remember I thinking with certainty,
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.300]   I will never do this again
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.600]   because I'll never love that way again.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.520]   I'll never love a dog the way I love this dog.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.760]   And it's just not true.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.220]   That's just not true.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.640]   Like you have this infinite capacity.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.940]   And that makes it scary.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.700]   Actually, because like right now,
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.440]   there's so many people you could love.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.060]   There's so many dogs you could love.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.400]   Like there's so much out there.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.360]   And it requires a certain bravery
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.560]   and tremendous amount of risk to do it, you know?
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.980]   - And a commitment.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:42.700]   'Cause I think to really experience love
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:44.640]   is you just dive in.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.700]   'Cause there is a huge number of people,
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.700]   but to really like, I mean, you have to like,
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:56.440]   really dive into the full complexity,
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.620]   the full range of another human being.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.480]   - Yeah, which is hard.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.320]   Because we don't even,
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.980]   I don't know that we even feel comfortable
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.440]   diving into the full range of ourselves.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.620]   You know, there's pieces of ourselves we try to push away
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:08.900]   or not think about or.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:13.660]   - Okay, so speaking of the whole sociopath/empath
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.700]   that is all embodied in one human being, that is you,
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:21.620]   let's go back to some cases perhaps that you've worked on.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:23.380]   Something that stands out to you.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:26.620]   What's maybe the craziest,
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:28.380]   most complicated thing you've worked on?
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.740]   Is there something that pops to mind?
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:31.660]   - Craziest would be different than most complicated.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.500]   - Let's go craziest.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.200]   - Yeah, so craziest.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.040]   Ah, gosh, that's a great question.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.920]   So from a chaos standpoint,
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.320]   I mean, I see so many bizarre fact patterns
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.200]   and so many variations of people cheating with people,
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.660]   people sleeping with the nanny,
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:51.460]   people sleeping with someone's, a relative of their spouse,
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.300]   people having same sex or polyamorous relationships
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.460]   and the other person doesn't even know
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.540]   they're not monogamous.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:01.540]   Like so much craziness that you could fill 15 books.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:05.380]   In terms of complexity, you know, I mean,
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:08.000]   emotionally complex as any custody case
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.300]   is emotionally complex because you're dealing
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:14.500]   with parenting issues and what makes a good parent,
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.160]   I think is a very tricky question because, you know,
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.300]   I'm trying to convince a judge who's a better
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:26.300]   parent and that is so loaded with subjective,
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:31.300]   you know, value judgments.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.060]   - Is there just a link on the maternal presumption?
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:38.340]   Is that a thing you come face to face with often?
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:40.420]   - Well, there was, I mean, it was real.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.460]   It was the law.
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:42.500]   There was something in the law
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.000]   called the maternal presumption.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.220]   It was also known as the tender years doctrine,
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.380]   which meant that a child under the age of seven
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:51.140]   was presumed to be in the custody of the mother.
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:54.560]   Unless you could show she was an unfit mother.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.800]   So that's where the idea of like someone has to be proven
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.380]   an unfit mother came from.
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:04.380]   Now in the 80s, 1980s, that was changed.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:09.680]   But you know, under my skin is under my sovereignty.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.680]   I mean, you can't suggest that there isn't in the world
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:20.760]   a suggestion that a mother who births a child and feeds a child
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:25.980]   with her body doesn't have a particular bond with a child
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:29.740]   that's different than a father's bond with a child.
[01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:32.560]   So where do we put that?
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.740]   How much importance do we put on it?
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.100]   Now that there's better and more research
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:40.860]   in the mental health field about attachment theory
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.280]   and infants, there's also a lot of, you know,
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:48.480]   a lot of research on how is attachment formed?
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.820]   How should parenting schedules be put together?
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:55.820]   How should parents put together based on attachment theory?
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:59.320]   But you know, there's conflicting perspectives on that.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.200]   - And so as judge to judge, you see like,
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.620]   is there a lot of variation?
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.200]   - Yeah, there is because there's lots of kinds of judges.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.400]   Like there's judges that are thoughtful, enlightened,
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.480]   interested in the mental health research.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.820]   And there's judges that just want,
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.940]   were unsuccessful lawyers that were good politically
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.480]   and got elected and they just wanna, you know,
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.660]   they just want a job where like they show up at nine o'clock,
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.540]   two o'clock and that they leave at 4:30
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.040]   and they get a certain number of weeks vacation
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.820]   and a pension after 20 years.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:29.360]   - So what is in general the process
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.740]   of these custody battles?
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:34.580]   Like what's the landscape here?
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:39.360]   - Well, most, the overwhelming majority of custody cases
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.660]   don't end up in my office.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:46.660]   They are a negotiation between two people
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:48.960]   that love their children more than they dislike
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.500]   their soon to be ex.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:55.500]   So the overwhelming majority of cases are just two people
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.700]   going, okay, how are we gonna make decisions together?
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.160]   'Cause there are decisions that have to be made about kids.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.660]   Will it go to public or private school?
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.120]   Can they go on medication if they need it or not?
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.620]   Should we change pediatricians?
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.160]   You know, all those kinds of things.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.460]   How do we make decisions?
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:13.160]   And when will we each spend time with the kids?
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.740]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.920]   Most custody cases are just a discussion,
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.340]   a negotiation between counsel.
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:22.680]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.500]   And so most custody cases are just that.

[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.400]   And so most custody cases are just that.

[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.220]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:38.060]   And so most custody cases are just that.

[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:43.880]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:44.720]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.560]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.380]   And so most custody cases are just that.

[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.560]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.380]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.220]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:53.060]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:53.880]   And so most custody cases are just that.
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.000]   - And it's usually gonna be what, infidelity?
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.760]   You do have a chapter called "Everybody Fucks the Nanny."
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.120]   - "Everybody's Fucking the Nanny."
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:00.960]   - "Everybody's Fucking the Nanny."
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.260]   - Yeah, there's a nanny fascination out there.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:05.380]   I try to explain it in the book, but yeah.
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.960]   I mean, I've had some great nanny stories.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.640]   I mean, people run off with the nanny.
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:12.500]   People end up getting married to the nanny.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.800]   I had one where he convinced her
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.460]   that they should have a threesome with the nanny.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.680]   They got the nanny drunk.
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.500]   They had a bunch of threesomes with the nanny.
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.500]   And then the nanny and the wife paired up
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:24.540]   and left him.
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.380]   - Oh, nice.
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.620]   - And they're still quite happy.
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:28.460]   - That seems like a happy ending to the whole thing.
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.840]   - For everyone but him.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.960]   But it was his idea.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.700]   - Well, he's really gonna have a nanny fascination now.
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:34.660]   - Now he's, yeah.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:36.420]   Well, now he's gotta see the nanny
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:39.300]   who's now the like step-parent to the kids.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.920]   And it was his bright idea
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.500]   of let's have a threesome with the nanny.
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:45.340]   You know?
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.160]   Yeah, I mean, the nanny thing,
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:50.000]   I think is a function of, in many circumstances,
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.120]   is the characteristics of the wife
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.780]   that he remembers fondly
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.500]   and that have been extinguished
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.000]   by the presence of children.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.360]   So my words of wisdom is not,
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.420]   don't get a nanny or make sure you get an ugly nanny.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:14.080]   My thought on it is that a woman should remember
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.960]   even when she's a mother,
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.700]   that she's also a woman who a man,
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.740]   you know, they fell in love with each other.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:22.740]   And she should take time to be in touch
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:26.440]   with the part of herself that is an independent woman
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.860]   that's interesting and interested.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.540]   And, you know, like there's a lot to be learned
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:34.040]   from divorced couples because like divorced couples,
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.820]   if you do it right, it's awesome.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:40.280]   Like I had a wonderful experience parenting
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.200]   and being divorced 'cause I divorced
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.780]   when my kids were quite young.
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.820]   My co-parent, you know, my ex-wife is awesome.
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.400]   She's a great mom, nice person.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.820]   We're good friends.
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.360]   And it was great.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.360]   I had half the time.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.600]   I had my kids and I could focus on them.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.860]   And the other half of the time,
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:58.020]   they were with the other person who loves them
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.400]   as much as I do.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:01.700]   And I didn't have any of the responsibilities of kids.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.400]   And I could just have, you know,
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.740]   all of the wonderful fun that you can have
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.120]   when you don't have, you know,
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:11.200]   the responsibilities that come with full-time caring
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.280]   for children, so.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.660]   - What would you say now on the flip positive side,
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:19.020]   we've been talking about the collapse of things.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.400]   What about success?
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.980]   What's the secret to successful?
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:24.980]   What's the secret to successful romantic relationship?
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:28.220]   - My mom used to say that it's hard to define intelligence,
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.100]   but you could spot stupid a mile away.
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.100]   - Yeah.
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:35.320]   - So I'm much better at pointing out
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.060]   where people fall apart 'cause I spend a lot of time
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:43.740]   with people who have fallen apart in their relationship.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:48.740]   So it's easy to then say, well, just don't do what they do.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:51.600]   But I don't know that that's not an overstatement.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.600]   It's an oversimplification.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:29:00.140]   So again, I think the answer is connection.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:05.760]   I think the answer is affection, presence, you know,
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:11.220]   mindfulness and presence.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.220]   I do think in my personal and professional experience
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.220]   that most people,
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:26.220]   most people want you fully more than they just want you
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:28.520]   in a disconnected way.
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:33.100]   So if you were to say to your romantic partner,
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:35.940]   you can have me for two hours
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:38.480]   where I'm giving you my undivided attention
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.720]   and I'm really joyful to be with you.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.380]   Or you can have me for eight hours
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.300]   where I'm sort of half paying attention
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:50.100]   and I kind of want to be someplace else for part of the time.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:51.220]   There's just no choice there.
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.800]   It's so obvious.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.800]   So I think presence is a big piece.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:58.060]   And I think that,
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:05.340]   I think the you, the me and the we, I think is important.
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:09.260]   Because I think in relationships,
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.140]   there's you and there's me and we meet
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:16.640]   and something magical happens, you know,
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.840]   and we become we, and now there's you and there's me.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.000]   And there's we.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.260]   And then the we gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:27.220]   And isn't it great?
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.640]   'Cause it's such a nice warm place.
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:34.640]   It gets so big, but it gets so big that you get small
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.600]   and me gets small 'cause we.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.960]   And if any of us dares to ask,
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.920]   "Well, what about you?
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.760]   What about me?"
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:42.600]   No, no, no, the we.
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.420]   What, you don't like the we?
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.260]   You don't want to be with the we?
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.600]   Like, whoa, whoa, no, it's not that.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:50.500]   But the we only exists 'cause there was you and there was me.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.340]   And I really like you and you really liked me.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:57.120]   And so we picked each other out of lots of choices.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:00.540]   And now this we is so fucking big,
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:03.840]   like it threatens to just consume all of it, you know?
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:08.840]   And I really think that there's something there
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.160]   we have to look at more honestly.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.200]   - So the we should not consume everything,
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:17.800]   but at the same time, not be small.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.120]   - Well, the we is the you and the me.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.580]   And if you mix it so much that you and me loses
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:29.580]   its components that all that's left is we,
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:33.040]   like, I don't think that that's the way to do it.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.240]   I just think there's a,
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:38.040]   the world pulls us in that direction.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.500]   Like we get told culturally that,
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.740]   well, why aren't you going with this person to that?
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:44.820]   Why would you do that by yourself?
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:45.880]   And why?
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:46.740]   Why?
[01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:49.740]   Like anyone knows that there's joy in being away,
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.620]   away from each other and there's joy being reunited together.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:55.860]   So why, why don't we, you know,
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.080]   speak very honestly about that?
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:58.900]   You know, it's very,
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.280]   and I think some of that's our own insecurity, you know,
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.820]   well, why don't you want to be with me 24 hours a day?
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:04.780]   Aren't I wonderful?
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:05.740]   Aren't I delightful?
[01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:06.860]   It's like, well, wait, what?
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:07.780]   You know?
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:12.080]   - Well, but also probably people are either afraid
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.400]   or lazy in developing their individual selves.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.080]   I mean, it's still,
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.360]   it's lonely going out there in the world by yourself.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.240]   And it's comforting in that little cocoon of we.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.600]   - I mean, it can also be incredibly adventurous
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.200]   going out into the world by yourself
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.860]   and then coming back to the we with a full report.
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.700]   - Yeah.
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:30.520]   - You know, coming back and saying like,
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.600]   oh my God, guess what I saw?
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:32.440]   Guess what I did?
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.200]   Oh my God, we have to go there together now.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.060]   'Cause all I could think about was you.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:36.900]   - Yeah.
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:37.740]   - You know, while I was there, I was like,
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:38.560]   oh my God, she would love this.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.400]   - Yeah.
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.160]   - You know, like that's magical.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.280]   That's amazing.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.600]   Like, like I look what I brought you back.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.820]   You know, I went into this
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.780]   and then I got you this present from there.
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:48.980]   Like there's something, you know,
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.740]   and we know this, you know,
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:52.780]   I always thought it was, you know,
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:54.780]   like when you watch the old Westerns, you know,
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:58.560]   or like the, you know, the heroes leaving, you know,
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.820]   and he's walking away from the cabin
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.280]   'cause he's gonna go fight the gunfight
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.600]   and she runs up and she goes,
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.740]   "Please don't go, don't go, stay here with me."
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:08.600]   And he like kisses her and then he goes.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:09.440]   - Yeah.
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.480]   - You know, if he goes like, yeah, you're right.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.560]   I'll just stay here, it's cool.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:12.400]   You know, like this is,
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.020]   I didn't wanna deal with that anyway.
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:15.680]   Like he's not the hero anymore then.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.520]   - Yeah.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.600]   Yeah, there's deep truth to that.
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:19.440]   - Yeah.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.400]   - And then probably, like you mentioned, sex.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.360]   - Sex is?
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.440]   - Probably a big part of it.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.940]   Friendship.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.800]   That seems to me like a really important one.
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.300]   - Depends on how you define friend.
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:33.440]   Like I, you know, if being a friend
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.720]   means we have some connection to each other
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.600]   and we have each other's cell phone numbers,
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.180]   okay, then we're friends.
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.980]   But if it's a bigger definition than that,
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:43.260]   if it's like, you've picked me up at the airport,
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:46.400]   you know, or like, you know, you're someone I could call
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.220]   that it's like, dude, I gotta hide a body.
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.980]   Like you get shovel and lime.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:54.340]   - I like how you escalated from airport pickup to murder.
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:55.600]   - Yeah, I tried to go in two directions.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.420]   - You're a true New Yorker.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:57.880]   - Well, I have to tell you, I define, you know,
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.640]   the Ben Affleck movie, "The Town," you know,
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.380]   that scene, that's friendship to me.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:06.760]   I mean, to me, the ideal male friendship is the scene
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:09.420]   where he says, "I need you to come with me.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:10.520]   We're gonna hurt some people
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.180]   and you never have to ask me about it again."
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:13.020]   - Oh yeah.
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:14.520]   - And he says, "Whose car are we taking?"
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.340]   - Yeah.
[01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:17.520]   - And that's sort of like, to me, that's friendship.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:17.840]   - Mm-hmm. - So it's, it's a high level.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.720]   It's a high bar, you know, to be like a friend.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.840]   So when you say like friendship,
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.500]   I think that's the kind of friendship
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.600]   you should ideally have with your romantic partner.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.640]   If you're getting married, it should be the like,
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.800]   whose car are we taking?
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.800]   Like, it should be that it's you and me.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:36.540]   - To be fair, that bar's reached with me
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:38.540]   with a lot of people.
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.800]   Like if you called me tomorrow, there's a body.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.140]   - But you're a big open, you're a big open heart.
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:47.460]   - But it's true, like I wonder how many people out there
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.460]   are like that in terms of hiding the body.
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:53.500]   - I mean, my theory on this,
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:56.660]   'cause I think I'm like you in that way.
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:01.540]   I think, I think I, I'm very sensitive.
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:05.340]   I feel things really deeply, you know?
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:09.620]   And I think it's, it's, that's a terror.
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.580]   The world is terrifying when you feel things very deeply
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:15.340]   because there's so much pain, there's so much betrayal.
[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:17.080]   There's so many opportunities to be hurt.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.620]   You know?
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:23.240]   And I think when you are that kind of person,
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.320]   you go through like stages.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.280]   And one of them is that I don't care, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.380]   It doesn't matter, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.740]   I don't feel anything, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.620]   Well, you try to convince yourself, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:34.660]   It's fine, I don't feel anything.
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:36.200]   And then at some point, like, you know,
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.880]   you do feel all of it.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.700]   And then it's like, oh my God, the weight of this is,
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:42.280]   I mean, I think it's the whole arc of Pink Floyd, "The Wall."
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.380]   It's literally the entire arc of Pink Floyd, "The Wall."
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:46.700]   - Yeah. - You know?
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.280]   And then the song "Stop."
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.580]   You know, I want to go home, take off this uniform
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:51.400]   and leave the show.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.460]   Like you just, when you feel all of it,
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:56.320]   the army of hammers coming at you,
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.280]   the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.400]   you know, the thousand natural shocks the flesh is heir to.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.400]   When you feel all of that deeply, you know, it's very hard.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.500]   But it can also be a superpower
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:14.400]   because I think when you can bring that to a relationship,
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.320]   when you can bring that to a profession,
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.980]   like you've done and I've done,
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.620]   then there's something very magical about that.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:25.320]   The ability to bring it out in someone,
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.440]   to feel it in yourself, to understand it, you know,
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.280]   is a gift.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.520]   It's a wonderful, wonderful gift.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.440]   I'm humbled by what it brought me professionally.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.780]   And I'd like to think that you and I have both found
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.560]   professions that enable us to use that sensitivity,
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.940]   that empathy in a productive and good way.
[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:48.600]   And in a fulfilling, a personally fulfilling way.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:52.100]   And ideally in a way that does good for other people.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.100]   - You yourself are incredibly successful
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.100]   and high performer.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.480]   You've dealt with a lot of CEOs
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.280]   and just high performers in all walks of life.
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:08.280]   What can you say about successful relationships
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.060]   with those kinds of folks?
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:12.520]   - That's a good question.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.560]   I think...
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.560]   - Is it all the same stuff or there's something different?
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:19.100]   Or there's something special when they're busier?
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:23.800]   - Well, you know, I think when you represent
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.140]   high net worth individuals, but also high performing,
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.720]   I would make a distinction between high net worth
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:29.560]   and high performing.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:32.220]   So I've done high net worth divorces
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:34.560]   where the person's like a trust fund kid,
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.820]   even though they're an adult, you know,
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:38.280]   but they're like, what they did to achieve
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.060]   their high net worth status is their great grandfather died.
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:41.900]   - Sure.
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:45.180]   - You know, so that is different than someone who is self-made,
[01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:49.340]   who through discipline, focus, entrepreneurship,
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:50.980]   you know, whatever it might be,
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:54.760]   that they have found success.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.800]   And there's also a difference between financial success
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.640]   and fame, 'cause I've represented famous people
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:05.060]   that actually did not have that much money
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:08.100]   in the scheme of things or much liquidity.
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:11.600]   And I've represented people that were not in any way famous
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.760]   and were very high performing in their field.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:14.800]   Like in New York,
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:17.140]   I've represented people that were not in any way famous
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:18.720]   and were very high performing in their field.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.560]   And I've represented people that were not in any way famous
