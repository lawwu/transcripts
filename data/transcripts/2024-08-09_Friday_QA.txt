[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400]   Hey Joshua, thanks for having me.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400]   My pleasure.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.440]   Yeah, I was hoping for some personal advice from you today.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440]   Great.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.640]   I'm pretty good at thinking things through, so I spent the last few minutes waiting for
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.040]   the pop on the call and trying to elegantly frame the question, but I'll just jump right
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.040]   into it.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.840]   Basically, I'm in my late 20s and trying to figure out some direction with a career.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.880]   I've got a few different things that I've had going for quite some time, different kind
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.200]   of part-time jobs and pseudo careers in different fields, and I've bounced between things a
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   bit.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.820]   I'm really trying to narrow in on one thing, and so I'm not quite sure what direction to
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.820]   pivot in.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.360]   I was hoping I could maybe lay that out to you.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.360]   Okay.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.240]   Yeah, so the business I quite literally grew up in was a commercial real estate appraisal
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   business.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.220]   So there's a family business that I've worked for for some time, and most of my corporate
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.080]   background is in real estate appraisal.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.360]   I've also gone back and forth between that and the idea of vocational ministry inside
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360]   the church.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.120]   Both of those have kind of panned out to an extent, to somewhat, but they each kind of
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.800]   have their problems, and so I'm kind of bouncing between these two things and also maybe considering
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.840]   a third option.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.520]   The family business, you know, there's a lot of opportunity there.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.840]   There's a lot of opportunity to be an owner in this business, to grow it, but every time
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.480]   I kind of jump fully into that, there's just tensions that arise, family dynamics that
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.200]   come up, things that kind of inhibit further growth.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.440]   So I've looked at that, jumping into the business, I've looked at maybe having a career in real
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.440]   estate appraisal apart from that, but to be honest, the appraisal work itself is at times
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.120]   a little bit soul-crushing for me, so that's why I was kind of pivoting into ministry.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   So that has its own roadblocks.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.200]   I live in Los Angeles, and it's been tough to kind of pursue that full-time.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.880]   It's kind of a lifestyle where I would have to do that and do something else, and I'm
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.760]   not quite sure that I want to have all these different careers for the rest of my life.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.080]   So yeah, I'm really kind of not sure what questions to ask as I kind of interpret, like,
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.200]   okay, how do I narrow in on something and just focus and pursue something?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.280]   I don't know if that makes any sense whatsoever.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   - Absolutely.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.480]   Let's start with the family business.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Who started it?
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.120]   Are there other people in the family involved?
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.120]   How big is it?
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.120]   What's the potential of it?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.320]   Tell me a little more.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.840]   - Yeah, so my dad started it in the early '90s.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.400]   There's about eight people that work there.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.280]   The business is actually in New Orleans where I'm from.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.240]   I live in Los Angeles because life kind of brought me out here a few years ago, and I've
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.600]   worked remotely with a lot of travel back and forth for that business.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.720]   The potential for growth, there's my parents are partners in the business.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.680]   We have one other partner, and then myself as a part owner right now.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.240]   - Do you have other siblings?
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   - I do, yeah.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240]   I have two other siblings.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.000]   One of them works for the company along with his wife.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.480]   The third one does something else entirely.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.440]   - And what's the source of the tension in the family business?
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.160]   Give me some examples.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:45.240]   - Yeah, so, without getting too much away on the air, I guess, in case they ever listen
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.960]   to this, just like a bit of tension between myself and my parents.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.480]   Whenever I kind of move back to New Orleans and try to invest fully in the business, there's
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.400]   just things that come up about ways that I should live my life and different things like
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:10.360]   that that kind of create a lot of tension and threats of disownment.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.720]   And then the business always gets pulled into that as much as we try to separate business
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.380]   and personal issues.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.680]   The family issues are more personal, separate from the business, but then we'll be sitting
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.720]   in the office, and if there's a disagreement about business, then all of a sudden personal
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.280]   things get brought up, and it's like, "Wait, that doesn't really have a place here."
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.080]   - Broadly speaking, do you and your parents share similar worldviews, similar philosophies,
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.480]   similar lifestyles, or is there a radical difference there?
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.440]   - Yes and no.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.160]   For the most part, they raised me to have kind of the same faith as them, similar worldview,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.680]   but there are some areas of tension.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.720]   - Okay, well, let's start with the family business.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.720]   Financially speaking, almost certainly your best long-term financial opportunity is to
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   get involved in something related to a family business.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.440]   Now that kind of commentary would need to always be qualified based upon the specific
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.340]   type or nature of the business, but if you can get involved in a family business where
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:25.520]   you have an inside track to leadership in the business and you have the knowledge and
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.640]   accumulated experience from people who are trustworthy, you trust them and they trust
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.480]   you, financially speaking, that's probably your best opportunity, 'cause that can cut
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.640]   10 or 20 years off of your learning curve of starting any other business.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:49.800]   So if you come in at, say, 30 years old and you have a clear pathway to running the business,
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.760]   then that's probably 20 years ahead of where you otherwise would be.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.960]   So we always wanna prioritize that because it's the fast track.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.480]   Now simultaneously, there are a whole set of potential downsides of family business.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.000]   If the family can't function well together and if there's not a clear sense of shared
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.560]   purpose and vision and a camaraderie and a sense of synergy among you and any other family
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.720]   members that are involved in the business, then it could be a complete source of just
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.800]   wasted time, where you invest years into the business and eventually the family stuff undoes
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   it.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   Unfortunately, a lot of that is really not gonna be up to you.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.480]   A lot of it will be up to your parents.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.880]   If they're the ones who started the business, they're the ones who nurtured the business,
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.980]   they're the ones who built it, they're the ones who control it.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.400]   You may own 5% of the business, which means that your voice is completely worthless in
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.880]   actual day-to-day stuff.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.200]   And so in order for the family business to really be a good long-term opportunity for
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:05.020]   you, I think your parents would have to have the vision that they're working very hard
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:12.680]   to pass the business over to you, and that there's going to be a—to you and to your
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.760]   brother or sister, whoever's involved with you—there's going to be a transition period
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.960]   where they're still calling the shots.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.120]   But if they're doing it effectively and they have a vision for getting out, then it
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.360]   can be really great.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.800]   If they don't have a vision for getting out, then it could just be a complete nightmare
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.940]   for you and you never should get involved in the first place.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.820]   So you need to engage in an honest assessment.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.400]   And I really see that this is one of those—it can be extremely good and it can be extremely
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.840]   bad.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.040]   And there's probably not so much in the middle.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.480]   And with what you're describing, it's probably on the road to being extremely bad unless
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:59.080]   you can present some evidence to yourself that no, mom and dad actually are intentionally
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.600]   wanting to get out of this.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.080]   Now I would say that you're at an ideal age to start these conversations.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.280]   Twenty-two is probably too young for you to be talking—for mom and dad to be talking
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.020]   with you seriously about taking over the family business because you have not been tested.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.040]   You have not demonstrated your worth and value in the marketplace.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.280]   You haven't had enough time to mature and set the course of your life.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.400]   Thirty?
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.980]   That seems like a pretty good age—30 to 35, 30 to 40.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.680]   With a kind of an intentional transition period, this would be really good.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.280]   The challenge is, do your parents have the vision to extricate themselves and to move
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:48.920]   into the elder senior advisor role, which is going to mean that they have to be willing
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:56.120]   to turn over responsibility, turn over vision, turn over actual ownership, turn over actual
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.240]   control.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.620]   That requires a lot of trust from them.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.480]   So you need to get some kind of assessment as to see, are we actually going in this direction
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.820]   or not?
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.720]   Do you think it would be comfortable if you fly to New Orleans and you spend a weekend
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.960]   with your parents?
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.420]   Would it be comfortable to just spend hours talking about the future of the business and
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.080]   how they see you being involved in that?
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.420]   Is that something that could flow smoothly among you?
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.820]   I definitely think it could, yeah.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:27.000]   I actually have a trip coming up next week, a regularly scheduled trip to New Orleans
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.200]   there.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.920]   So I would suggest that this be a standard part of your discussion.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.080]   What you need to be confident about is, what do your parents actually see?
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.960]   What's their vision?
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.000]   They may not have thought about it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.480]   So I don't think you should be super hasty about any particular decision.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.520]   If they haven't thought about it and they don't have a vision, okay, fine, well, we'll
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.880]   just start talking about it and it may take a couple of years.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:58.440]   But you need to have confidence that they're actually planning to turn the business over
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   to you and then we got to talk about your sibling and see how that would work out.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.680]   But it needs to be something that they're working very intentionally towards.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.760]   It's not the kind of thing that's likely to be three years, but it shouldn't be 20 years
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.120]   and it probably shouldn't even be 10, maybe 10 as the longest, and I'm just kind of making
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   these numbers up.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.560]   I'm trying to say that you don't want to arrive yourself at 40 years old and at that point
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.880]   in time find out that, no, mom and dad don't have even the slightest hint of giving up
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.400]   control and you're going to be sitting around until you're 70 when they're finally dead
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.280]   and gone and then you can finally do it.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.040]   But by that time you're going to be fighting with your sibling nonstop and it's just going
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   to be a nightmare.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.720]   It would have been better off for you to go off on your own and build your own thing.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.520]   So just kind of start those conversations.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.920]   If you can do that, then financially that would probably be your biggest opportunity.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.600]   Now we then have to go to the lifestyle of do you actually like the business?
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.400]   Is this because we don't want something that's soul crushing?
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.920]   But maybe that's just the current job that you're in and maybe it could grow from there.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:10.760]   But it's important that you really have confidence that mom and dad, if I can demonstrate my
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:17.680]   competence and my trustworthiness, mom and dad really want to turn this thing over to
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680]   me.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.120]   If that's there, then you could proceed forward down kind of the pathway in a systematic way.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.520]   If it's not there and you become convinced it's not there, don't even do it because I've
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.760]   seen this with my own grandfather and his father.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:41.160]   My own grandfather lost 15 years of his life because his father needed some work done.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.900]   He couldn't run the family business anymore.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.080]   My grandfather said, "All right, I'll do it."
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:53.200]   But my great grandfather was never willing and able to give up control.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.040]   My grandfather could never please his father.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:03.000]   He was never able to cross over and gain the respect of his father, even though objectively
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.240]   I don't see any reason that that shouldn't have been obvious.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:13.400]   But my great grandfather was such a control freak and such a terrible manager of human
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.120]   relations and had no vision for kind of what he's actually growing and building in the
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.120]   long run that it robbed my grandfather of a decade and a half of his life.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.440]   So just be super careful of that because you don't want to lose a decade and a half of
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   your life.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:36.200]   I think the thing I'm comparing it to, again, so it would be kind of a total career pivot,
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.400]   which what I've been considering is law school.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.320]   So while I'm working for my parents and doing these other odd jobs, I have been kind of
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.880]   on the side just studying for the LSAT, about to take it tomorrow, putting together the
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.480]   application package, you know, my practice test, I'm taking it for real, practice tests
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.520]   are coming in like upper 160s, low 170s, so like there could be some opportunity for a
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.360]   good school there and maybe some scholarship opportunity.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.840]   But I'm hesitant with the whole idea of, I know I'm only 28, but there's still this kind
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:12.440]   of sense of like, man, do I start from scratch, do three years of school, grind it out at
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.880]   a firm for a few years before I really start making progress in that career?
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.720]   I'm in my mid thirties at that point, not quite sure how to gauge all of that.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   Are you married?
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   Do you have children?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.000]   No, I'm single.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.280]   There is someone I would like to move towards marriage with, but yeah, currently single.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.640]   I would go to law school.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.800]   No question in my mind about it.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.200]   If you're scoring well on the LSAT and you have an interest in it, I think you should
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.840]   go to law school.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.640]   One of my great regrets for myself is that I didn't go to law school.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.240]   I may still go in the future, don't cry for me, but in hindsight, I look back on it and
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.200]   I see that my mind is perfectly suited for the legal business and the legal business
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.400]   has so many different expressions of it.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.940]   I would encourage you to go to law school.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.160]   It won't take that long, even if you do go ahead and marry.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:07.000]   If you find a woman who's fantastic, go ahead and marry, but you won't regret getting it
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.720]   done and all you got to do is basically get through the first year where it's the most
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.760]   intense, and then you'll be able to go to these other aspects and that will give you
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:22.000]   an extremely valuable career plan that you can use in so many expressions.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.520]   And I would see that as an ideal fit even for your inclinations to Christian ministry,
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:36.720]   that having the ability to be a self-employed lawyer with even just a modest independent
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.000]   practice that gives you control over yourself, you'd be giving up the highest potential income,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.120]   but it would give you the foundation to have the flexibility for effective Christian ministry.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.560]   And you're never going to be free of effective Christian ministry.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.620]   You are called to be a minister because you are a Christian man.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.240]   Now that's different than signing up for a job working for a big church that's going
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.600]   to pay you a big salary, and so finding a balance where you can effectively express
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.160]   your ministry work and also earn income and support your family, and sometimes those things
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.880]   are aligned, sometimes they're not.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.000]   To me that would be ideal, but I don't see any reason why you wouldn't prioritize going
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.840]   to law school based upon what you described.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.120]   And then on the other side of law school, there are lots of new opportunities open to
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   you.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.920]   There is the legal career, but it's such a phenomenal foundation for so many other aspects
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.180]   of corporate work, business work, that it's just an incredibly flexible and effective
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.960]   course of education.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.480]   Well, that's highly encouraging to hear.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.480]   I would say go for it.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.560]   Before you go too deep, sound out your mom and dad.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.520]   Get a sense of where they're going.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.840]   Start talking with your sibling that's in the business.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:58.000]   And I would be blunt about it, meaning that there's no reason to pussyfoot around here
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.040]   and like, "Ah, well, I'm not so sure."
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:06.220]   Clearly, you don't want to overstep your boundaries.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.740]   You're not trying to take the business from your mom and dad, but you're trying to get
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.100]   a clear idea of, "Hey, what are you thinking?
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.860]   What's the future for me here?"
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.860]   Because I'm rolling up on 30.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.160]   There might be a woman out there, I'm thinking about my life, I'd like to understand.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.460]   I'm interested in this career, I'm interested in the business, I'm worried about what that
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:30.900]   would look like, given some of our other questions and other challenges, what are your intentions?
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:36.300]   I think that if I were talking to your parents, what I would tell them is it's the responsibility
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:43.100]   of the parental generation to be intentionally, in a very focused way, vacating the seats
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.940]   of leadership and moving into the seats of being an advisor.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.340]   It's the same exact model in business as it is as a parent.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:56.100]   As a father, in the early years of my children's lives, I'm working really, really hard to
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.020]   control them, to control what they do, to control how they do it, to control how they
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.300]   spend their time.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:08.100]   I'm being super, super intentional to control their activities, control their development,
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.220]   all of those things in a very controlling way.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:18.860]   Then as they start to hit double digits in age, then I'm very intentionally pulling back
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:24.820]   my control, and I'm very intentionally pushing them into situations that are going to continue
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.140]   to stretch them.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.940]   I want them to be exposed to challenges that they don't quite feel prepared for, I want
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.660]   them to be stretched, I want them to be pushed, I want them to be pushed beyond a little bit
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.700]   of their ability.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.660]   Not pushed to the point of being broken, but I want them to fail continually because they're
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.980]   being pushed.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:48.700]   And then the goal is, very aggressively, I'm moving them towards independence so that when
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:56.460]   my children reach adulthood, I am no longer trying to push them in any way.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.680]   I'm there as an advisor who's ready for them when they ask a question and who's simply
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.460]   focusing on maintaining a good relationship.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:11.120]   And then as adults, I would only step in if I saw a potentially fatal error, just like
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.540]   I would with anybody else.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.660]   But I'm not going to be in controlling their lives or manipulating them or doing any of
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.260]   those kinds of things.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.700]   So with a business, it should be a similar pathway, especially if I have children that
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.220]   I'm bringing up in a business.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.060]   In the early years, I'm going to really put the yoke on them.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.180]   I'm going to try to break them, put heavy responsibility, heavy control, this is how
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.180]   we do it.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.220]   You know, you're going to work your way up from the bottom.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.320]   There's a reason why some of that's there.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.500]   But that's not a 30-year thing.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.820]   There's a bit of hazing, right, a bit of an apprentice program, a little bit of indentured
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.420]   servitude with some significant challenges.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.300]   But it's not a long-term thing.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.140]   It's just a test to see, do you really want it?
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.240]   Do you have the character to get through it?
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.300]   Think of it like a boot camp of sorts.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.460]   Why do you go through a boot camp experience in most militaries?
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:02.180]   Well, part of it is to very quickly convey a whole lot of knowledge and a whole lot of
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.180]   understanding.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.320]   But a lot of it is to test the person, to see, are you the kind of person who breaks
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.520]   under pressure?
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.820]   So in a business-wise, we're not doing a boot camp, but you're trying to put on and
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.220]   say, are you the kind of person who breaks under pressure or are you a man of character?
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.940]   Once there's evidence that, no, this guy's a man of character, he can handle it, then
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.100]   they should be pulling that off intentionally.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.460]   And then it's a matter of teaching, teaching, teaching, teaching, teaching, raising up to
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:34.340]   positions of authority and leadership and power, putting responsibility onto the shoulders,
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:39.020]   and then intentionally moving into a position of being a senior advisor.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:44.060]   And so ideally, by the time, if I'm running a family business and my children are taking
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:49.520]   over, by the time I'm hitting my 50s and 60s, I'm basically out of it and I've turned it
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.920]   over to the children who were in their 30s and 40s.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:58.160]   And by setting that cycle, hopefully, well, I'm still there, I'm still involved, but I'm
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.760]   no longer driving it, then we're raising up maturity.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.400]   And that's what we need in the next generation.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.720]   So I see a parallel there, and that's what I think, that's what, in my mind, your parents
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.080]   should be doing.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.120]   But in order to do that, they have to be willing to let you fail, they have to be willing to
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.080]   let you make mistakes, and they have to be willing to give up control, which is understandably
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080]   difficult.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.480]   For people who have the kind of personality and character to go out and start a family
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:32.180]   business and then to nurture it into maturity and to deal with all of that, to then intentionally
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:36.800]   pull back requires a very different mindset than a lot of people have, which is why it
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.480]   fails so many times.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:46.560]   Yeah, that really helps me clarify kind of the question that's in front of me.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.560]   That's super helpful.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.560]   Good.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.560]   I'm glad.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.160]   Keep in touch, talk with them, and then let's see where things go in the coming months.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.160]   Daniel in Texas, welcome to the show.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.820]   How can I serve you today?
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.820]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.520]   Hope you're having a good day.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   And you as well.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.520]   I have a question about franchises for you.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   Okay.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.280]   A basic question is, how do you feel about owning a franchise?
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:16.080]   And a second layer with that is, obviously, numbers matter for a franchise, all that kind
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.160]   of stuff, but in general, but also especially when you bear it in mind against buying an
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.040]   existing business, starting something else from scratch.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.000]   I feel very positively inclined towards franchises.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.040]   And let me just dwell on that for a moment.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.040]   I was going to do a separate show on this, I'll stick it in here, and who knows whether
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:40.080]   I do it in the future, but I consider my biggest business mistake that I never understood until
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:47.640]   literally about probably three years ago was my biggest business mistake in my own life
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:54.560]   was thinking that the basic element of being a businessman was having a good business idea.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.180]   For whatever reason, I always thought, I studied business, I got a degree in business, I wanted
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.400]   to be a businessman, I wanted to be an entrepreneur.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:06.000]   And I thought for years and years and years that, okay, that means I need to come up with
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.160]   a good business idea.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.880]   And so I would spend my time looking for a good business idea.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:17.240]   And even the business that you know of radical personal finance, it was founded on the concept
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.120]   of a good business idea, meaning a style of show, a type of content that would be unique
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.720]   in the marketplace.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.680]   That was at its core.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.160]   In hindsight, that was the dumbest, most short-sighted thing I could ever do.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.880]   It would have been so much smarter to just simply choose a business that is working and
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.260]   then go do it.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.040]   And I never even thought of it.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.660]   And so franchising is kind of a shortcut pathway to choosing a business that's working and
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.420]   going and doing it.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:53.540]   So I think that it should be a primary opportunity that many people look into because it is the
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:59.880]   most direct pathway to having all of the benefits of business ownership.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.440]   And it usually doesn't require good luck.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.120]   It usually doesn't require a unique idea.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:11.140]   It simply requires an appropriate concept, an appropriate market to apply that concept
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:17.820]   to, appropriate financial capacity for the business owner, and appropriate execution
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.700]   on the plan mixed with just a little bit of serendipity with the marketplace.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.640]   So I'm hugely in favor of it.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.600]   Now we can go on to part two.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:35.520]   Yeah, I mean, I guess that's with that, if you're taking that, how that compares maybe
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.960]   against as well like a franchise versus buying an existing business.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.680]   So there, I think it's going to come down to the actual concepts of the specific franchise
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:52.200]   or franchises that you're interested in, the specific dollar figures involved.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.640]   And then alternative businesses.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.080]   So we can understand the value of a franchise from the franchisor's perspective.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.480]   I have frequently recommended to people that they franchise their business because it's
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.840]   a great way to get a lot of additional value out of a business, especially in a business
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.920]   that can't quite, that's unlikely to just spread with you running everything and owning
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.320]   everything.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:20.720]   But in the value, the time that can be saved by coming into a business that is structured,
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.480]   that is systematized, and especially if there's a potential for a brand name to be building
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.440]   and sending you business directly from the value of the brand is really, really valuable.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.080]   On the other hand, it's not a magic thing.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.960]   And there's lots of businesses that are well run, that have good business owners there,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.920]   and they just aren't or weren't the kind of people who are aggressively trying to get
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.240]   every dollar they could possibly get from it.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.980]   So they just run their business and they're good to go.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.240]   And you can come in and you can buy them.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.560]   And especially in today's world with the retiring baby boom generation, I think that if you
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.860]   can come across one of those, then it's worth doing.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.840]   It's hard sometimes to come across them because they're often not advertised until the very
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.600]   end when they're with a business broker, whereas franchises are aggressively advertised so
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.000]   they're easier to look at and consider.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.960]   Right.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:20.720]   Do you have any thoughts on, and obviously each franchise does things a little bit different,
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:29.160]   do you have any feelings on when it comes to actually the back-end brands, the ongoing
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:35.680]   royalties and stuff, how much past a certain point is not worth it?
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:42.920]   I'm going to guess that the answer to that is going to depend on how long the franchise
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.120]   has actually been in business.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.180]   So let's assume that you're dealing with a mature franchise.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.720]   It must be working.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:54.880]   Unless there's something about newer contracts versus older contracts, it must be working.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.480]   One of the things I'm enormously grateful for is just the power of the free market,
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.340]   that in general, the market works all that stuff out for us.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:08.560]   And so in many cases, if you pay what someone's asking, it's probably going to work out.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.760]   Think of this like when you go to sell a car or sell a house or something like that.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.720]   The very first thing that you do, if you're going to sell a car or a boat that you have,
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.480]   is you go to the marketplace and you kind of get a sense of what is happening in the
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.200]   marketplace.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.120]   And you get a sense of kind of this is the market number.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.520]   Then you look at your actual product and you say, "Well, is my car extra shiny?
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.920]   Is it in extra good condition?
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.360]   Well, if so, then I'll go ahead and mark it up at a premium."
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   And then you look at your motivation.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.040]   Do I really need to sell quickly?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.260]   Well, let me mark it down a little bit.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.080]   But in your own business, you generally look to the marketplace first, so the marketplace
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   keeps prices consistent.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.360]   Now it's no different when selling a business that you're going to go to the marketplace
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.480]   and you're going to look at your competitors and you understand that if you're selling
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.320]   a franchise, you're in competition with all the other franchisors, all the other offerings
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.600]   that are out there.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.360]   So you're probably going to choose a fair price.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.600]   And if some bozo walked in off the street, took your contract the way that you offered
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.400]   it, signed it with no negotiation, it's probably good enough.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.900]   Now, should you negotiate?
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   Should you push?
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.680]   And should you inform yourself and look at other competitors?
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.400]   Of course, because we need to make sure that we're not dealing with a scammer.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.440]   But I think the biggest danger would just be, "Am I franchisee number three?"
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.320]   Well, if I'm franchisee number three, then there's just not a lot of experience that
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.000]   we have to know that this model really works.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.540]   But beyond that, I think that whatever they're asking is probably going to be competitive
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.960]   with other options that are out there.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   Okay.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.960]   Cool.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.600]   That's all I needed to know.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   Thank you, sir.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   My pleasure.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.600]   All right.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   We move on to Nick in New York.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   Welcome to the show, Nick.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.600]   How can I serve you today?
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   Can you hear me?
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   Sounds good.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   Yes.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:58.400]   So my high-level question is how much do you push your children to study a topic that you
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.400]   think is good for them, but they're not necessarily naturally attracted to?
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:09.280]   And so the details of this is that I have two kids, and my daughter is eight years old.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   She's very smart.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.760]   I think my biased opinion, but she's very sort of classically smart, right?
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.440]   So she's very much into reading classical novels.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:24.800]   She has developed a vocabulary that's much richer than other kids of the same age.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.860]   And pretty much if you give her free time, what she'll do is she'll just start reading
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.680]   a book.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:36.280]   Now she's reading world record Guinness books, but sort of interesting books to her.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:42.360]   About two years ago, I realized that at school she was struggling a little bit with math.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.520]   And so at the time I decided to start working with her.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.080]   She goes to public school.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.160]   So I decided to start working with her, and we started doing Life of Fred.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.820]   And we pretty much covered all the gaps that she had, and we went further ahead.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:03.360]   So she's, in theory, she could deal with, let's say third grade and fourth grade material
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.040]   at the moment, even though she's starting third grade this fall.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.800]   Now all of that said, she's not naturally attracted to math.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.440]   So she would do it if I told her to, right, because she's just very obedient.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.280]   She was very excited when we were doing Life of Fred, but in hindsight, I realized that
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.760]   she was excited because of the story aspect of Life of Fred, rather than because she was
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.080]   very excited about the math itself.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.520]   And I am sort of, in my social circle is a high achievement circle.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:40.880]   So parents are sending their kids to Sunday math school, and they're participating international
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   math competitions.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.800]   They're teaching their kids, similar age, how to touch type.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:53.680]   And so I'm vacillating between making sure that she's, quote unquote, ahead of her peers
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:00.420]   and ahead of public school and spending time with her, versus allowing her to just develop
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.040]   the way that she would naturally develop, where it seems, again, that she's more of
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:12.760]   this classical woman interested in novels and that kind of thing.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.800]   People, not things and concepts.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   Correct.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   Correct.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.080]   So, and that's where I am, right?
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.640]   She's eight years old, and I don't know if it's sort of, she's still young enough where
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.060]   I should say, no, come and study with me.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:31.800]   I want to make sure that you do this or whether I start making sure that she's okay at school,
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.440]   but letting her spend the time where her talents seem to lay.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   Right.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.440]   Right.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   It's a good question.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.560]   And I'm not going to give you any kind of clear, specific answer because you're going
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:50.560]   to test different ideas, different concepts, and see what's working at this particular
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.200]   point in time.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.080]   So let me just begin with some big picture philosophies.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.880]   Philosophy number one is that in general, I think most of us are better off leaning
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   into our strengths and really developing our strengths to a very high level versus trying
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.920]   to spend all of our time on our weaknesses.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:18.020]   So putting this in a scholastic perspective, let's imagine that your eight-year-old daughter
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:26.000]   loves nothing but novels, and she reads and she reads and she reads and she reads.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.700]   And you encourage her in that classical direction.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.860]   Many times, somebody who is a committed reader will naturally become a committed writer.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:44.200]   If she goes on and develops that and spends her teenage years and adolescent years writing
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.160]   and publishing novels, and she arrives at the age of 18 and she's looking out at the
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:55.200]   world and she's published five or six novels of her own and sold some thousands of copies
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:03.780]   of them, she will be highly sought after as a student to the most prestigious and exclusive
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:04.780]   colleges.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:11.360]   She'll have lots of pathways that are open to her because she's very strong in a particular
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.840]   area.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.920]   Now let's pretend that instead of doing that, you say, "No, I'm going to cut back
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.000]   on the reading and I'm going to put in math, and we're just going to do math."
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.240]   And let's assume that she scrapes in and she does AP Calculus in her senior year of
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.280]   high school, and she scrapes in by the skin of her teeth and gets a three on the AP Calculus
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.860]   AB exam.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.800]   That doesn't help her in any way because she's not a standout person.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.240]   She doesn't have any particular area of strong expertise.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:50.360]   Yes, she learned calculus, but there's a decent chance that her path would be like
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   mine.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.080]   I couldn't even begin to talk about calculus or do calculus anymore.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:01.000]   I did calculus and I forgot it all immediately after being done with it, then boom, done.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.080]   So if you had to choose between focusing on encouraging strengths and areas of standout
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:15.760]   genius versus shoring up weaknesses, I think we're far better off focusing on strengths.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.840]   That's philosophy number one.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.200]   Philosophy number two is this.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:26.500]   I don't think that there's anybody who's really incapable of performing at a genius
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.360]   level if there's sufficient levels of interest.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:35.560]   So last year, and I never did do kind of like a summation podcast of everything that I learned,
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.180]   but I spent a lot of time last year, or I guess maybe early this year, digging into
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:46.440]   the concepts of genius and tried to review and understand what people talk about.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.860]   And in essence, if you look at the world's genius performers, at least in what are sometimes
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:35:00.120]   called friendly learning environments, if you look at world genius performers, it's
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.800]   something that can be nurtured but not forced.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   So let's use musicians as an example.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.560]   World-class musicians tend to be the children of musicians.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.920]   And if you listen to the stories of the world-class genius musicians, they get an early start
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:24.560]   on the development of their genius because they were raised in a musical environment.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:30.860]   Their parents had instruments, their parents valued playing instruments, and their parents
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:36.760]   invested into them learning and practicing music, so they got an early start.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:43.920]   But there has to come a point in time in order to become a true genius where the young person
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:51.560]   or the child has to make a conscious choice for herself to say, "I am going to do this.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.000]   This I want."
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.160]   And it has to be an internally directed, self-motivated thing.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.920]   If you're going to sit and you're going to practice your violin for seven hours a day
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   and do the kind of intentional, focused practice that's going to lead to your truly becoming
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.480]   world-class, it can't be forced on you externally.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.800]   And so the child who's going to become a world-class mathematician is going to have to cross over
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.180]   and be self-motivated.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.700]   You can't force your daughter.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:26.500]   Even though I don't think that there's any math, I doubt that there's any particular
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:32.360]   kind of math gene or any kind of natural mathematical ability.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:38.820]   People think there is, but I just see so many stories of people who when they're in school,
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.460]   they, "Oh, I'm not good at math."
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.020]   And then they're 33 years old and all of a sudden they just start, they take an interest
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.140]   in math and they're like, "I love math.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.140]   This is great."
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:54.900]   And I think that not being good at math is much more likely due to poor teaching methodology
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:01.220]   and inadequate tutoring, inadequate teaching, unattractive presentation styles than it is
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:07.020]   that there's any genetic ability with math or any kind of natural ability that is expressed
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.780]   in mathematics.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:14.280]   But in order for your daughter to go and become a mathematician, she would have to encounter
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:20.300]   a spark, something that actually so intrigued her that she wanted to do it.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:25.060]   That's what world-level, world-class genius depends upon.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:30.860]   So that's my philosophy number two, is that we want to try to expose our children to a
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.380]   broad array of things and we want them to be competent.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.740]   Your daughter's going to have an easier time if she's competent with math.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.300]   So how do you reconcile these things?
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:47.620]   I would say you reconcile it by requiring a basic level of performance in everything
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.460]   that's important to you without it becoming overwhelming.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.620]   So you're going to require your daughter to be good at math.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:59.420]   And I don't think that there's any reason why she's not going to be good at math, especially
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.680]   with the fact that you are tutoring her.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:08.860]   If you look at the standard math pathway in your local public school where your daughter's
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.220]   enrolled, there is no reason she can't get straight As at math.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:19.540]   That pathway has to accommodate children who never do homework, whose parents have no interest
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.580]   whatsoever, who are years behind where everyone else should be.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:32.820]   So what I have noticed is that if we emphasize consistency and small doses of study on a
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:40.980]   consistent basis as compared to large doses of extreme effort, then we can significantly
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:48.960]   outperform our peers without it being totally overwhelming.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.940]   So in the mathematical example, you might say, "When school's in session, I'm just going
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:01.600]   to make sure that she's doing the math work that is being assigned in her schoolwork.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.980]   But when school's out of session, we're going to do 30 minutes a day of math."
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.980]   And it may be Life of Fred, it may be Math Academy, it may be Khan Academy, but you just
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.600]   find your own kind of supplemental program.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.540]   And then what I would also do is I would try to insert ideas that are going to be helpful
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.540]   to her.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:22.480]   So instead of just always doing drill and kill math, then emphasize the narrative benefits
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.480]   of math.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.940]   Put in living math books, keep on doing Life of Fred.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:32.980]   And if your daughter is doing that and doing it consistently, then she's going to be outperforming
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.980]   in the fullness of time, but you're not going to be hindering her development of genius.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:42.660]   And then the final thing I would say is I don't think it's wrong or dumb to require
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.380]   certain things of our children.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.760]   I think it's good and healthy, but we want to make sure that our requirements are not
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.980]   onerous.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:55.240]   So requiring your daughter to sit down and do 20 minutes of math every day seems totally
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.020]   reasonable to me and very unlikely to poison her against mathematics.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.140]   Requiring her to sit down and do two hours of math every day when she doesn't really
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.720]   like it, is not really interested in it, that might be a little bit too extreme and is likely
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.340]   to turn her off and make her despise the subject.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.060]   So finding that individual balance to me would be the strategy to look for.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.380]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.380]   That's also me.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.340]   I don't like pressuring people to do things that they don't want to do.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:28.160]   And so when I sensed that she wasn't interested anymore, we did do Life of Fred twice, the
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.200]   books that are appropriate for her age and a bit older.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.580]   But then again, because she was looking at the story, the story was no longer novel.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.180]   So she lost interest.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.060]   I don't know if you know of any other books or websites that are, as you said, narrative
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.620]   based math.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.660]   I think Life of Fred is the best.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:52.260]   I have a complete Life of Fred collection from apples all the way up through trigonometry.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.180]   The only one I haven't gotten yet is calculus.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.060]   So that tells you how much I care about it.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:02.820]   I have purchased, I'm building a collection of every single book that Stanley Schmidt
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.980]   has written.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.300]   So I think it is the best.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:12.020]   And the neat thing about Life of Fred, I assign it to my children in addition to another math
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.020]   curriculum.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.860]   So I use two math curricula.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:20.820]   And Life of Fred generally is about, most lessons seem to be about 15 or 20 minutes.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:28.980]   And they're very, very doable, at least we're in the, I mean, my eldest is doing the beginner's
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.580]   algebra book now.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.940]   And still it's about 17 minutes, 20 minutes, something like that for him to work through
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.620]   the lesson, do the problems and be done with it.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.060]   So I think that would be my number one recommendation to you.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:46.140]   - Right, what is the second book or set of books that you're doing?
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.940]   - So you're gonna go, yeah, so the pathway goes, you start with apples and then you think
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.620]   you go through goldfish or ice cream or something like that.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.620]   Maybe it's ice cream.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.340]   And that's the elementary.
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:05.460]   Then you go to kidney, liver and mind shaft, and hopefully this is piquing the interest
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.700]   of somebody.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.220]   That's the middle school math is kidney, liver and mind shaft.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:15.140]   Then after that, you go into the decimals book and fractions.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.540]   Then after that, you go into the pre-algebra book.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:23.340]   And then there's pre-algebra zero with economics, pre-algebra one with physics and pre-algebra
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.300]   two with chemistry.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.420]   And that takes a child all the way through pre-algebra, which would be about normally
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.300]   in the US system, eighth grade math.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.860]   Then you go into the high school series and so then it's beginning algebra one, advanced
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.340]   algebra two, geometry and trigonometry.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.100]   And then from there into calculus and then into the advanced college math books.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:48.380]   He takes it all the way through a four-year undergraduate degree of mathematics.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.460]   So what you're looking for is if you've done the A through I or whatever it is, then you
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.140]   need to get kidney, liver and mind shaft.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:01.300]   - Heading back to school is a breeze and so are the savings at your local AmazonFresh
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.660]   grocery store.
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.260]   Our favorite class, lunch.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.460]   Plan, prep and pack in one convenient place.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.180]   Send their taste buds on a field trip with fresh favorites from easy, delicious meals
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.460]   to snacks that power study sessions.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:19.760]   Plus, save up to 50% on select prime member deals this back to school season.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.860]   Save big on back to school at your local AmazonFresh grocery store.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.380]   Find a store near you.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:31.100]   - Yeah, he does have on his website, he sort of, I don't remember where he stops, but he
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.140]   encourages parents not to move too fast.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.300]   Again, I don't know.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:41.580]   So that his point is that children's brains may not be ready for something.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.580]   And by trying to shoehorn them into that something, then as you said earlier, you can sort of
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.660]   poison them.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.220]   - So I think you just test it.
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:52.420]   So this is something I've tested myself and am testing.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:59.100]   I heard various people say, both Schmidt himself and a couple of other math teachers that I
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:03.540]   listen to, is they make a big point to say, don't do conceptual math too early.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.140]   So first of all, I would say conceptual math would start at about algebra.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.860]   Even pre-algebra is not particularly conceptual.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.500]   But so you can certainly go into the middle years of kidney, liver and mind shaft before
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.900]   needing to go farther.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:23.300]   But I tested it and I'm open to stopping, but I haven't seen that there's been any reason
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.300]   to stop.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:32.540]   So just for context, my almost 11 year old is doing algebra now and I haven't observed
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.580]   any problem with it.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:38.420]   So I simultaneously totally agree with the ideas that we should be careful.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.340]   I think we should be cautious of workbook math too early.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:46.420]   I think it's perfectly reasonable to not start any formal mathematics even until 10 or 11
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.260]   and start in like fifth grade.
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:53.640]   But I do think you should look at your actual daughter and see, and if she's not overwhelmed
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.660]   by it, then just keep going.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.340]   And then recognize that that's the power of narrative, is that you don't have to get every
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.780]   problem right.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.640]   The stories will start to help to convey the concepts.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.540]   And if she goes through it once and it's a little bit too advanced, but she comes back
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:15.180]   two years later, then it'll be easy for her and that's the benefit.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:20.780]   So we should go at the level that the child is capable of going and not unnecessarily
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.240]   hold her back nor unnecessarily push her too strong.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.240]   Got it.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   All right.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.580]   Thank you very much Joshua.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.900]   Let me just add one more thing.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.700]   I use myself as a meter.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:40.380]   I have a daughter that is just older than yours and I have basically a complaining meter
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.380]   that I use.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:47.480]   And so my daughter has everything that I present to her ever, she complains about it incessantly
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.120]   before we even start.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.520]   So I'm pretty immune to complaining, but I also listen to how much there is.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.260]   And we usually go through phases.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.260]   So I'll just use languages.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:02.220]   When I introduced my daughter to Spanish, well it was French, I introduced her to French
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.260]   and she hated every minute of it and complained nonstop.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.220]   So I did it in little bites here and there.
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:12.240]   And then as the complaining became less, then I increased the load a little bit.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.560]   Well, today she loves French, says French is her favorite lesson, French is her favorite
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.560]   subject.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.500]   So if she could just do nothing but French, that would just be happy, that would make
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.500]   her happy.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.600]   It's like, why do we have to do anything today except French?
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.380]   And there was just a year ago where she just complained nonstop and never wanted to do
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.760]   anything with French.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.900]   So I listened to the complaints and then I vary the amount of work based upon it.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.540]   So similarly, then after French, I moved on to German.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.240]   I said, okay, let's start German.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.420]   Complain, complain, complain.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.900]   I adjusted the content a little bit, complain, complain, complain.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.980]   And then I kind of tested a little bit and I realized, yeah, we're not making progress
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.980]   here.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:49.520]   So I went way back, stopped with the advanced stuff, went back to the beginning, built it
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.880]   up, and all the complaining dialed back to just a little bit of complaining.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:58.140]   And what I'm looking for with knowing her is I just want just a little bit of complaining,
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.560]   but I know I'm just going to press it forward.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.340]   And then pretty soon the complaining starts to disappear and then we ramp it up.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:08.160]   So that's an actual example, but that's, I think, what you're looking for, is you're
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.560]   not looking for tears.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.960]   You don't want tears.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.600]   But a little bit of complaining is a good metric to see where, okay, we're actually
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.780]   making progress here.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.780]   This is hard.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:17.780]   I don't love it.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   Okay, good.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.780]   We're right at the right area.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:26.440]   So then just swap in and out different things and use that kind of complaining meter to
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.920]   assess how you're doing and where you should be focused.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   - Makes sense.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   Thank you.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   - Yep.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   My pleasure.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.560]   All right, we go on to Timothy in Virginia.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.560]   Welcome, Timothy.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.560]   How can I serve you today?
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.560]   All right.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.560]   Timothy is gone.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   All right.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.560]   Let me pivot here.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:47.500]   Since Timothy dropped off, wait a second and see if he pops back on.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:52.400]   Let me read you a couple of written questions prepared.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.720]   The first written question or the first written is a comment that actually came in from a
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:03.420]   listener in response to my recent episode on Child Protective Services.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:07.400]   So a listener writes in and says, "Joshua, I just listened to your recent episode on
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:12.320]   how to protect yourself during a CPS investigation, Child Protective Services.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:17.400]   This episode resonated with me because a few years ago, my family was investigated several
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.680]   times by CPS over the course of about 18 months.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.340]   It was one of the most difficult personal trials we've ever faced and it nearly tore
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.120]   our family apart.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.400]   But thanks to God's divine intervention and the wisdom of some very good attorneys, we
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:37.580]   were able to successfully convince CPS to close their case.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.440]   Without going into any details of our case to maintain confidentiality, I'd like to
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:47.000]   share a few aspects of my experience that listeners should be aware of that were not
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   mentioned in the episode.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.460]   First and most important, in most states, there is a mandated reporter legislation that
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:04.960]   requires teachers, daycare workers, church staff, camp counselors, or anyone who interacts
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:11.280]   with children daily to report any suspected abuse to CPS.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:17.320]   Any bump, bruise, or scratch on your child could be interpreted by a teacher as suspected
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:24.320]   abuse, including minor injuries young children often sustain during normal play.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:29.920]   Secondly, in each case that was filed, the social worker interviewed my children at their
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:36.680]   school prior to interviewing us, without our knowledge or consent.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.000]   When they knocked on our door, they already had the testimony of our children as evidence
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.520]   against us.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:47.720]   My attorney informed me this is legal and standard practice in my state.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:53.340]   Thirdly, CPS reports are public records, and you have the right to obtain them as part
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.960]   of your legal defense strategy.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:01.900]   And lastly, CPS does serve the public good by protecting children experiencing abuse.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.840]   As I got to know the caseworkers, I began to appreciate how hard they work to ensure
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.600]   the well-being of children who have no one to look out for them at home.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.200]   It's a very tough job.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.920]   Whether or not you are being investigated for just cause, they deserve your respect
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.960]   and appreciation.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.440]   It's important to know that once you are under the gaze of CPS, it is highly likely that
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.300]   you will face multiple investigations.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:31.380]   To that end, I highly recommend installing surveillance cameras throughout your home.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:36.520]   This is something I did after the first CPS investigation, and from that point onward,
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:42.000]   I was able to provide video evidence to the caseworker for each incident.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.800]   I'm convinced this contributed significantly to ending their case.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.840]   We are doing much better today as a family, and we are so thankful.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:54.520]   There's more I could share about my story, but I prefer to keep that private.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.600]   I will say this.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:00.120]   You are absolutely right that CPS operates under a totally different legal structure
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.680]   than the police.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.420]   You really are guilty until proven innocent.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:10.640]   You need a good family law attorney, and you need to be cooperative and respectful to the
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.640]   caseworkers.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.400]   Thanks again for posting such a good episode.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.780]   Would you be willing to share this message with others?
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:22.480]   So this is a good email and a good outline.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.720]   I want to go through and just add a couple of comments to this.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:30.400]   I should have included, I thought about it, I was trying to decide how extensive to make
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.400]   the outline.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.720]   For the first two points, it is really important, so I want to emphasize them.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:40.060]   First, on the concept of a mandated reporter, this indeed is the fact.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:48.320]   You should assume that any person who is employed in some kind of capacity interacting with
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.680]   children is a mandated reporter.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:52:00.000]   So I would say the obvious ones are healthcare professionals, doctors, nurses, psychiatrists,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.400]   anybody like that, all educators, teachers, school counselors, daycare administrators,
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:15.580]   and then other clergy, usually a mandated reporter, so pastors and priests and rabbis,
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:20.540]   usually public servants, law enforcement, public safety officers.
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:25.940]   There might be other people, coaches, lawyers, things like that.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.280]   These are the types of occupations that are mandated reporters.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:36.760]   So if this mandated reporter sees or observes anything that could be construed as abuse
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   of any kind, then he or she legally is obligated to report it to the appropriate government
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:45.760]   officials.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.800]   And it's important that you know this.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:54.680]   And just from a defensive strategy perspective, it's important that you understand that if,
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   for example, let's say your child falls down, if you have children, and especially if you
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:05.480]   have boys, and if you allow your children to be boys, there's a decent chance that generally,
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:12.800]   normally, there's going to be bumps, bruises, cuts, lacerations, scrapes, things like that.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:18.400]   So if any of that is obvious, for example, on the face, you need to make certain that
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:26.080]   your child very clearly remembers what happened, happens, and that you say it.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:30.480]   So if your child fell down on his bicycle or fell out of a tree and scraped his face
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.880]   up, then you need to make certain that when you take your child to school, that your child
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.520]   tells the teacher, "I fell down and scraped my face."
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:43.240]   Obviously, the mandated reporter is going to ask and give a chance to talk about it,
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   but it's important to understand where injuries come from.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:54.040]   And normally speaking, if there's a perfectly normal and ordinary explanation for an injury,
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:57.800]   then that can minimize the risk of filing a report.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.800]   It is also important to have documentation of certain things.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:10.880]   So let's say one of your children gets injured, and you seek medical help, then it's important
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:17.160]   to make certain that you document with the physician, and ideally with your notes and
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.000]   everything, exactly what happened.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.080]   Because sometimes things might come back years later, and it's important that you have those
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:30.400]   written records and that the people involved, that there's contemporaneous evidence of what
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.760]   actually happened.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.860]   Think of it like a court case.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:38.760]   If you've ever watched an actual court case, I watched the Johnny Depp Amber Heard trial,
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:43.760]   much of it, when that was happening a couple years ago, and I found it so fascinating to
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.540]   just look at the importance of contemporaneous documentation, that if so-and-so was injured,
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:54.920]   then so-and-so went to the doctor, and in the doctor's notes, we can find this assessment.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.700]   We can find this clear evidence that was taken by the physician.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.280]   And so think about that and make certain that if there's an injury, that you document the
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:10.220]   injury in some way yourself, that you make records and contemporaneous records of it,
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:17.240]   in addition to, if you seek medical care, that the reason for the injury is documented
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.140]   and understood.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:28.280]   And if there's been some kind of weird thing happening, let's say that your child had a
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:34.120]   weird bruise, fell down and smacked his face on a rock and is bruised in some way that
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:40.040]   would be the kind of bruising that an abusive adult would cause, if an adult were abusing
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:45.360]   the child, then document it properly and just be aware of the fact that there are mandated
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.520]   reporters who, if they see that continually, will step in, as they should.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:55.420]   I think that those kinds of laws are appropriate, but you need to be aware of them.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:56:00.360]   The next point that the listener writes about is the fact that the social worker interviewed
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:07.560]   the children at their school without speaking to the parents.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.000]   This is indeed legal and it is common.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.800]   It's legal and common.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:19.880]   And I thought about talking about this, but I wasn't sure what to say about it, again,
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:24.640]   because we're kind of walking this fine line where I want abusive people, abusive adults
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:30.480]   to be found, to be caught, and to be prosecuted, and I want children to be put in safe situations.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.960]   So I thought, you know, what do you do?
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:40.680]   First of all, if you've done nothing wrong and are doing nothing wrong with your children,
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:46.660]   then probably there's no harm to the interview in the first place.
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.180]   When you're dealing with a normal situation and a normal child and something that has
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:59.480]   happened that has caused something to happen, then generally the explanation should make
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   sense.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:04.120]   I'm thinking here of an example where one of my boys fell out of a tree, fell out of
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.480]   a tree, fell on a rock underneath the tree.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:12.980]   The rock hit his stomach, knocked the wind out of him, and caused him to experience a
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.880]   lot of pain and have bruising.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:22.240]   Took him to the doctor, had a full checkup done, and go back to documentation, and, you
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.360]   know, we document, okay, here's the tree, here's the rock, here's where he fell from.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   Go to the doctor, explain, fell out of a tree, you know, about this high as best we can figure
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   out.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.360]   Here's what happened.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.960]   You know, it's documented.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:39.880]   If somebody, if in a normal situation, somebody came along and asked the child what happened,
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.520]   I fell out of a tree is a pretty obvious thing that wouldn't cause any harm.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:50.520]   Where I most worry about interviews is when children are very young or if children have
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:59.380]   diminished capacity and don't have the ability to, don't have the ability to clearly understand
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.940]   what is happening.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:05.940]   So here is a paragraph, I don't, I can't remember if I read this in the other one, but from
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:10.400]   Defending the Innocent for Child Protective Services, "The charges are going to dictate
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.200]   what steps to take next.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   Depending on the severity of the charges, this will dictate what you can and should
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.200]   do.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:20.520]   If the allegations include direct harm to a child, assault, neglect, you will have to
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.340]   let them," them being CPS, "see the child.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.620]   This does not mean that you have to allow CPS into your house.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.820]   Have them meet with the child on the front step briefly and in your presence and be sure
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:32.040]   to record the discussion.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.460]   Inform CPS that the meeting is being recorded.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:38.260]   Do not allow CPS to talk with the child alone, ever.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:41.620]   Child Protective Services will be able to make up evidence they need from the child's
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:44.980]   testimony and you will have no defense against it.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:50.180]   Children do not testify in court and the words they use are taken at face value, even though
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.800]   you can explain it.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.060]   That evidence will be used against you.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:58.060]   An example would be if they took the child to the car and asked, "Has mommy or daddy
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.020]   ever put something in your behind?"
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.820]   The child will answer, "Yes."
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:04.260]   "What was it?" will be the next question.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.900]   And of course the answer will be, "I don't know."
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:10.300]   Now you're losing your son and facing 15 years in prison because you used a rectal
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.740]   thermometer on a three-year-old and the child couldn't explain you were taking his temperature.
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:20.180]   So that's an example of the kind of miscommunications that can happen in an interview.
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:21.380]   So how do you handle this?
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:26.420]   Well, first, I think you just try to explain what's happening and talk to your children
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.220]   as best you can and explain what's happening.
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:37.300]   I don't think that in general it's appropriate to try to make specific, you know, to talk
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:41.300]   on and on about, "Well, here's what you do if you talk to a CPS agent," or something
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:45.140]   like that, unless you had a specific cause for concern.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.260]   So the example that I used was homeschooling.
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:52.540]   I know many people that homeschool in, I know some people who homeschool in countries where
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.700]   homeschooling is illegal.
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:56.860]   They know that they are breaking the law.
[00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:01.380]   They're breaking the law because the law is immoral and their conscience is clear doing
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.380]   it.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.860]   But because they know that they're doing something that is illegal, they have to take
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:10.580]   extra measures to instruct their children on how to keep their children out of problem
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.300]   and out of trouble.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.500]   So the parent will coach the child.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.980]   If you're interacting with somebody who's asking you these kinds of questions, this
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.340]   is what you say.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:24.060]   And so you give these answers and nothing more, and you don't talk to the person anymore
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.500]   about this subject.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:29.300]   I think that's appropriate and an appropriate amount of defense if you have a particular
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:35.580]   reason why you yourself might be being targeted in a culture where you face an adversarial
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.020]   government.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:45.500]   In general, it seems that it's more important just simply to make it understood about how
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:54.680]   to deal with people in general, and that that would be the appropriate way to go about it.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:02.780]   So there are a lot of predators in the world, and an immoral CPS agent who is pursuing a
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.760]   false case is only one of those predators.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:11.900]   So I think it's most important that we teach children, generally speaking, to avoid predators,
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:17.240]   and we teach them the specific tools and techniques of avoiding predators.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:24.060]   One of my big concerns is that our society has decided that for whatever reason, parents,
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.920]   especially parents who have their children in government schools, should expect that
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:35.400]   unknown strangers are going to talk to their children about matters including sex and sexuality.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.040]   This is flat-out evil.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:43.900]   It is absolutely evil that some stranger would come and talk to your child about matters
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.020]   relating to sex and sexuality.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.480]   I'm much more concerned about that than I am about CPS.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.800]   So I think it's appropriate that we teach our children that these are the conversations
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.740]   that you have with other people, these are the conversations you don't, similar to how
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:03.400]   we have a responsibility to teach our children to have complete and total control and autonomy
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:09.280]   over their bodies, to say, "Nobody touches you without your permission.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:15.740]   These are the behaviors and the things that people can't do to you.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.140]   People can't remove your clothes.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.340]   People can't touch you on your body here.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.680]   These are the people who are allowed to touch you."
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:27.340]   And so the appropriate way to do it is meeting mom or dad or a physician if we're in a doctor's
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.040]   office and mom or dad is with you.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.540]   And so being very proactive about teaching our children about abuse and teaching them
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:39.860]   about appropriate conversation boundaries, teaching them to avoid one-on-one conversations,
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.280]   I think is more important to protect them from the predators they're likely to face
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.580]   with teachers or administrators or other perverts that they're surrounded by rather than just
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:52.220]   worrying about CPS, but it naturally extends to that.
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.460]   I worry a little bit about how to do this well.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.500]   I don't know how to do it well.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.060]   I hate, for example, with the police conversations.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:03.900]   I wish we could go back to an era in which I could tell children, "Hey, if you're in
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.300]   trouble, go and find the policeman."
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:13.300]   I still want them to look for a policeman when a child is facing trouble.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.420]   But I also have to teach them to be careful and teach them how to not talk to the police
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.020]   in an appropriate circumstance.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.020]   So it's difficult.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.780]   I don't have perfect understanding of it.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:28.140]   But I think in general, we should teach our children, you don't have private conversations
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:34.420]   with people about really almost any, there's no reason for you to have private conversations
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.420]   with other people.
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.180]   When people start asking personal questions, personal questions about the family, that's
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.980]   an appropriate time to say, "I'll be happy to answer your questions when my mommy or
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:43.980]   daddy is with me."
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:49.060]   And I think in general, that's a good rule that is going to properly protect appropriate
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:56.060]   parents from legal risks of rogue government agents without endangering children who are
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.260]   genuinely in danger.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:04.660]   I really hate to try to insert uncertainty into a child's mind, but realistically, children
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:07.620]   are surrounded by lots of danger.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:12.740]   And so we need to appropriately teach them about the danger without inappropriately creating
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.880]   fear.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.460]   And the best pathway I know to do that is to do it very intentionally.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.060]   As parents, it's our responsibility to have children teach them about boundaries for their
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:27.580]   bodies, teach them about boundaries for conversations, teach them about the types of tools and tactics
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:32.260]   that perverts will use to try to engage with them, and then to answer their questions very
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.860]   honestly so that they're not out talking to strangers about things that strangers have
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.020]   no business being involved in.
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:45.780]   The next comment that the listener mentioned about was talking about the idea that, talking
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.940]   about getting the CPS reports and then putting cameras in place.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.380]   And that seems like a great idea.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:56.300]   I didn't think about that, but absolutely, I think that's a great idea.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:02.460]   And what I understood here from the email is that this listener put cameras inside the
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:08.420]   house, certainly not in private areas, I would assume, but within the public areas inside
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.420]   the house.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.620]   And so there was documentation of what was happening and what is happening inside of
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.660]   the house.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:18.340]   And so given the fact that a CPS investigation is probably a longer-term thing, and in this
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:24.300]   case it was multiple investigations, if you do have a reason for heightened concern, then
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:29.540]   putting in place a proactive strategy to create evidence that could be used in your defense
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.980]   is a smart idea.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.140]   I hope I've struck an appropriate tone with this.
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.660]   I don't want to strike a paranoid tone because I'm not paranoid and I don't think we should
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:43.220]   be paranoid, but we need to be cautious.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:47.660]   And so the main thing I wanted you to be aware of is exactly what this listener said and
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:52.860]   exactly what I said in that show, that when dealing with CPS, you are guilty until proven
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.980]   innocent.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:59.420]   So you will need to present the appropriate evidence to resolve the case.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:03.300]   So think about that and at least be aware of that.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:10.140]   So if CPS knocks on your door and you deal with that agent differently than how you would
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.940]   deal with an FBI agent knocking at your door, with an FBI agent knocking on your door, the
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.860]   answer is, "Hello, sir, why are you here?
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.140]   And can I have a business card?
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:24.140]   And I don't answer questions, I'm sorry, I understand you're doing your job and it's
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:29.700]   just an investigation, it's just a few questions, I don't answer questions, thank you very much."
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:35.100]   And then you would immediately contact a lawyer and you would only ever speak with the FBI
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:38.860]   in the presence of a lawyer, and you would only answer questions with that safeguard
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.780]   and only answer what you're legally compelled to answer.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.300]   That is not what you do when CPS is at your door.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:50.620]   If CPS is at your door, you need to answer enough questions to diffuse the situation.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:55.780]   I don't know the level of corruption of CPS in your country, but for good conversation,
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.600]   let's assume that it exists but is low.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.500]   So you want to give good answers, but not violate any of those things that I said, and
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.140]   then quickly get a lawyer to help you through the process.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.660]   Remember, the truth is always your best defense.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.260]   Don't abuse your children.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.180]   Protect your children from anybody who would abuse them.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.900]   This is your responsibility.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.340]   I care much more about that than I do care about CPS.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:26.100]   So you need to be a lion protecting your children against perverts and people who would abuse
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.840]   your children and would prey on them.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.060]   Teach your children self-defense.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.460]   Teach your children to trust their fear.
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:39.780]   I always go back to Gavin DeBecker's book called "The Gift of Fear," a good book for
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:45.120]   you to read, and teach your children to respect their perspectives.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.540]   Teach them to defend themselves.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:51.320]   I'm not just talking about punching, but having noisemakers and teaching them to talk to people.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:56.780]   Teach your children what to do if somebody tries to tell your children about a secret.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:01.740]   So your children should be trained that if so-and-so comes and says, "Hey, let's keep
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:07.460]   this a secret," that's an immediate time to go and talk to mommy and daddy, because that
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:14.660]   concept of secrecy has been abused over the years by many abusers.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:20.980]   Teach your children to deal with shame appropriately, not to hide it, but to confess it and speak
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:25.300]   to you about intimate, difficult things so that you can protect them from the predators
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.340]   and the perverts that surround them today.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.340]   All right.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.340]   Going on to a question from a listener.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.340]   "Hey, Joshua.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.540]   I seem to have terrible luck with being available for your Q&A times.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.620]   I'll chat again soon."
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.420]   I did have one question for the show, if you're able to work it in.
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:40.100]   "My partner and I have been receiving a little less than $200,000 a year for about three
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.320]   years now for the sale of our business.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.260]   We provided owner financing, and that note will pay off at the end of this year.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.820]   Prior to that, we ran the business and basically just drew whatever we wanted out of it when
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.460]   we needed cash.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:55.700]   Since the sale, we have basically been funding our life with the money that comes in and
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.180]   keeping our salaries completely separate.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:01.580]   We maintain a joint account for bill pays and things like that, but have historically
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.940]   kept our savings separate.
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.620]   We're in our mid-30s.
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:08.940]   Net worth together is just over $2 million, and I earn about $200,000 full-time, and my
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.860]   partner earns $120,000 part-time.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.980]   My question is, how would you recommend managing finances after the payments stop?
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:20.380]   And now that we do not enjoy a big cash slush fund from a profitable company that we ran,
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:23.620]   we've gotten pretty sloppy about doing things like budgeting or planning.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:27.500]   We'd be curious if you have any thoughts on how to transition into a more structured expense
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:32.140]   and budgeting system after not doing that for more than 10 years."
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.740]   So great question, and I do.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:41.620]   So very specifically, you don't need to budget so much as you need to put controls in place
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:45.540]   to make certain that you never overspend your income.
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:49.380]   So what would be an example of a perfect set of controls for you to put in place?
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.700]   Well, you would take your income, which would be your paychecks.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:58.380]   When you receive your paycheck on Friday, you would take it down to the bank.
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:59.820]   You would cash that paycheck.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:04.120]   You would put all of that physical cash in your pocket, and you would spend that.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.440]   And if you needed to buy something, you would spend it out of the physical currency that's
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.700]   in your wallet.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.660]   And if you ran out of currency in your wallet, you would stop buying things.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.940]   That would be the perfect set of controls.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:16.260]   Now obviously, none of us do that.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:19.500]   No one does that in today's world, but we should.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:23.740]   And if we're going to try to build a system, we want to get as close to that as possible.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:29.320]   And the point here is that budgeting is not so important as it is not overspending.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.100]   That's the basic thing.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.380]   And what people often think of when it comes to budgeting is they often think of some form
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:36.380]   of tracking.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.740]   Well, tracking is nice, but tracking is historic.
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.340]   Tracking means you can look back at the end of the month and you can figure out what you
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.620]   spent money on last month.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.640]   That's less important than proactive controls.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.780]   So the idea of budgeting is that you're going to sit down, you're going to figure out how
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:58.840]   much money is going to come in next month, you're going to put it all into various categories
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.580]   and buckets, and then you're going to take those categories and buckets and you're going
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.220]   to spend money out of them.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:09.940]   But a lot of times this doesn't happen for most people because they just simply do too
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:10.940]   much.
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:11.940]   They've got too many things.
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:14.620]   Who wants to sit around and categorize expenses?
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.620]   Now you can use various software systems and things that help you make your buckets fancier
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:21.820]   and automatically categorize your transactions.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.860]   I think that that's nice, but unnecessary.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.860]   What is the most necessary is that you not overspend.
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.200]   So let me explain to you how you do that.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.800]   Since you're not going to do the cash thing, you need to do the digital equivalent of that,
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.740]   which is to put your money into an account, a bank account, and then spend your money
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.720]   from that account.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.720]   The first thing that you want to avoid is the use of a credit card.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.720]   Why?
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.980]   Well, because a credit card makes it possible and easy for you to overspend by accident.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:57.840]   You just kind of accidentally spend a little bit more than you intended to, and now you
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.900]   have to pay back thousands of dollars more to the credit card bill.
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.560]   There are good reasons to use a credit card.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:11.180]   The most important one being the point of sale protection that you get for unauthorized
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:16.800]   expenses and fraud by using a credit card as compared to a debit card.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.240]   That protection is useful and valuable.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.720]   The problem with a debit card is not necessarily that you won't get your money back.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.320]   Generally, your debit card issuer gives you good protections against fraud, but that your
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.500]   bank account might be wiped out in the meantime, whereas with a credit card, you can go back
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.380]   and settle things and deal with it.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:42.120]   But I think you can fix this electronically and get rid of the risk of overspending.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:47.600]   So what I teach people to do is to set up a system, usually that involves at least two
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.460]   checking accounts, and one checking account is your bills-paying checking account.
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:55.120]   Another checking account is your spending checking account.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   So imagine this.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.440]   You have a paycheck that comes in.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.040]   There's $15,000 in the paycheck.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.960]   You take off the top the amount of money that you're going to save, go ahead and set aside
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   whatever percent.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.080]   Let's say you set aside $3,000 of it.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.160]   That gets automatically put to savings, and you're left with $12,000.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:17.160]   The $12,000 goes into checking account A. Checking account A is the account that you
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.340]   have your automatic bill pay set up.
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.920]   So all of your bills automatically draft to that checking account.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.400]   Then you're going to take whatever's left over.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.680]   Let's say you had $4,000 of bills, and you're left with $8,000.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:37.360]   So now you take $8,000 and make a transfer to checking account B. Checking account B
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:45.260]   is the card that you spend money from based upon your actual point-of-sale transactions.
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:49.020]   And the idea is I want you to be able to pop open an app on your phone, look in your checking
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:53.060]   account, see how much money is in there, and then if there's money in there, go ahead and
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.060]   spend it.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.420]   If there's not money in there, then stop spending money.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:00.660]   And I want your card to bounce if you try to spend money that you don't have in there.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:04.620]   And if you do that and just maintain a little buffer there, and you just say, "I never spend
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:10.580]   below $3,000," then pretty well you've solved the problem, and you've guaranteed that I'm
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:15.240]   not going to overspend, because I did my savings, and I just put the money from my income into
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.240]   the account.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.460]   I'm not going to overspend.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:20.700]   And then if you're just dealing with a small checking account that's just for expenses,
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:25.320]   then I think we can pretty well get rid of the worries about point-of-sale risk of a
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.860]   debit card versus a credit card.
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.500]   You're always going to run it as a credit card.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.500]   Don't put your pin in.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.580]   You're just going to run it as a credit card.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:37.100]   And if somebody wiped out your account, well, you just lost your spending money until you
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.100]   can replenish it.
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:46.960]   That's a very low risk as compared to the much higher risk of you just overspending
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.660]   because you always use a credit card.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.920]   So don't use credit cards.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.920]   Don't spend on them.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.280]   Too easy to overspend.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.800]   Spend on a debit card that has a spending account associated with it, and then just
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.800]   skip the budgeting.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.520]   If you're not into budgeting, skip it.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.920]   But if you do that system that I described, you won't ever overspend, and you will basically
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.400]   have accomplished the goal of budgeting.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.220]   You covered your bills with planning them out in advance, and all of your point-of-sale
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:11.520]   spending, the stuff that you do spontaneously, is all done with a card.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:16.780]   And then finally, whenever possible, use Apple Pay or Google Pay instead of actually running
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.940]   the actual card because that additionally helps to protect you from fraud.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.900]   So that would be my suggestion for you.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.620]   The idea being don't try to force yourself to be someone you're not.
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.740]   If you're not the kind of guy who sits around and makes spreadsheets for fun, don't try
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.940]   to become the kind of guy who's going to make spreadsheets and just force himself to do
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:31.940]   it.
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:35.080]   You want to be the kind of guy instead who puts in place a simple system that protects
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.080]   him against overspending.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.080]   That's it for today's Friday Q&A show.
