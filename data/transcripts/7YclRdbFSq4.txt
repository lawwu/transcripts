[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   All right.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Quick question.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Christine asks, when do you listen to podcast?
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.400]   For me, chores is a big one.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.600]   Cleaning dishes, cleaning the house, mowing the yard.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.880]   Great time to listen to either podcast or books on tape.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.880]   I go back and forth.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.880]   I treat those interchangeably.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   Driving.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.080]   So driving will be another time I'll do that.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.520]   The walk home from my kid's bus stop.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.600]   So I take my older two boys to the bus stop in the morning, about 15 minutes away.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.480]   So that walk home, I would consistently listen to things.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.560]   And then sometimes I would add onto that walk.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.240]   So I'd make it a little bit longer than 15 minutes on the way home.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.560]   So that's when I'm listening to the podcast.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.280]   Not all the time, but during times when my mind would otherwise be bored.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.920]   The exception to that, of course, is listening to deep questions.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.200]   That you want to listen to as soon as it comes out as many times as you can fit into your
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.400]   week.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.260]   (upbeat music)
