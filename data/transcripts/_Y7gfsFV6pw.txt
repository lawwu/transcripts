[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.760]   - Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.360]   We have a full week of questions on the docket ready to go
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.260]   and we begin the week with a very specific Bible question
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.720]   from Scott in Springfield, Illinois,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.920]   although he sent it to us in clouded and veiled terms.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.520]   Scott writes in, "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.220]   "I'm struggling with finding the purpose
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880]   "of Mark 14, verses 51 to 52.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.720]   "I've asked some people around me and looked online,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.360]   "but I can't seem to find an answer.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.420]   "For what reason was this stated here?
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.300]   "Surely it was stated here for a reason.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.560]   "What is that reason, Pastor John?"
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.560]   - Well, nobody knows what we're talking about
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.480]   until we read it, right? (laughs)
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.240]   So let me put these two verses in context.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.080]   So here we are at Mark 14, and I'll read 46 following.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.380]   They laid hands on Jesus and seized him.
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.680]   So this is in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.600]   But one of those who stood by drew his sword
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.440]   and struck the servant of the high priest
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.640]   and cut off his ear.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.680]   And Jesus said to them,
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.160]   "Have you come out against a robber
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.780]   "with swords and clubs to capture me?
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260]   "Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching,
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.440]   "and you did not seize me.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.120]   "But the scriptures must be fulfilled."
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.200]   And they all left him and fled.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.120]   And then here come the two verses he's asking about.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.880]   "And a young man followed him
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.480]   "with nothing but a linen cloth about his body,
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.440]   "and they seized."
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.600]   And that's the same word for Jesus being seized.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.440]   I'll come back to that.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.900]   They seized him.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.580]   But he left the linen cloth and fled.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.880]   That's the same word used for the others who fled, naked.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880]   And he wants to know what is with this guy?
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.720]   Who is he?
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.600]   Why is he there?
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.320]   We know nothing about this man's identity.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.200]   All guesses are guesses. (laughs)
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.920]   Some guess Mark himself.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.640]   Some guess the rich young ruler.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.760]   Some guess the angel who showed up
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.440]   as a "young man in the tomb."
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   Some say Joseph of Arimathea
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.320]   because he wrapped Jesus in a linen garment,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.940]   and so he has some symbolic connection.
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.560]   And all the guesses are guesses,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.440]   and I don't find any of the links
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.960]   with those guesses anywhere near compelling.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.580]   So I could never preach from any of those
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.980]   because I wouldn't have any authority to preach.
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.200]   There's just not enough clues.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.720]   So here's the first lesson, I would say.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.840]   Possible symbolic connections,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.680]   linen, youth, nakedness, fear and fleeing,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.480]   all of those symbolic possible connections
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   need enough signs of intentionality by the author,
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.240]   some evidences of intentionality by the author
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.040]   to make the connections look anything more than incidental
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.120]   rather than being significant.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.720]   And so look for the evidences by all means.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.600]   If you can find good clues and solid evidences
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.880]   that something symbolic is being done here
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.040]   with linen or nakedness or fear or whatever,
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.480]   go for it, find it,
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.120]   and then try to make it compelling to people around you.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.360]   But I don't see any of that myself yet.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.540]   I'm open to seeing it,
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.640]   but I read a couple of commentaries.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.360]   They threw out all kinds of possibilities
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   over the history of the church,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.920]   and no, I don't think so.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.480]   So what do we do with it then?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.320]   I mean, do we just say,
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.140]   oh, meaningless in the context here?
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.980]   No, we don't.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.760]   We see what significance it can have
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.560]   in its immediate context
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.360]   by how it relates to what's going on.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.840]   And I think there is some pretty profound
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.520]   and significant stuff going on
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.240]   to which this verse makes significant contributions.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.520]   So the details of this story at this point,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.760]   I would say communicate that there was incredible tension
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.880]   and fear and anger and a crisis in the air.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.480]   You don't lunge at somebody with a sword
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.780]   and cut off their ear
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.440]   unless there is a heart-thumping tension
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   and anger and fear and mob explosiveness in the air here.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.840]   We need to get back into that
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.320]   and let just the sheer narration of the facts
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.800]   make us feel some of what must have been going on there.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.360]   I mean, these soldiers at any moment
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.720]   could have and probably would have
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.800]   simply overwhelmed and killed
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.880]   every last one of those disciples at that lunge
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   if Jesus hadn't interceded on behalf of the wounded slave.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.600]   That's one thing to see.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.040]   Second is the aim of this text seems to be to show
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   that Jesus is remarkably poised and innocent,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.680]   and in a sense, in charge.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.000]   He says, "What, day after day I was with you in the temple?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.920]   "You didn't seize me there?"
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.160]   I mean, this is a very composed man
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.860]   in the face of the kind of heart-thumping tension
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.880]   there must have been.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.800]   And the third thing is that the text seems to aim
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   at the fact that everybody is forsaking Jesus.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.040]   They all, to fulfill the scriptures it says,
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.440]   fled and left him alone.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.880]   So even though that's a massive failure from one angle,
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.960]   it's totally according to plan.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.840]   That's the point of saying it was to fulfill scripture.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.360]   So God is not fumbling the ball here at all.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   Jesus is not out of control.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.560]   Everything is moving according to plan.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   And the fourth aim I see in the details of this text,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.080]   in other words, what is the author trying to communicate,
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   is that they were all so scared, so terrified,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.200]   they ran away, every one of them, all of them.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.500]   It says, "But let the scriptures be fulfilled," verse 50,
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.280]   "and they all left him and fled."
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.320]   I mean, just picture it.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.720]   Here he is, the one they've been with for three years,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.120]   and they just, all of them run away,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.320]   and that's probably because at any moment they saw,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.480]   we're about to be killed, we're about to be arrested
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.840]   because Peter, can't you control yourself,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.840]   Peter has just cut off the ear of one of their servants.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.920]   So they were running away and fleeing.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.800]   Now, at that point, we read,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.320]   "And a young man followed him with nothing
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.000]   "but a linen cloth about his body,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.820]   "and they seized him."
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.700]   Now, that's the only record we have
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.120]   of anybody but Jesus being seized.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.440]   And so one of the functions it has is,
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.300]   they were gonna seize him.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.680]   They were about to seize the apostles,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.720]   they were gonna take them.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.500]   And this man was evidently slow to go,
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.300]   or maybe he was too close to one of the soldiers
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.600]   as the others got free and ran into the woods,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.380]   he was a little too slow and they seized him.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.960]   And then verse 52, "But he left the linen cloth
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.880]   "and he fled naked."
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.160]   So it seems to me that what we have here
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.800]   is a flesh and blood illustration
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.480]   of what the apostles experienced in the terror of that night
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.120]   and in two ways.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.460]   One is that the man was seized,
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.040]   nobody else but Jesus was seized,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.280]   but this man was, so all of them probably saw this coming.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.200]   In other words, the soldiers were making their move,
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.760]   getting ready to arrest them all,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.800]   they bolted into the dark,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.480]   and so we see how terrified they were
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.320]   because this man was seized
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.600]   the way they were all going to be seized.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.120]   And the second thing is that he left his garment
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.700]   and ran away naked.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.160]   Now, I don't think the question we should ask at all
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   is why didn't he have on any underwear?
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.760]   That's just, I don't think we're going there,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.320]   that's just not the point.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.040]   Surely the point is mainly he was so terrified
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.400]   that he would rather be running naked in the woods
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.840]   than be arrested with Jesus.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.320]   That's how terrifying the moment was.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   Better to lose his reputation than be dead with Jesus.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.640]   That's how terrifying it was.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   So it seems to me as seemingly surprising
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.880]   as the appearance of this young man was in Mark,
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.600]   his presence is not meaningless and it's not insignificant,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.640]   and we don't need to resort to speculations
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.380]   about his identity or the symbolism of the linen
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.120]   or the nakedness to see why he's mentioned.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.120]   He is a concrete, vivid example of the terror
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.600]   they all felt and the completeness
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.900]   with which the scriptures were fulfilled
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.140]   that they would all flee.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.080]   That's a wonderfully helpful hermeneutical lesson
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.760]   from a rather obscure passage.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.880]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.840]   and thank you, Scott, for the question.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.040]   Well, our motto around here at Desiring God is this,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.860]   God is most glorified in us
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.800]   when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.100]   And tomorrow a listener named Kent wants to know
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.880]   why we don't say Christ is most glorified in us
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.040]   when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.760]   Why is Christ not more central in our motto?
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.720]   It's a fair question,
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.440]   and we will put Pastor John on the hot seat.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.800]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
