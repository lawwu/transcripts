[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   that great chapter, most of which we read at the beginning. The 15th chapter of Paul's
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.240]   first epistle to the Corinthians. Looking particularly at verse 17. The 17th verse
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.480]   in the 15th chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians. And if Christ be not raised,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:38.400]   your faith is vain. Ye are yet in your sins. And if Christ be not raised, your faith is
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   vain. You are yet in your sins. Now this is one of those great and outstanding
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:00.880]   chapters in the Bible. A chapter with which most people are familiar. A chapter which
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.240]   is customarily read at a funeral, on the occasion of a burial, and therefore I say a chapter
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.120]   that is more or less familiar. And yet I sometimes have a feeling that our very familiarity with
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:26.880]   this great chapter is a danger in and of itself. That applies to all such chapters in the Bible.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.120]   To certain Psalms, like the 23rd Psalm and so on, we are so familiar with them that we
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.960]   rarely never stop to look at them or to consider them. And therefore have never realized exactly
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.000]   what they say. There's another thing about this chapter which
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.320]   always seems to me to make it, to constitute a danger in connection with it, and that is
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:02.240]   the magnificence of the style of the writing. The eloquence of the words, the balanced periods,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.720]   the questions and answers. The apostle undoubtedly rose here to one of the great heights of eloquence
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.080]   to which he rises in many places in many of his epistles. And there is something about
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.960]   this chapter which is so noble and so moving, so profound, so eloquent, that I say the danger
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:36.360]   is that we are so moved and charmed and captivated by the very movement of the words that we
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.000]   never stop to think what he is writing about, nor what he is saying. We can, it is possible
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.640]   for us, so to enjoy this as literature, as to miss its message and to miss its entire
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.240]   point and purpose. Therefore I do feel that it's of great importance always that we should
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.760]   ask ourselves before we begin to consider it as a whole or in any one of its particular
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.720]   statements as to what indeed is the object of the letter, of this particular chapter
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.600]   in particular. Another thing that sometimes seems to me to
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.080]   constitute a kind of snare to many is that they become so lost in the details of the
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.120]   apostle's argument, particularly that section in which he deals with this point, with what
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.400]   body do they come, how shall the dead be raised up, and this wonderful argument about the
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.600]   different types of seed and the different types of flesh, and so on. People become so
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.280]   immersed and lost in the very detail of the argument that they forget the whole run of
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.120]   the argument. Well now, to fall into any one of those traps, of course, is a tragedy, because
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.520]   it means that we have missed the whole object which the apostle had in mind. Why did he
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.400]   write this chapter? Well, the answer is, it's an argument. And however much we may enjoy
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.800]   the language and the diction and the periods and the movement, we must never lose sight
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.520]   of the fact that Paul, when he wrote this chapter, was not sitting down to write a masterpiece
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   of literature. He was writing because he had to write in a way. There was a problem. There
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.360]   were certain people in the church at Corinth who said that the resurrection was already
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.680]   past. Others said that there was no such thing as resurrection. And it was in order to deal
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.400]   with that terribly dangerous situation that the apostle wrote this particular chapter.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.200]   Therefore, I say, whatever we may feel about it, if we haven't grasped the argument of
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.920]   the chapter, well then we have at any rate missed the apostle's primary object. It's
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.920]   an argument. It's reasoning. It's logic. He puts up positions and he deals with them.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.960]   And then he brings his argument to its mighty conclusion.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.240]   Now therefore, the great question which we have to face is this. What exactly then is
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.560]   the apostle teaching here? And it seems to me we can do nothing better than to try to
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:38.320]   summarize the main argument of the entire chapter. You will find that in particular
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.720]   verses, it's here in this verse that we are looking at particularly, the 17th verse.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.920]   But I say it's a good thing to have the whole argument in our minds. What's he doing here?
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:58.160]   What's he asserting? Well the first thing is this. He is concerned to emphasize the
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:08.880]   literal, physical resurrection, both of the Lord Jesus Christ and of all of us. The resurrection
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.720]   of the Lord Jesus Christ as a fact which has already taken place. Now you notice that I'm
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:24.600]   putting my emphasis upon the literal, physical resurrection. In other words, the apostle
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.440]   was not here setting out to tell these Corinthians that there's a wonderful principle of renewal
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.600]   in life. Isn't it a wonderful thing that every year after the winter with all its deadness,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.360]   the spring comes along, everything is renewed again. And therefore let us be hopeful. Things
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.960]   are never quite as bad as we think they are. There's a principle of renewal in the whole
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.760]   of life. Now there are many who interpret the resurrection to mean that. That isn't
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   what the apostle had in mind at all. Neither is he just telling them here that the Lord
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:13.680]   Jesus Christ still influences them and still influences the world as a memory, his great
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.360]   teaching, his example and so on. There are many who think of the resurrection like that.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.600]   But it's just the persistence of the teaching and the influence of Jesus of Nazareth. He
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.320]   being dead they say, yet speaketh. And that can be said of many great men and many great
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.480]   teachers in the world. They leave an abiding kind of influence. And that's their understanding
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.880]   of resurrection. That isn't the thing the apostle is teaching. Neither does it even
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:51.280]   mean this, that the Lord Jesus Christ is still alive. Of course it does mean that. My point
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.480]   is that that isn't the thing that the apostle was emphasizing. But there are many who interpret
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.400]   the resurrection like that. They say, the Lord Jesus Christ was put to death upon the
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.000]   cross by cruel men. And he died and was buried in a grave. But it's all right. They say
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.240]   he's still alive, he's still there in the spiritual realm. And they say he can help
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.880]   you from that spiritual realm. They may believe or may not believe that others also in the
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.680]   spiritual realm can help us, as the spiritists do. But that is the teaching of many, that
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.440]   the Lord Jesus Christ, who was crucified, died, and buried, is still alive there in
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.120]   that realm and is influencing his people and can help you. So you can pray to him and he
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:46.720]   will give you the aid that you need. Now while that is absolutely true, the point I'm emphasizing
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:55.680]   is that the apostle was not concerned just to say that. What he was concerned to say
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:04.240]   was this, that the Lord Jesus Christ, who was crucified and whose body was taken down
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:13.880]   from the cross and was buried in a grave, literally rose out of the grave in that body.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.160]   He's arguing about the empty grave. Not the mere persistence of Jesus, but that he
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:27.640]   rose literally in his body, out from among the dead and out of the grave. Now there is
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:34.840]   no question about this at all. You take the first section of the chapter, which I didn't
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:42.080]   read simply because of time, but the whole point of that first section is just to prove
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.880]   this literal, physical resurrection. He puts it as a statement like this, that he was buried
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:57.240]   and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures, and that he was seen. Seen.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.360]   Not that Cephas felt his influence, but he was seen of him. Then of the twelve, after
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.680]   that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain unto
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.080]   this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that he was seen of James, then of all
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:21.760]   the apostles, and last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.560]   Now there is no meaning in that, there is no sense in that at all, if the apostle thinks
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.240]   of resurrection merely in terms of the persistence of the Lord Jesus Christ beyond the grave
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.480]   in the spiritual realm. No, no, his whole point is that he came out in the body out
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:46.240]   of the grave, there was an empty grave, and therefore this is the thing that he would
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:53.080]   have these people take hold of. But of course, we've got further proof. All that mighty
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:01.640]   argument starting at verse 35, but some men will say, "How are the dead raised up?"
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.760]   There is no point in that argument at all, unless the apostle means literal, physical
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.480]   resurrection. You see, there were some people who were in difficulties about that in Corinth.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.520]   They said, "Now it's all very well to talk about this literal, physical resurrection,
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.600]   but how does it happen? What sort of a body do we rise in?" And the apostle takes all
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.320]   this time to answer the question. He shows the difference between the corruptible and
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:33.440]   the incorruptible, the natural and the spiritual, and so on, all of which is dealing with a
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:43.520]   body, a literal body, not a persistence in spirit, but the actual body being raised.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:50.240]   Now that is the essential teaching, not only of this particular chapter, but of the whole
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.480]   of the teaching of the New Testament. I trust, therefore, that we are all perfectly clear
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:07.680]   about that. The apostle's argument is that the Lord Jesus Christ arose out of the grave
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:14.040]   in his body. It was a changed body, it was a glorified body, but he arose in the same
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:21.640]   body though it was changed, and the same is going to happen to us. And there is this great
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.920]   argument as to how that happens. We don't understand it, but we do believe that the
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:34.000]   same is going to happen to us. Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, but in
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.800]   our changed, glorified bodies, we shall, as I shall show you in a moment. But there's
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.560]   the first step. And if we are not clear about that, of course, there is no point in our
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:55.840]   proceeding. We are concerned about this great, literal, physical resurrection.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.680]   Now that brings me to my second principle, which the apostle enunciates, is this, that
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:13.360]   to believe in this literal, physical resurrection is absolutely essential to the Christian position.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:20.880]   Now this is to me the whole point, the most important point of all. As I understand the
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.280]   apostle's argument, you cannot be a true Christian unless you believe in the literal,
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.520]   physical resurrection. Now where does he say it? Well, let me quote some of the verses
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:40.120]   again. Listen to verse 14. "If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:48.120]   your faith is also vain, empty, useless. If Christ isn't risen from the dead," says
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.320]   Paul, "well, all I've preached and all the other apostles have preached is nonsense.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.080]   It's empty, it's vanity, it's foolish, there's nothing in it. And your faith is
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   equally vain and empty and foolish." Take him again in verse 15. "Yea, and we
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.560]   have found false witnesses of God." If Christ hasn't literally risen from the grave in the
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:18.640]   body, he says, "We are liars, because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:25.600]   whom he raised not up, if it so be that the dead rise not." If there is no such thing
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.520]   as the rising of the dead, literally, physically, says Paul, well then this thing hasn't happened.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.200]   If it can't happen, it hasn't happened, and then we, by saying that it had happened,
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.440]   we're liars. So you see, that was a vital part of the Christian message. And I say you
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.560]   cannot be a Christian unless you believe this. But you've got it also in verses 18 and
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:54.760]   19. "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. And then if in this
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:05.680]   life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:15.800]   Now then I say this is important. This is absolutely a vital part of our Christian position.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.640]   It's not a matter of indifference. And of course I'm emphasizing this because you will
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.160]   find that there is a great deal of teaching at the present time which says that these
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.840]   things are indifferent. But it doesn't matter whether you believe this or not. There are
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:38.520]   prominent teachers who teach that regularly. They preach a kind of persistence, either
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:44.080]   of the influence of Christ's teaching, or that Christ, as I say, persists in the spiritual
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.240]   realm and can still help us. But they do not believe in the literal physical resurrection.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:57.880]   Let me give you one example. One of the theologians that influences more than anybody else the
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.880]   thinking of theologians and writers in this country today is Professor Emil Brunner of
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:10.160]   Switzerland. Professor Emil Brunner denies the literal physical resurrection. As he denies
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:16.400]   the virgin birth, he denies this. He believes in an influence of Christ, but he doesn't
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   believe in the literal physical resurrection. And the argument is that these things are
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.600]   indifferent. It doesn't matter whether you believe them or not. But surely the apostle
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.200]   would never have written this chapter if it was a matter of indifference. He would never
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.600]   have taken up his pen at this point. Why? Well, because he, as he tells us, and the
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:46.840]   other apostles, were primarily witnesses to the resurrection. That was their message.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.120]   You read the book of the Acts of the Apostles and you'll find that they went and preached
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.920]   Jesus and the resurrection. That was their message. That was the thing which they testified
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.560]   to. You will read that they gave great witness to the resurrection in the power of the Holy
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:10.760]   Ghost. So that this is obviously something which is quite basic and central to the apostles'
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:17.240]   message and to their whole testimony. And therefore he argues that if there is no such
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:24.240]   thing as this, well then, their whole message is a lie, they are false witnesses of God,
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   and the faith which these people have exercised in the message is something which is entirely
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:36.040]   misleading. Now then, it behoves us to examine ourselves
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   in the light of this. Is this vital and central and essential to our position? Do we realize
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:55.920]   its centrality and its all-important? There is no true Christian faith apart from this.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.840]   And therefore I say we must realize increasingly that it isn't our understanding that matters.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.120]   It isn't what we think or don't think. We have to base our position upon the apostolic
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:14.440]   teaching. The Church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. If we don't
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:20.440]   accept their testimony, we have no position at all. What made Paul an apostle was that
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:27.520]   he could witness to the resurrection, that Christ had literally risen from the grave
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:33.760]   in the body, that the grave was empty, as we see described in detail in the various
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.120]   Gospels. Very well then, let me go on to answer another
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:44.200]   question which obviously arises after the last proposition. Why is it essential to believe
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:56.160]   this? Why must we believe in this literal fact that the Lord Jesus Christ arose out
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:03.400]   of the grave in his body, leaving an empty grave? Well, the answers are given here in
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:11.640]   this chapter. The first reason why we must believe it is this. It is, of course, finally,
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:20.880]   the ultimate proof of the fact that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God. We can't stay
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:27.760]   with that this morning, but it's something that is emphasized everywhere in the Scriptures.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:35.160]   It was the resurrection that finally convinced even the disciples themselves. They were shaken
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:42.360]   badly by his crucifixion. It was the resurrection that convinced them. If we'd got nothing but
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:48.680]   the story of Thomas, it would be enough. Thomas said, "I won't believe it until I see him
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.840]   and can put my finger into the marks and the imprints of the nails and thrust my hand into
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:20:03.160]   his side. I can't believe it." When he saw him, he fell at his feet crying, "My Lord
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:12.160]   and my God." "Oh yes," says the Apostle Paul in writing to the Romans, "he was born of
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:18.440]   the seed of David according to the flesh, but declared to be the Son of God with power
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.760]   according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead." This is the
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:33.120]   thing that proclaims him to be the Son of God. He is the firstborn from among the dead.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:42.280]   He is the firstfruits of them that slept. This is the final, trenching, absolute proof
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:51.520]   that he is, I say, the eternal Son of God. And if he had not risen from the grave, it
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.120]   is absolutely certain there would never have been a Christian church. He would never have
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:02.480]   been preached as the Savior of the world and the Lord of the universe, never. There would
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:10.080]   have been no message. This is what gave being to the church, because it is a proof of the
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:20.400]   fact that he is the Son of God. Very well, the second thing is this. It shows, as nothing
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:27.920]   else in a sense shows, the purpose of his death and of his dying. Now that is why I
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:34.520]   take this particular verse. You notice how he puts it, "If Christ be not raised, your
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:46.200]   faith is vain. Yet you are still in your sins." If this message isn't true, says the Apostle,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:53.080]   "Well, you are still in your sins." Now what does he mean by that? Well, there's
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:22:01.640]   only one answer. The object of his death, then, was clearly and patently to deal with
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:08.920]   our sins. Because if this isn't true, we are yet in our sins. If this is true, we are
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:15.040]   not in our sins. Well, why did he die? Well, he died in order to deal with the problem
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   of our sins. We are all born in sin, we are all shaped in iniquity, we all sin and we
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:29.400]   are in our sins. And what we need is to be delivered out of our sins, because while we
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:35.080]   are in our sins, we are under the wrath of God. We are under the condemnation of the
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:42.320]   law of God. And we go to perdition, we perish. We need to be delivered out of our sins. How
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:49.080]   does it happen? Well, according to the Apostle, it happens by means of his death and resurrection.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:59.760]   So the whole purpose, the whole object of his dying was to deliver us out of our sins.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:07.240]   Now the argument, of course, is a tremendous one. We can look at it like this, if you like.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:13.480]   You start with the fact of the resurrection and you say, well, obviously in the light
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:20.760]   of this, this person, Jesus of Nazareth, was the Son of God. Very well, that at once raises
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:29.720]   this question. If Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, why did he ever die? Why was he
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:35.760]   ever crucified in weakness? Obviously, if he was the Son of God, he could have avoided
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.840]   it. He could easily have delivered himself and could have escaped. Why did he die if
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:50.680]   he was the Son of God? There is only one answer. He died for our sins. The Apostle has already
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.840]   said it in the third verse. "For I delivered unto you first of all"—first in importance,
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.800]   as the Revised Standard Version rightly translates it—"I delivered unto you first of all that
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:12.760]   which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures."
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.920]   So you see how vitally important this is. If these things are not facts, if these things
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:25.000]   are not true, well then, we are yet in our sins. There is no deliverance. But if these
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.080]   things are true, he has dealt with our sins, he has died for our sins, and we are delivered
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:37.400]   out of our sins. Therefore we cannot regard these things as matters of indifference. The
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.000]   Apostle has already started the whole chapter by saying that. Listen to him. "Moreover,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:49.160]   brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:58.560]   and wherein ye stand, by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:06.600]   unto you, unless ye have believed in vain." If we don't hold these things and stand in
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:13.280]   them and rely utterly upon them, well then, we are not saved. Because we are saved by
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.840]   these things, it is by doing these things that he saves us.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:26.040]   So there is another very good reason. It is here we see clearly the purpose of his death.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:35.520]   But let us go on. The next step is this one. The resurrection is the proof absolute that
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:45.000]   his death really has dealt with our sins. Now that works like this, doesn't it? If
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:56.280]   he had not risen from the dead, would it not be quite clear that even he himself was not
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:03.840]   big enough and great enough and strong enough to bear our sins? Our sins were laid upon
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:10.120]   him. He took them upon himself. And it was because of them that he died. They caused
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:18.320]   his death. Ah yes, but if he had remained in the grave, if he hadn't risen, how should
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:24.000]   we know that his action was sufficient? We wouldn't know that. We would have to come
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.480]   to the conclusion that the load of our sins and of our guilt was even too much for him,
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:37.660]   though he was the Son of God, and that it had killed him that he was defeated by it.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:44.120]   But his resurrection gives us the answer. And the apostle, you see, turns in triumph
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.920]   and says, "But now is Christ risen from the dead?" And what do I know in the light
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:59.680]   of that? Well, I know this, that his sacrifice was sufficient, that the law of God has been
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:08.040]   satisfied, that God is satisfied, that the everlasting Father has said, "It is enough.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:16.840]   He has borne the penalty. He can rise again." And in his rising he proclaims that his oblation
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:23.400]   was sufficient, his atonement is complete, that all the demands of law and of God have
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:31.000]   been satisfied. By raising him again from the dead, God is publicly announcing and proclaiming
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.600]   that our sins have been covered, have been dealt with once and forever.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:45.800]   Now this apostle puts all that in one verse. In the epistle to the Romans, chapter 4, verse
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:54.960]   25, "Who was delivered for our offenses and raised again for our justification." That's
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.520]   what it means. So the great meaning of this resurrection
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:08.520]   morning is just this. It is God's public pronouncement that the work of his Son upon
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:17.880]   the cross, the sacrifice, the bearing of sins, has done the work which it was meant to do.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:27.160]   The justice, the righteousness, the honor of God is satisfied. And for that reason,
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   God can now forgive freely the sins of all who believe in and trust and rely only upon
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.840]   the Lord Jesus Christ and his atoning death and resurrection.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:50.360]   That's what he proclaims. It's a tremendous assertion that the law has been satisfied.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:57.640]   There is nothing now that stands between any believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and God
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:06.160]   as his heavenly Father. It is enough. It has been done. It is his triumph over all the
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:14.000]   powers that were set against him. And that then leads me to the next, which
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:24.240]   is a more personal one for us. The resurrection of Jesus Christ, as Paul now goes on to show,
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:36.320]   is also proof positive that we also shall rise in the body and that therefore our redemption
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:43.120]   is ultimately and finally going to be complete. Now this is how he puts it, as you remember.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.960]   He says that Christ is the firstfruits. You notice he says, "As in Adam all die, even
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:57.080]   so in Christ shall all be made alive, but every man in his own order. Christ the firstfruits,
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:07.840]   afterward they that are Christ's at his coming." Now this is a great part of the argument of
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:13.800]   the entire chapter, as you noticed. These Corinthians were having a difficult time.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.080]   They were being persecuted and were being tried. They were very discouraged. They were
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.280]   laboring in the Lord's service, many of them, and nothing seemed to be happening, and they
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.560]   wondered what was ahead of them. And there were these people who were saying, "There
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.080]   is no such thing as resurrection. You are suffering all this in this life as Christians,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.920]   and when you die, you die. That's the end of it. Is it worth it? Shall we go on with
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:45.840]   it?" Listen, says Paul. As heroes, we are going to rise. Our redemption
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:51.120]   is going to be complete. What is complete redemption? Well, you can look at it like
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:31:01.840]   this. When man fell in the garden of Eden, he fell completely. What I mean is this. He
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:09.640]   not only fell in a spiritual sense, he fell in his body. The fall and the sin of men affected
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:20.520]   the whole man, spirit, soul, and body. We must get hold of that. Our bodies even now
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:27.920]   are not what the body of Adam was before he fell. That body of Adam was absolutely perfect.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.440]   There was no blemish in it. There was no disease. There was no taint. There was nothing wrong
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.840]   at all. Man was made absolutely perfect in the image of God, and he was perfect in every
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:45.640]   respect. And when he fell, he fell in every respect. Even the body fell. Hence our aches
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:53.360]   and pains. Hence our frailty. Hence our weaknesses. Hence our being subject to diseases. Hence
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:32:00.880]   degeneration and decay and pollution and all the rest of it. Very well. If the work of
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:06.280]   the Lord Jesus Christ is a complete work of redemption, well, then my whole man must be
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.520]   saved. My body as well as my spirit and my soul. And the argument here is that it's going
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:21.840]   to happen. Our position as Christians at the moment is this. We are already saved in a
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:31.520]   spiritual sense. Never lose sight of that. You are saved in a spiritual sense now if
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.680]   you're a Christian as you'll ever be. You have been quickened with Christ. You have
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:43.640]   been raised with Christ. You are seated in the heavenly places with Christ now. That's
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:49.400]   spiritual. Yes, but you are still here in the body, and that's why you have the conflict
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:55.440]   with sin, the law in your members, the thing that drags you down. That in me, says Paul,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.480]   that is to say in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. That's the body. Spiritually I'm
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.800]   saved in Christ. Yes, but my body is still here, and it drags me down, and I fail, and
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:13.760]   I want to be delivered. It's all right, says Paul, you shall be delivered. Christ
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:20.120]   the firstfruits. Afterward, them also that are Christ's. At that final resurrection,
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.920]   your body is going to be saved. It shall be perfected. It shall be changed. It shall be
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.920]   glorified. Read the great argument for yourselves again. Flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.440]   kingdom of God, neither can corruption put on incorruption. Well, how do you get out
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.600]   of it, says someone? Well, here it is. This corruptible must put on incorruption, and
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:47.560]   this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.640]   and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:03.600]   is written, "Death, even death, is swallowed up in victory." That's his argument. Now
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:09.800]   listen to him putting it somewhere else. He puts it like this in writing to the Philippians.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:18.280]   He says, "We are citizens of heaven, from whence also we look for the coming of the
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:25.920]   Lord Jesus, who shall change this our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:33.120]   glorious body, according to that mighty working whereby he is able to subdue even all things
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:38.400]   to himself." Wait for him, look for him. He'll even change your body and glorify
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:48.080]   it. Or listen to him again in Romans 8, 23. He says, "Even we ourselves who have had
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:58.600]   the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves, grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   to it, the redemption of our bodies." Or listen again in 2 Corinthians 5, "If this
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:12.120]   earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God in the heaven, the
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:20.120]   house in heaven's eternal, not made with hens, the house that is made of God." The
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.600]   same argument everywhere. Well now, that's the part of the great argument here in this
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:32.960]   chapter. The resurrection of Christ is a guarantee of my resurrection. As he rose, I shall rise.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.520]   I belong to him. The power that reigns with him will reign with me, and my redemption
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:46.840]   shall be absolutely complete. I shall not be a disembodied spirit in eternity. No, no.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:55.040]   In my flesh I shall see him. My body shall be redeemed. My whole man shall have been
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:03.840]   saved. Spirit, soul, and body, perfect and entire, without any spot or wrinkle or any
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:10.360]   such thing, no longer subject to disease nor to decay, eternally young, everlastingly the
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:18.200]   same, glorying in his eternal presence. You see how important it is to believe in the
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:24.400]   literal physical resurrection? This is an essential part of the Christian faith. And
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.960]   if you rob me of the redemption of my body, you're robbing me of something that is inherently
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:37.280]   a part of this glorious message. Let me say just a word on the last argument, which is
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:47.400]   this. The literal physical resurrection of Christ is a guarantee of the coming of the
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:54.880]   eternal kingdom. Here is how he puts it in verses 24 and 25. "Then cometh the end when
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.440]   he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:06.120]   down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he hath put all enemies
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:13.280]   under his feet." Of course, the people who don't believe in a physical resurrection
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:20.120]   don't believe also in this eternal state, when there shall be a new heaven and a new
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:28.880]   earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. But the Bible teaches it, and it is going to happen.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:35.320]   The Lord Jesus Christ, who was crucified and died and was buried and who rose again and
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:41.600]   who ascended, is seated at this moment at the right hand of God in glory. And what's
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:48.000]   he doing? Well, the apostle tells us, he is waiting until his enemies shall all be put
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:58.440]   under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. But he has already
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:05.720]   conquered him, and he's going to conquer him for us. And there is a day coming when
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:14.000]   every single enemy shall have been destroyed, when Satan and all his followers shall be
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.100]   cast into the lake of destruction, when evil and sin and all that belong to it shall again
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:28.960]   be thrown into the same place of destruction everlastingly, and all that is evil and wrong
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:37.080]   not only in us but in the whole universe shall be purged out. The elements shall melt with
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:47.080]   a fervent heat, and there shall be a regeneration of the whole cosmos. That's coming, he says,
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:53.960]   and coming for certain. Christ has already given proof, he's already conquered Satan,
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   death, the grave, so that we can turn and say, "Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave,
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:10.320]   where is thy victory? You're defeated, he's come out from among you. You've already received
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:22.440]   a mortal wound." And he will usher in this great and glorious kingdom, and still more
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:29.160]   wonderful. And the thing that should move us to the depth of our being and make us sing
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:37.400]   his praise this morning as we've never done before is this, that you and I who belong
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:49.120]   to him shall share that glory with him. We shall be like him. The sting of death is sin,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.080]   and the strength of sin is the law, yes, but he's dealt with the law for me, so that death
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:00.160]   has no terrors for me. As he's conquered it himself, he's conquered it for me. Even death
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:07.080]   cannot hold me, the grave shall not keep me. I shall rise in my body, which shall be glorified,
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:18.400]   and I shall reign with him in this new earth, under the new heaven, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:24.240]   Know ye not, Paul has already said to these Corinthians, "Know ye not that the saints
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:33.000]   shall judge the world? Know ye not that the saints shall judge angels?" That's what he's
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.320]   saying. And it's the physical resurrection that guarantees all this. And when he has
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:45.760]   got rid of sin and evil and the devil and hell, and the kingdom is perfect, he will
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:51.880]   hand it back, he says, to the Father, who has already handed it to him, in order that
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:41:02.160]   he may deliver it in this way. And then God shall be all and in all.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:09.280]   Very well, what do we say to these things? What we say is what the apostle says at the
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:23.240]   end, "Therefore, therefore, therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast." Let the
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:32.320]   philosophers say what they will, let them laugh at this message, let them ridicule it.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:39.840]   Let the world, with its pomp and its show, despise us and think that all this is foolish.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:50.920]   Let them persecute you, let them try you. Let hell be let loose against you. Be steadfast,
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:57.360]   unmovable. Let nothing shake you, let nothing shift you. They'll ask their clever question,
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.080]   "How this? How that?" They were asking it, you see, at the very beginning, nearly two
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:06.520]   thousand years ago. "How can this happen, when a man's body is blown to atoms by a
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:12.440]   bomb? How do you say he'll rise in the body?" I can't tell you, but I'll tell you this,
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:19.800]   that I as an individual and my body with its identity will be in glory. There'll be this
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:27.240]   mysterious change, this process of glorification. The body, you see, isn't flesh and blood.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.480]   Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Draw a distinction between the body
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.320]   and the flesh and the blood. What is my body? Well, it's in a sense the organization of
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.640]   my flesh and blood. That's why my body is mine and yours is yours. My flesh, I'm told
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.840]   by the scientists, is constantly changing. I haven't the same skin as I had ten years
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:54.160]   ago. Flesh and blood is changing, but the body remains. This body of mine will be there,
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:05.200]   so be steadfast and unmovable, but above all, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:15.560]   for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:24.600]   These are not matters of indifference. A truncated gospel is not enough. I demand a complete
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:33.120]   redemption and salvation. And in Christ Jesus, crucified and risen again on the morning of
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:42.120]   the third day, literally in the body, I see a complete, a perfect, a whole, an entire
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:44:07.760]   redemption. Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. Amen.
