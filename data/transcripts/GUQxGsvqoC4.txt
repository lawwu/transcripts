[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.180]   - Well, when should you stop listening to this podcast?
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.000]   Who would ask such a question in the first place?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.720]   I don't know, well, we did.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.080]   It was our very first episode.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.360]   We recorded together on stage in public
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.080]   and we pulled it off at the Getty Sing Conference
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.200]   in Nashville recently.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.240]   About 2,500 friends joined us early in the morning.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.960]   A lot of you who are regular listeners were there.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.760]   So have a listen to our interchange.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.760]   How many of you are regular listeners to the podcast
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.600]   by a show of hands?
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.320]   Wow, thank you.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.600]   It's just amazing to be here with you.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.840]   Typically, this is not our recording setup.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.240]   This is not how we do it in front of a live audience.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.280]   Typically, Professor John is in his home study
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.800]   and I'm in my home study and we connect over Skype.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.520]   We bounce all over topics.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.080]   - And usually I have a computer screen right here
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.040]   in front of me with all the answers.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.480]   (laughing)
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.000]   And I don't have one or a manuscript this time.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.840]   I do have some notes,
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.120]   but I don't know if I'll look at them or not.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.200]   So I don't wing these answers.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960]   Believe me, they take a lot of preparation.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.800]   - They do.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.120]   - They're hard questions, usually.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.040]   - We have over 200 email questions come in to us each week.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.320]   200 email questions.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.400]   And in those emails, I see a lot of recurring questions
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.240]   that come in to us that are very situational.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.920]   So should I marry this lady or this lady?
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.560]   Should I marry this guy or this guy?
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.960]   Should I take this job or this job?
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.580]   We appreciate those situational questions.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.320]   But it raises another question for me,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.680]   and that is, where do you want this podcast
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.400]   to serve our audience when they have spouses,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.300]   they have parents, they have pastors, they have churches,
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.920]   they have other voices in their lives?
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.320]   Where do you want, ask Pastor John, in your wisdom
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.920]   to come into their lives in light of all the other voices
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.660]   God has given them as well?
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.280]   - So how to listen to APJ or how to fit it into your life,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   if it fits in at all, probably should be something
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.680]   that you decide on the basis of what it is.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.940]   So what are we trying to do?
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.080]   Why do you guys do this?
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.280]   You've been doing this for six years, 1,400 episodes.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.880]   Why in the world do you do this?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.080]   So let me give you some roots,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.000]   and then say so in view of those roots
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.280]   and what we're doing, should you listen?
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.880]   And if so, why?
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   And how does it relate to your pastor's preaching and so on?
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.360]   So go back with me to 1966.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.600]   I'm in the hospital with Mono at Wheaton College,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160]   and about 200 yards away is Edmond Chapel,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.480]   and Harold John Ockengay,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.120]   pastor of a big church in Boston,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.840]   was the guest preacher in Spiritual Emphasis Week,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.080]   and he was preaching.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.920]   And WETN is the radio station,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.920]   and I was listening on my bed to his preaching.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.560]   Now I was a pre-med student and excited
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.160]   that God had made plain to me
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.000]   that I was gonna be a medical doctor.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.240]   And lying there and listening to him,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.040]   my world absolutely changed.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.680]   And to sum it up would be,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.720]   I came away from those several days of listening
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.320]   with this passion that has never died.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   It is as close as I've ever had to a call.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   And it was, you're not gonna be a medical doctor.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.920]   You're gonna be a Bible guy,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   and your job for the rest of your life
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.260]   is going to be to look at it,
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.360]   see what's there,
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.280]   try to savor it according to its value,
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.040]   and then say it for other people to enjoy.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.640]   And I have not been able to shake it
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.440]   for what is this, 55 years or whatever, 50 years now
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   that what I do and what we do is look at the Bible,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.760]   try to understand what it says,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.760]   love what it says,
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.200]   and then tell people what it says.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.120]   That's what we do.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.400]   So fast forward to 1980.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.960]   Now I'm the first year of in the pastorate,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.400]   and I get to preach twice on Sunday.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.620]   Back in those days, we had evening services,
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.560]   and I preached twice on Sunday,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.560]   and everything in me said, "That's not enough.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.780]   "I got so much more to say to these,
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.680]   "this is my flock.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.520]   "My job is to tell them what I see in the Bible.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.660]   "I'm seeing things in the Bible every day,
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.720]   "and I can't not want to tell people."
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.400]   I mean, that's just what it means, I think,
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.080]   to be called in this way.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.480]   So we created the star, Bethlehem Star.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   One page, no email, no internet, no nothing in 1980,
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.920]   just snail mail.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.480]   One page, a letter from Pastor John
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.240]   with what I'm seeing in the Bible,
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.880]   and the other side,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.120]   here are all the youth ministers that are happening.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.720]   And so fold it up, mail it to every member.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.500]   That's APJ.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.760]   It's me not able, not to savor,
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.100]   and not to say what I'm seeing in the Bible
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.400]   about all kinds of issues,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.620]   like billboards with half-naked women, okay?
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.640]   So that's what my people are driving by every day.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.400]   I'm writing, I'm gonna say something about that
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.520]   from the Bible.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.580]   I'm a pastor.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.520]   And then you advance forward to,
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.560]   when do we start this, 2013.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.720]   - 13 January, yep.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.720]   - Okay, 2013, I've done star articles for 33 years.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.000]   They're all in books everywhere now.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.040]   But they're stars, and I'm done.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.600]   I leave the pastor.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.960]   I'm not preaching every weekend.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.640]   I'm not counseling anybody.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.960]   I'm just working for DG.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.300]   What should we do?
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.840]   And let's do some pastoral counseling.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.040]   Let's read our Bibles, and let's tell people,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.080]   [laughs]
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.880]   let's tell people what we're seeing in the Bible.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.680]   So that's what we did.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.880]   We started long distance while I was down in Tennessee.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.600]   And so basically, think of me
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.280]   as a guest preacher at your church.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.280]   So I'm invited by your pastor to come.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   I preach a sermon, then he does a little Q&A
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.840]   with me in the afternoon or something like that,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.680]   I don't know.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.760]   And you miss it because you're sick.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.720]   And the pastor says, "Not a problem.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.240]   "We've got our little website.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.360]   "We'll just put it up there, and you can go listen to it."
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.400]   And that's the way you should listen.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.640]   And that changed my life when Harold John Ockengay
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.080]   did a little guest preaching at Wheaton College,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.040]   and my life got turned upside down.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.720]   Now, should you listen?
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.640]   And my answer is this.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.600]   You test all things, hold fast to what is good.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.820]   1 Thessalonians 5:21.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.480]   Here's how you decide whether it's good.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:46.360]   Number one, after I've listened to a handful of APJs,
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.000]   do I love my Bible more than I love APJ?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.440]   Do I go to my Bible with more confidence and more joy
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.440]   because of APJ?
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   Number two, do I love Jesus more than APJ?
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.300]   Do I love Jesus more than I did before I listened?
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.980]   Number three, do I love my church more?
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.220]   Do I love my pastor more?
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.540]   Do I pray for him more earnestly?
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.180]   Do I care for the people in my small group?
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.820]   Do I do my Sunday school class better?
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.180]   Am I better invested locally
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.220]   'cause I listened to this guest preacher?
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.540]   And fourthly, do I love lost people more?
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.140]   Do I love the nations more?
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.340]   Am I praying more earnestly for the mission of the church?
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.740]   If those four things aren't happening, don't listen.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.320]   - Wow, thank you.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.100]   - Is that what you were getting at?
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.940]   - Yeah, that's what I was getting at.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.860]   Here's the lingering question for me.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.660]   Did your wife think she was marrying a medical doctor?
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.740]   - No, no, but she thought she was falling in love
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.060]   with a medical doctor.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.900]   So I did bait and switch,
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.960]   but not intentionally, and she was very, very forgiving
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.500]   because she came to visit, I mean,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   she fell in, we fell in love in 6666.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.620]   It's an easy date to remember, we celebrate it still.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.020]   That's when we met in Fisher Hall,
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.620]   and madly in love, yeah, I'm gonna be a doctor
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.900]   like your dad, and then three months later,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.620]   she can't find me on the first day of class,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.900]   and I'm in the hospital, and then two weeks later,
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.700]   she walks into that room, and I look at her and say,
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.580]   I'm going to seminary, hope that's okay.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.580]   She's been great all the way along.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.980]   Tell you a story, I mean, I don't know how this fits
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.980]   into the recording, but I just gotta celebrate Noel.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.300]   I mean, we were married 50 years last December,
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.880]   and-- (audience applauding)
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:07.820]   I got so depressed my first year in preaching.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.820]   I thought, oh, my, have I done the right thing?
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.420]   You know, I love teaching, and now I've become a pastor,
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.740]   and I'm just depressed out of my mind one Sunday afternoon,
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.140]   and sitting at the dining room table,
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.240]   the bedroom is just off to the right here,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.340]   and she's in the bedroom doing something,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.540]   and I'm sitting at the table, and I say,
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.740]   I think I'm gonna go to Africa.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.980]   And you know what she said from the other room?
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.260]   Tell me when to pack.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.060]   That's an awesome woman.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.140]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.620]   (audience applauding)
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.900]   Amen.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.340]   - So I didn't throw her too much when I said,
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.660]   from doctoring bodies to doctoring souls.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.700]   I love that story, so good.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.880]   And please, please continue to seek the wisdom
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.900]   of those that God has put in your life.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.860]   As Pastor John has said in another context,
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.420]   as you read 1 Thessalonians 5:21,
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.300]   don't miss verses 12 to 14 of that chapter two,
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.100]   which gives a beautiful little sketch
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.120]   of why we need people in our lives, in our local churches,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.500]   and what those relationships should look like.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.820]   Really helpful.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.300]   And thank you to everyone who turned out
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.660]   for this first ever APJ Live recording
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.540]   for Pastor John and me in Nashville.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.620]   Apparently it went well.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.700]   We're gonna do it again in Louisville
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.140]   at the Together for the Gospel Conference
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.340]   in a breakout session on April 15th in Louisville.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.540]   Maybe we'll see some of you there in person.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.040]   Well, Pastor John just finished writing a 600-page book
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.660]   on the providence of God, and so our next question
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.340]   is providentially well-timed.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.140]   Is God's providence and God's sovereignty the same thing,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.740]   or are those different things?
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.460]   It's a really great question.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.980]   It was actually on Pastor John's mind
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.460]   when he was writing the book,
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.820]   and it's up next time on the podcast.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.040]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
