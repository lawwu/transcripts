[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   The following is a conversation with Jeremy Suri,
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.320]   a historian at UT Austin,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.600]   whose research interests and writing
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.000]   are on modern American history
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   with an eye towards presidents
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.200]   and in general individuals who wielded power.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.000]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Element, MonkPak, Belcampo, Four Sigmatic and Eight Sleep.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.680]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.100]   As a side note, let me say that in these conversations,
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.480]   for better or worse, I seek understanding, not activism.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.720]   I'm not left nor right.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.280]   I love ideas, not labels.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.960]   And most fascinating ideas are full of uncertainty,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.720]   tension and trade-offs.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.520]   Labels destroy that.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.420]   I try ideas out, let them breathe for a time,
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.080]   try to challenge, explore and analyze.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.840]   But mostly I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680]   to think and to make up your own mind, together with me.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.200]   I will try to have economists and philosophers on
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.000]   from all points on the multidimensional political spectrum,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.020]   including the extremes.
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.160]   I will try to both have an open mind
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.600]   and to ask difficult questions when needed.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.200]   I'll make mistakes.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.920]   Don't shoot this robot at the first sign of failure.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.600]   I'm still under development.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.400]   Pre-release version 0.1.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.480]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.600]   and here is my conversation with Jeremy Suri.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.000]   You've studied many American presidents throughout history.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.480]   So who do you think was the greatest president
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.920]   in American history?
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.780]   - The greatest American president was Abraham Lincoln.
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.720]   And Tolstoy reflected on this himself, actually,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.120]   saying that when he was in the Caucasus,
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.960]   he asked these peasants in the Caucasus
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.320]   who was the greatest man in the world
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.400]   that they had heard of.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.200]   And they said, Abraham Lincoln.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.680]   And why?
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.600]   Well, because he gave voice
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.880]   to people who had no voice before.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.680]   He turned politics into an art.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.180]   This is what Tolstoy recounted,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.740]   the peasants in the Caucasus telling him.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.320]   Lincoln made politics more than about power.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.440]   He made it an art.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.760]   He made it a source of liberation.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.240]   And those living even far from the United States
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.880]   could see that model, that inspiration from Lincoln.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.680]   He was a man who had two years of education,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.680]   yet he mastered the English language
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.280]   and he used the language to help people
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.760]   imagine a different kind of world.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.500]   You see, leaders and presidents are at their best
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.440]   when they're doing more
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.000]   than just manipulating institutions and power,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.520]   when they're helping the people imagine a better world.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.400]   And he did that as no other president has.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.980]   - And you say he gave voice to those who are voiceless.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.400]   Who are you talking to about in general?
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.680]   Is this about African-Americans
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.880]   or is this about just the populace in general?
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.640]   - Certainly part of it is about slaves, African-Americans,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.360]   and many immigrants, immigrants from all parts of Europe
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.760]   and other areas that have come to the United States.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240]   But part of it was just for ordinary American citizens.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.520]   The Republican Party,
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.540]   for which Lincoln was the first president,
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.040]   was a party created to give voice to poor white men,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.620]   as well as slaves and others.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.940]   And Lincoln was a poor white man himself.
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.840]   Grew up without slaves and without land,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.140]   which meant you had almost nothing.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.020]   - What do you think about the trajectory of that man
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.960]   with only two years of education?
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.060]   Is there something to be said
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.660]   about how does one come from nothing
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.660]   and nurture the ideals that kind of make this country great
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.820]   into something where you can actually be a leader
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.080]   of this nation to espouse those ideas,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.620]   to give the voice to the voiceless?
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.340]   - Yes, I think you actually hit the nail on the head.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.620]   I think what he represented was the opportunity,
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.140]   and that was the word that mattered for him,
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.080]   opportunity that came from the ability to raise yourself up,
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.380]   to work hard and to be compensated for your hard work.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.340]   And this is at the core of the Republican Party
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.900]   of the 19th century, which is the core of capitalism.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.200]   It's not about getting rich.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.380]   It's about getting compensated for your work.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.780]   It's about being incentivized to do better work.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.460]   And Lincoln was constantly striving.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.620]   One of his closest associates, Herndon,
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.980]   said he was the little engine of ambition that couldn't stop.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.060]   He just kept going, taught himself to read,
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.220]   taught himself to be a lawyer.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.620]   He went through many failed businesses
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.180]   before he even reached that point,
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.540]   many failed love affairs, but he kept trying.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.420]   He kept working, and what American society offered him
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.020]   and what he wanted American society to offer everyone else
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.740]   was the opportunity to keep trying to fail
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.680]   and then get up and try again.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.660]   - What do you think was the nature of that ambition?
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.220]   Was there a hunger for power?
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.740]   - I think Lincoln had a hunger for success.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.300]   I think he had a hunger to get out
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.380]   of the poor station he was in.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.060]   He had a hunger to be someone
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.020]   who had control over his life.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.620]   Freedom for him did not mean the right
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.500]   to do anything you wanna do,
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.460]   but it meant the right to be secure
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.120]   from being dependent upon someone else.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.660]   So independence.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.860]   He writes in his letters when he's very young
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.680]   that he hated being dependent on his father.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.460]   He grew up without a mother.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.260]   His father was a struggling farmer,
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.660]   and he would write in his letters
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.220]   that his father treated him like a slave on the farm.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.620]   Some think his hatred of slavery came from that experience.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.220]   He didn't ever wanna have to work for someone again.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.860]   He wanted to be free and independent,
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.240]   and he wanted, again, every American,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.480]   this is the kind of Jeffersonian dream,
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.020]   to be the owner of themself and the owner of their future.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.100]   - Yeah, that's a really nice definition of freedom.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.140]   We often think kind of this very abstract notion
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.460]   of being able to do anything you want,
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.900]   but really it's ultimately breaking yourself free
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.900]   from the constraints, like the very tight dependence
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.900]   on whether it's the institutions or on your family
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.500]   or the expectations or the community or whatever,
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.340]   being able to be, to realize yourself
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.740]   within the constraints of your own abilities.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.700]   It's still not true freedom.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.100]   It's true freedom is probably sort of
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.860]   almost like designing a video game character
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.020]   or something like that.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.860]   - I agree.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.940]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.940]   I think freedom is not that I can have any outcome I want.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.300]   I can't control outcomes.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.900]   The most powerful, freest person in the world
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.460]   cannot control outcomes,
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.300]   but it means that at least I get to make choices.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.660]   Someone else doesn't make those choices for me.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.780]   - Is there something to be said about Lincoln
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.780]   and on the political game front of it,
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.460]   which is he's accomplished some of them?
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.380]   I don't know, but it seems like
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.680]   there was some tricky politics going on.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.480]   We tend to not think of it in those terms
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.600]   because of the dark aspects of slavery.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.780]   We tend to think about it in sort of ethical and human terms,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.780]   but in their time, it was probably as much a game of politics
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.780]   not just these broad questions of human nature, right?
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.300]   It was a game.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.580]   So is there something to be said about being a skillful
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.340]   player in the game of politics that you'd take from Lincoln?
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.300]   - Absolutely, and Lincoln never read Karl von Clausewitz,
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.860]   the great 19th century German thinker on strategy
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.220]   and politics, but he embodied the same wisdom,
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.820]   which is that everything is politics.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.540]   If you wanna get anything done,
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.940]   and this includes even relationships,
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.860]   there's a politics to it.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.680]   What does that mean?
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.260]   It means that you have to persuade, coerce,
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.300]   encourage people to do things they wouldn't otherwise do.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.620]   And Lincoln was a master at that.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.060]   He was a master at that for two reasons.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.700]   He had learned through his hard life to read people,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.260]   to anticipate them, to spend a lot of time listening.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.220]   One thing I often tell people is the best leaders
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.540]   are the listeners, not the talkers.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.580]   And then second, Lincoln was very thoughtful
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.460]   and planned every move out.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.180]   He was thinking three or four moves,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.500]   maybe five moves down the chessboard,
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.140]   while others were move number one or two.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.300]   - That's fascinating to think about him
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.460]   just listening, just studying.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.740]   They look at great fighters in this way,
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.320]   like the first few rounds of boxing and mixed martial arts,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.620]   you're studying the movement of your opponent
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.580]   in order to sort of define the holes.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.620]   That's a really interesting frame to think about it.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.640]   Is there, in terms of relationships,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.460]   where do you think as president or as a politician
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.060]   is the most impact to be had?
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.140]   I've been reading a lot about Hitler recently.
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.140]   And one of the things that I'm more and more
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.020]   starting to wonder, what the hell did he do alone
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.560]   in a room one-on-one with people?
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.820]   Because it seems like that's where
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.860]   he was exceptionally effective.
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.080]   When I think about certain leaders,
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.220]   I'm not sure Stalin was this way, I apologize.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.060]   Been very obsessed with this period of human history.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.500]   It just seems like certain leaders
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.980]   are extremely effective one-on-one.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.980]   A lot of people think of Hitler in Lincoln
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.660]   as a speech maker, as a great charismatic speech maker.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.620]   But it seems like to me that some of these guys
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.620]   were really effective inside a room.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.380]   And what do you think, what's more important?
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.380]   Your effectiveness to make a hell of a good speech?
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.660]   Sort of being in a room with many people?
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.280]   Or is it all boiled down to one-on-one?
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.180]   - Well, I think in a sense, it's both.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.300]   One needs to do both.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.700]   And most politicians, most leaders are better
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.620]   at one or the other.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.940]   It's the rare leader who can do both.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.740]   I will say that if you are going to be a figure
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.620]   who's a president or the leader of a complex organization,
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.520]   not a startup, but a complex organization
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.500]   where you have many different constituencies
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.580]   and many different interests,
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.580]   you have to do the one-on-one really well.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.540]   Because a lot of what's going to happen
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.920]   is you're going to be meeting with people
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.720]   who represent different groups, right?
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.420]   The leader of the labor unions,
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.340]   the leader of your investing board, et cetera.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.140]   And you have to be able to persuade them.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.820]   And it's the intangibles that often matter most.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.220]   Lincoln's skill, and it's the same that FDR had,
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.220]   is the ability to tell a story.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.820]   I think Hitler was a little different,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.100]   but what I've read of Stalin is he was a storyteller too.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.100]   - One-on-one storyteller?
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.980]   - Yeah, that's my understanding is that he,
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.140]   and what Lincoln did,
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.540]   I don't want to compare Lincoln to Stalin,
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.380]   but Lincoln did is he was not confrontational.
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.300]   He was happy to have an argument
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.540]   if an argument were to be had,
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.700]   but actually what he would try to do
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.780]   is move you through telling a story
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.580]   that got you to think about your position
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.220]   in a different way, to basically disarm you.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.820]   And Franklin Roosevelt did the same thing.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.240]   Ronald Reagan did the same thing.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.500]   Storytelling is a very important skill.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.420]   - It's almost heartbreaking that we don't get to have,
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.700]   or maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong on this,
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.220]   but it feels like we don't have a lot of information
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.780]   on how all of these folks were in private,
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.940]   one-on-one conversations.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.820]   Even if we get stories about it,
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.960]   it's like, again, sorry to bring up Hitler,
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   but people have talked about his piercing gaze
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.740]   when they're one-on-one.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.520]   There's a feeling like he's just looking through you.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.140]   I wonder, it makes me wonder,
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.140]   was Lincoln somebody who was a little bit more passive,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.820]   the ego doesn't shine.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.260]   It's not an overwhelming thing,
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.380]   or is it more like, again,
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.100]   don't wanna bring up controversial figures,
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.700]   but Donald Trump, where it's more menacing, right?
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.780]   There's a more physically menacing thing
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.060]   where it's almost like a bullying kind of dynamic.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.180]   So I wonder, I wish we knew.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.580]   'Cause from a psychological perspective,
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.060]   I wonder if there's a thread
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.660]   that connects most great leaders.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.180]   - It's a great question.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.180]   So I think the best writer on this is Max Weber, right?
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.620]   And he talks about the power of charisma,
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.900]   that the term charisma comes from Weber, right?
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.020]   And Weber's use of it actually to talk about prophets.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.940]   And I think he has a point, right?
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.820]   Leaders who are effective in the way you describe
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.860]   are leaders who feel prophetic,
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.940]   or Weber says they have a kind of magic about them.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.960]   And I think that can come from different sources.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.700]   I think that can come from the way someone
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.580]   carries themselves.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.080]   It can come from the way they use words.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.540]   So maybe there are different kinds of magic
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.000]   that someone develops.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.260]   But I think there are two things
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.460]   that seem to be absolutely necessary.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.780]   First is you have to be someone who sizes up the person
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.100]   on the other side of the table.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.800]   You cannot be the person who just comes in
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.780]   and reads your brief.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.300]   And then second, I think it's interactive.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.300]   And there is a quickness of thought.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.860]   So you brought up Donald Trump.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.860]   I don't think Donald Trump is a deep thinker at all,
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.700]   but he's quick.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.820]   And I think that quickness is part of it.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   It's different from delivering a lecture
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.100]   where it's the depth of your thought.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.780]   Can you, for 45 minutes, analyze something?
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.340]   Many people can't do that,
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.300]   but they still might be very effective
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.500]   if they're able to quickly react,
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.760]   size up the person on the other side of the table,
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.860]   and react in a way that moves that person
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.940]   in the way they wanna move them.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.740]   - Yeah, and there's also just a couple to the quickness
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.980]   is a kind of instinct about human nature.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.820]   - Yes.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.020]   - Sort of asking the question,
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.300]   what does this person worry about?
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.060]   What are the biggest problems?
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.220]   Somebody, what is it, Stephen Schwarzman, I think,
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.780]   said to me, this businessman,
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.060]   I think he said, "What I've always tried to do
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.920]   "is try to figure out, ask enough questions
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.840]   "to figure out what is the biggest problem
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.940]   "in this person's life."
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.820]   Try to get a sense of what is the biggest problem
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.640]   in their life,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.820]   because that's actually what they care about most.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.620]   And most people don't care enough to find out.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.220]   And so he kind of wants to sneak up on that
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.220]   and find that, and then use that to then build closeness
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.700]   in order to then, probably, he doesn't put it in those words
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.060]   but to manipulate the person into whatever,
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.500]   to do whatever the heck they want.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.140]   And I think part of it is that,
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.660]   and part of the effect that Donald Trump has
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.300]   is how quick he's able to figure that out.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.460]   You've written a book about how the role
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.900]   and power of the presidency has changed.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.660]   So how has it changed since Lincoln's time,
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.580]   the evolution of the presidency as a concept,
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.620]   which seems like a fascinating lens
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.340]   through which to look at American history.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.780]   As a president, we seem to only be talking
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.060]   about the presidents, maybe a general here and there,
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.540]   but it's mostly the story of America
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.220]   is often told through presidents.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.740]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.580]   And one of the points I've tried to make
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.260]   in my writing about this and various other activities
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.100]   is we use this word president
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.660]   as if it's something timeless.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.500]   But the office has changed incredibly.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   Just from Lincoln's time to the present,
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.260]   which is 150 years, he wouldn't recognize the office today.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.420]   And George Washington would not have recognized it
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.820]   in Lincoln, just as I think a CEO today
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.800]   would be unrecognizable to a Rockefeller
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.700]   or a Carnegie of 150 years ago.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.940]   So what are some of the ways in which the office has changed?
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.340]   I'll just point to three, there are a lot.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.940]   One, presidents now can communicate
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.620]   with the public directly.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.620]   I mean, we've reached the point now
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.060]   where a president can have direct,
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.060]   almost one-on-one communication.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.300]   President can use Twitter, if he so chooses,
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.360]   to circumvent all media.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.220]   That was unthinkable.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.400]   Lincoln, in order to get his message across,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.860]   often wrote letters to newspapers
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.660]   and waited for the newspaper, for Horace Greeley
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.820]   in the New York Tribune to publish his letter.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.220]   That's how he communicated with the public.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.220]   There weren't even many speaking opportunities.
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.820]   So that's a big change, right?
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.220]   We feel the president in our life much more.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.240]   That's why we talk about him much more.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.300]   That also creates more of a burden.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.180]   This is the second point.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.460]   Presidents are under a microscope.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.740]   Presidents are under a microscope.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.900]   You have to be very careful what you do and what you say,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.580]   and you're judged by a lot of the elements of your behavior
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.860]   that are not policy relevant.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.300]   In fact, the things we judge most
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.940]   and make most of our decisions on about individuals
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.020]   are often that.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.620]   And then third, the power the president has.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.180]   It's inhuman, actually.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.500]   And this is one of my critiques
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.540]   of how the office has changed.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.260]   This one person has power on a scale
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.280]   that's, I think, dangerous in a democracy,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.940]   and certainly something the founders 220 years ago
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.420]   would have had trouble conceiving.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.580]   Presidents now have the ability to deliver force
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.540]   across the world to literally assassinate people
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.620]   with a remarkable accuracy.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.620]   And that's an enormous power that presidents have.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.220]   - So your sense, this is not to get conspiratorial,
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:53.220]   but do you think a president currently has the power
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:58.620]   to initiate the assassination of somebody,
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.540]   of a political enemy, or a terrorist leader,
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.060]   or that kind of thing, to frame that person
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.620]   in a way where assassination is something that he alone
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.360]   or she alone could decide to do?
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.500]   - I think it happens all the time,
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.660]   and it's not to be conspiratorial.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.960]   This is how we've fought terrorism,
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.360]   by targeting individuals.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.660]   Now, you might say these were not elected leaders of state,
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.380]   but these were individuals with a large following.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.660]   I mean, the killing of Osama bin Laden
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.500]   was an assassination operation.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.980]   And we've taken out very successfully
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.980]   many leaders of terrorist organizations,
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.620]   and we do it every day.
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.620]   - You're saying that back in Lincoln's time
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.100]   or George Washington's time,
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.780]   there was more of a balance of power?
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.520]   Like a president could not initiate
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.860]   this kind of assassination?
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.120]   - Correct, I think presidents did not have
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.280]   the same kind of military or economic power.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.460]   We could talk about how a president
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.060]   can influence a market, right,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.700]   by saying something about where money is gonna go,
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.820]   or singling out a company,
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.220]   or critiquing a company in one way or another.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.380]   They didn't have that kind of power.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.020]   Now, much of the power that a Lincoln or a Washington had
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.220]   was the power to mobilize people
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.700]   to then make their own decisions.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.540]   At the start of the Civil War,
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.720]   Lincoln doesn't even have the power
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.900]   to bring people into the army.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.620]   He has to go to the governors
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.260]   and ask the governors to provide soldiers.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.660]   So the governor of Wisconsin,
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.780]   the governor of Massachusetts.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.260]   Could you imagine that today?
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.780]   (Lex laughing)
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.620]   - So, but yeah, so they used speeches and words
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.480]   to mobilize versus direct action
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.500]   in closed-door environments,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.640]   initiating wars, for example.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.480]   - Correct.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.140]   - It's difficult to think about,
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.280]   if we look at Barack Obama, for example,
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.720]   if you're listening to this,
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.940]   and you're on the left or the right,
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.220]   please do not make this political.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.520]   In fact, if you're a political person,
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.300]   and you're getting angry at the mention
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.140]   of the word Obama or Donald Trump,
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.940]   please turn off this podcast and unsubscribe.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.580]   We're not gonna get very far.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.180]   I hope we maintain a political discussion
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.060]   about even the modern presidents
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.460]   that viewed through the lens of history.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.300]   I think there's a lot to be learned
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.200]   about the office and about human nature.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.060]   Some people criticize Barack Obama
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.520]   for sort of expanding the military industrial complex,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.220]   engaging in more and more wars,
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.620]   as opposed to sort of the initial rhetoric
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.660]   was such that we would pull back
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.700]   from sort of be more skeptical
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.140]   in our decisions to wage wars.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.900]   So from the lens of the power of the presidency,
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.540]   as the modern presidency,
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.940]   the fact that we continue the war in Afghanistan
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.640]   at different engagements in military conflicts,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:51.740]   do you think Barack Obama could have stopped that?
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.700]   Do you put the responsibility on that expansion on him
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.700]   because of the implied power that the presidency has?
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.020]   Or is this power just sits there,
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.580]   and if the president chooses to take it, they do,
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.860]   and if they don't, they don't,
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.100]   almost like you don't want to take on the responsibility
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.980]   because of the burden of that responsibility?
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.380]   - So a lot of my research is about this exact question,
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.680]   not just with Obama.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.020]   And my conclusion,
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.640]   and I think the research is pretty clear on this,
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.580]   is that structure has a lot more effect on us
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.940]   than we like to admit,
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.780]   which is to say that the circumstances,
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.220]   the institutions around us,
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.600]   drive our behavior more than we like to think.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.620]   So Barack Obama, I'm quite certain,
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.020]   came into the office of the presidency
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.260]   committed to actually reducing
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.880]   the use of military force overseas
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.780]   and reducing presidential war-making power.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.940]   As a trained lawyer,
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.380]   he had a moral position on this actually,
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.700]   and he tried, and he did withdraw American forces from Iraq
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.660]   and was of course criticized by many people for doing that.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.540]   But at the same time,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.820]   he had some real problems in the world to deal with,
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.540]   terrorism being one of them.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.060]   And the tools he has are very much biased
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.020]   towards the use of military force.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.380]   It's much harder as president
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.920]   to go and get Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.360]   to agree with you.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.760]   It's much easier to send these wonderful toys we have
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.760]   and these incredible soldiers we have over there.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.800]   And when you have Congress, which is always against you,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.640]   it's also easier to use the military
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.900]   because you send them there.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.280]   And even if members of Congress
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.980]   from your own party or the other are angry at you,
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.200]   they'll still fund the soldiers.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.860]   No member of Congress wants to vote
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.940]   to starve our soldiers overseas.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.960]   So they'll stop your budget,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.200]   they'll even threaten not to pay the debt,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.000]   but they'll still fund your soldiers.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.920]   And so you are pushed by the circumstances you're in
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.840]   to do this, and it's very hard to resist.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.320]   So that's, I think the criticism of Obama,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.040]   the fair one would be that he didn't resist the pressures
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.760]   that were there, but he did not make those pressures.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.400]   - So is there something about
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.640]   putting the responsibility on the president
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.000]   to form the structure around him locally
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.640]   such that he can make the policy
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.540]   that matches the rhetoric?
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.760]   So what I'm talking to is hiring.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.800]   So basically just everybody you work with,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.120]   you have power as a president to fire and hire
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.760]   or to basically schedule meetings
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.920]   in such a way that can control your decision-making.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.720]   So I imagine it's very difficult
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.360]   to get out of Afghanistan or Iraq
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.200]   when most of your scheduled meetings are with generals
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   or something like that.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.680]   But if you reorganize the schedule
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.720]   and you reorganize who you have late night talks with,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.840]   you potentially have a huge ripple effect on the policy.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.680]   - I think that's right.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.560]   I think who has access to the president
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.840]   is absolutely crucial.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.060]   And presidents have to be more strategic about that.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.440]   They tend to be reacting to crises
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.160]   'cause every day is a crisis.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.220]   And if you're reacting to a crisis,
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.320]   you're not controlling access
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.260]   because the crisis is driving you.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.600]   So that's one element of it.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.440]   But I also think,
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.160]   and this is the moment we're in right now,
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.120]   presidents have to invest in reforming the system,
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.780]   the system of decision-making.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.740]   Should we have a National Security Council
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.280]   that looks the way it does?
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.600]   Should our military be structured the way it is?
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.640]   The founding fathers wanted a military that was divided.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.000]   They did not want a unified Department of Defense.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.160]   That was only created after World War II.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.800]   Should we have as large a military as we have?
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.060]   Should we be in as many places?
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.320]   There are some fundamental structural reforms
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.720]   we have to undertake.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.180]   And part of that is who you appoint,
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.640]   but part of that is also how you change the institutions.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.320]   The genius of the American system
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.220]   is that it's a dynamic system.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.480]   It can be adjusted.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.200]   It has been adjusted over time.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.600]   That's the heroic story.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.600]   The frustrating story is it often takes us a long time
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.680]   to make those adjustments
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.040]   until we go into such bad circumstances
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.800]   that we have no choice.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.760]   - So in the battle of power
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.460]   of the office of the president
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.540]   versus the United States military,
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.700]   the Department of Defense,
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.980]   do you have a sense that the president
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.940]   has more power ultimately?
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.060]   So to decrease the size of the Department of Defense,
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.620]   to withdraw from any wars,
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.180]   or increase the amount of wars,
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.540]   is the president,
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.480]   you're kind of implying the president
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.700]   has a lot of power here in this scale.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.280]   - Yes, the president has a lot of power,
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.300]   and we are fortunate,
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.580]   and it was just proven in the last few years
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.560]   that our military,
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.140]   uniquely among many countries with large militaries,
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.920]   is very deferential to the president
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.540]   and very restricted in its ability
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.380]   to challenge the president.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.820]   So that's a strength of our system.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.940]   But the way you reform the military
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.660]   is not with individual decisions.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.380]   It's by having a strategic plan
