[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   We opened 2019 working through some important questions about Bible reading, all emailed
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.360]   in to us from you, the listeners. Thank you for your continued engagement with the podcast.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.080]   Today's question comes from a listener in Germany named Michael. "Dear Pastor John,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.440]   when does a lack of Bible reading become a sin? I fear this trend in my own friends and
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.580]   our Western society. We have easy access to the Bible, but I feel like many Christians
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.040]   spend little or even almost no time in the Word. A 'Christian' that reads a lot and
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.880]   doesn't act upon it is not better either. Nevertheless, when would you start correcting
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.720]   a fellow believer for not spending enough time in the Word?"
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.100]   Let's take Michael's first question as the main one. When does a lack of Bible reading
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:00.120]   become a sin? And my hope is that in giving a kind of triage of diminishing Bible reading,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.880]   Michael might be able to discern when to step into his friend's life and exhort him. So
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:17.780]   here are my five symptoms of sinful diminishing of Bible reading. When does diminishing Bible
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.260]   reading become a sin? How might we discern when our slacking off in Bible reading and
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.660]   meditation is becoming sinful? Number one, diminishing Bible reading and meditation is
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:39.320]   becoming sinful where it is owing to a loss of desperation for what the Bible alone can
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:48.580]   give. God's Word is designed like nothing else to give us glimpses of God Himself. 1
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:56.540]   Samuel 3.21, "The Lord appeared again at Shiloh, for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:05.500]   at Shiloh by the Word of the Lord." The Bible gives faith. Faith comes by hearing and hearing
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.900]   by the Word. John 10.17. "We believe through the Apostles' Word." John 17.20. The Bible
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.900]   gives joy. "These things I speak in the world, that you may have my joy fulfilled in yourself."
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.260]   John 17.13. The Bible gives holiness. "Sanctify them in the truth. Your Word is truth." John
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.340]   17.17. Wherever diminishing Bible reading is owing to a loss of desperation for seeing
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.040]   God, trusting God, rejoicing in God, and holiness, as though these things don't matter or can
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.860]   be found without the Word, sin is taking hold. Number two, diminishing Bible reading and
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:56.260]   meditation is becoming sinful where it is owing to disillusionment with the Bible because
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.860]   it has not been pursued by faith, but rather as a performance to win God's favor. Paul
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.380]   says, "Whatever is not from faith is sin." And that includes—he said that in Romans
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.940]   14.23—that includes Bible reading that is not from faith. Reading by faith means reading
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:29.860]   with a reliance on the great reality in Christ that God is 100% for us and that He will incline
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.520]   our hearts to His Word. Psalm 119.36. He'll open our eyes. Psalm 119.18. He'll satisfy
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.860]   our souls. Psalm 90.14. If we don't read by faith, we will be disillusioned. And if
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:53.100]   diminishing Bible reading is owing to that disillusionment, it is sin. Number three,
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.300]   diminishing Bible reading and meditation is becoming sinful where the activities that
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:07.540]   replace it are not experienced as the fruit of it. In other words, it's right to stop
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:15.420]   reading your Bible in the morning and go to work if your work is experienced as a fruit
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.780]   of what you saw of God and savored of God in the Word. God did not design the Bible
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.740]   to be read 18 hours a day so that we do nothing else. He designed the Bible as a tree that
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.460]   produces delicious fruit of living for the glory of God and the good of others. So the
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:47.980]   test is this. When we stop reading the Bible, is it because we are gladly experiencing its
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:56.660]   replacement as the fruit of it? If not, then probably our lives are not the fruit of God's
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:05.100]   Word but an alien tree, and our diminishing Bible reading is becoming sinful. Number four,
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.420]   diminishing Bible reading and meditation is becoming sinful where we are drifting away
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.500]   from it because we have ceased to find in it something more precious than gold and sweeter
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.340]   than honey. That's Psalm 19.10. "More to be desired are these words than gold, even much
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.100]   fine gold, sweeter than honey, and drippings from the honeycomb." This preciousness and
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:39.460]   this sweetness are meant to entice us back freely and joyfully to the Word so that we
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:48.540]   gladly say, "Oh, how I love your law. It is my meditation all the day," Psalm 119.97.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:56.400]   If our Bible reading is diminishing because we no longer embrace this preciousness or
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:05.820]   taste this sweetness, the diminishing is sin. Finally, number five, diminishing Bible reading
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:15.700]   and meditation is becoming sinful where it is owing to an immature, adolescent-like recoiling
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.900]   from the traditions we saw in our parents or in our church that seemed hypocritical
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:33.500]   and barren. It's a mark of great immaturity in 20-somethings and 30-somethings and 40-somethings
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:42.300]   to refuse to do something well because your parents did it poorly, like refusing to be
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:50.200]   a doctor because your dad was a quack or refusing to enjoy dessert because your mom was overweight
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.600]   or refusing to listen to classical music because that's all they let you listen to when you're
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.360]   a teenager. That's idiotic. That's immature. Don't be like that. Or refusing to read your
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.400]   Bible daily because your dad did it and he beat your mom. He was abusive and he read
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:18.680]   his Bible. That kind of immaturity is a tactical triumph of Satan, and you don't want to be
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:27.260]   Satan's lackey and act like an immature, adolescent follower of the evil one. Perhaps the concluding
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:35.320]   word should be to all of us, if we begin to drift from reading and meditating on God's
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:44.240]   Word, we should say with Peter, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.640]   life," John 6, 68. Amen. That's a great text to end with, Pastor
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.520]   John. Thank you. And we've now surpassed 1,300 total episodes, thanks to your interest
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.120]   and questions over the past six years and for your support as well. Thank you for sending
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.200]   this one in, Michael. You can search all of our episodes. You can read transcripts, even
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:11.760]   send us a question that you might have of your own, all at our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.000]   Until Friday, we transition from Bible reading to marriage and hear from a woman who feels
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.560]   like she's drifting from her husband, and she wants 2019 to be different for their relationship.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.640]   So what will it take? It's an important question. It's up next. I'm Tony Reinke, your host.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.920]   We'll see you again on Friday.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.420]   [END]
