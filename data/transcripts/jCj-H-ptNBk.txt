[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Now I'd like to call your attention this morning to the eighth verse in that portion of Scripture
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.040]   that was read to us, the first epistle of Peter, the first chapter and verse eight.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.680]   "Whom having not seen ye love, in whom though now ye see him not yet believing,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.200]   ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory."
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.520]   Now I call attention to this because here in this verse we have one of the many definitions
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.720]   of the Christian that are to be found scattered about in the New Testament, in the writings
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.880]   of all the various apostles. And there is nothing it seems to me at the present time that is more
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.680]   important than that we should all be perfectly clear in our minds as to what it really means
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.840]   to be a Christian. We are living in days, unfortunately, which are characterized above
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.760]   everything else by confusion. Never perhaps has there been such confusion in the Christian church
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.960]   as there is at the present time. You are but to listen to what can be heard on the radio,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.600]   the television, or you are but to read the religious journals and papers to see that there
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:35.360]   is an obvious, evident confusion in the minds of people as to what indeed constitutes a Christian.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.880]   And therefore I make no apology at all for calling your attention to this great basic definition
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.240]   that we have in this verse that we're going to look at together.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.280]   Now I want to remind you that these words were written to just ordinary Christians.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.960]   I mean by that that they were not written to a group of apostles or of church leaders.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.560]   The apostle tells us that he doesn't even know the names of these people at all. They are strangers
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.920]   which are scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. He doesn't know
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   their names. He's never seen them. They're unknown members of the Christian church,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:35.440]   and yet you notice that this is what he assumes to be true of them. He's not giving us a definition
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.280]   therefore of some great outstanding notable exceptional Christians. This is what was
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:52.720]   obviously regarded as the norm, the standard, the pattern of any Christian in the first age
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.880]   and century of the Christian church. And therefore it is very important that we should
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.400]   bear that in mind because here obviously is something by which we all can test ourselves,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.080]   something by which we all must test ourselves. My feeling increasingly is that the fact that so
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.920]   many people are outside the Christian church today in all the nations is very largely due
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.080]   to the fact that we were inside have somehow or another failed to attract them, failed to
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.000]   demonstrate to them what the Christian life really is. Were we to do so, I believe we would attract
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.880]   them as a magnet, and they would be anxious and concerned to share the life and the privileged
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.520]   position that we enjoy. In other words, I hold the view very strongly that the best and the quickest
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   method of evangelism is always a revived church, a church consisting of men and women who are
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.680]   truly Christian, who know what it is to be a Christian, and who therefore inevitably will draw
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.600]   and attract others. So that I feel nothing is more important for us at this time than that we
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.720]   should all examine and search ourselves and make quite sure that we conform to this New Testament
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.480]   pattern and standard. And here it is in one of its most notable forms. Now there are so many who
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.520]   have their vague ideas as to what makes a man a Christian. Some think that because a man's born
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.360]   in a certain country that he's a Christian. Others think that because his parents were Christian that
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.720]   he's a Christian. Some think that if he's christened as a baby he's a Christian. Some
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.880]   think that if he does good he's a Christian and makes sacrifices or holds certain idealistic views.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:56.800]   This is the sort of thing, as I say, that you hear so frequently and that you find so commonly in the
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.960]   books and the journals and the papers. This is the common idea today of the Christian. But I
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:12.080]   want to try to show you that all that is quite wrong falls entirely short of what we have here.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.800]   Now let's look at it in some kind of concrete manner. There are those, as I say, who seem to
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.600]   think that if a man holds certain views with respect to war and bombs and things like that,
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.160]   that that inevitably makes him a Christian. Or that if a man is moral that he's a Christian.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.440]   I want to show you that you can hold such views and live a very good life and still not be a
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.640]   Christian at all. They'd got a high moral standard under the Old Testament dispensation, but they
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   were not Christians. And there are many men today who deny the very centralities of the Christian
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.400]   faith, who nevertheless have very noble views and are doing very noble and excellent work in
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.520]   various parts of the world. But these are not the things that make a man a Christian. Well, what
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:10.000]   then? Well, here says Peter, the fundamental thing, the basic thing is our relationship to
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.080]   the Lord Jesus Christ, whom having not seen ye love, in whom, though now ye see him not yet
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.920]   believing, ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory. He's referring to the one to whom
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.880]   he's been speaking, that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.200]   perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glorying at the
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:50.160]   appearing of Jesus Christ, whom. Now here is the central and the vital matter. Christianity is
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:07:00.240]   Christ. And there is no such thing as being Christian except in terms of our relationship to
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:07.840]   this blessed person. Without him, there is no Christianity at all. A man, I say, may be a
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:15.600]   believer in God, but if he is not in this peculiar relationship to Jesus Christ, he is not a
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.920]   Christian. The Jews believe in God. The Mohammedans believe in God. There are many others who
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.640]   believe in God. They are theists. But that doesn't make a man a Christian. There is this
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:36.560]   differentiating, this peculiar thing, this thing that marks us off from all others, and it is our
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.400]   relationship to this blessed person. Where does he come in our lives? Where does he come in all
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.800]   our thinking, all our meditating, all our hopes, everything that is true of us? The Christian is a
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:58.720]   man whose whole life and outlook are centered upon this blessed person. And here the Apostle
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:07.440]   tells us that this relationship of ours to the Lord Jesus Christ takes at any rate three main,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:15.520]   basic, primary forms. And I want to call your attention to them. The first thing that he
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.840]   tells us about the relationship of the Christian to the Lord Jesus Christ is that he believes in
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:35.920]   him, though now we see him not yet believing. He believes in and on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:42.800]   Now what does that mean? Here is a term again that we often tend to use glibly, lightly,
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:51.040]   and loosely, without realizing fully what we mean, without realizing its great and tremendous content.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:09:00.640]   What do we mean by saying that we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? Well, it means something like
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:09.840]   this, doesn't it? Here is a man who for some reason or another has become awakened about the state
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.240]   and the condition of his soul. He may have gone on living for years in a very satisfied manner.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:23.040]   He's done well. Everything seems to be working harmoniously for his good and for his benefit.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.120]   But at last, for various reasons, doesn't matter what exactly the reason is,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.800]   the man becomes aware of the fact that he's got a soul, that he's not just an animal, that this
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.120]   is not the only life, the only world. He realizes that there is that within him which is imperishable.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.040]   He comes to a realization that he's been ignoring this and neglecting this.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:57.120]   Furthermore, he realizes that he is related to God, that he's a creature created in the image of
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.520]   God. But he hasn't come into this world accidentally. He becomes conscious of the fact that he's a
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:11.760]   responsible being, a responsible moral being. He's been given this great gift of life and of the soul,
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:19.120]   not that he may do as he wishes or as he chooses with it, but in order that he may please God.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:29.200]   He remembers the teaching of the Shorter Catechism, drawn up by the great Westminster
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.120]   Conference in London 300 years ago, that catechism that goes with the confession.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.600]   The first question is, "What is the chief end of men?" And the answer is, "The chief end of men
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:50.480]   is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever." But this man suddenly awakens to the realization
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.640]   that he's never been concerned about that at all. He's lived for himself, his own enjoyment,
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.240]   and his immediate family and friends perhaps. He's never thought of himself and of his life
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:10.400]   in terms of God and his relationship to God and his responsibility to God. It's never dawned upon
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:17.200]   him that when he comes to die he will have to stand before God in the judgment and give an account
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.800]   of himself and his life and all that he's done in this world. But suddenly all this comes to him,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:31.280]   and he becomes concerned about it, and he decides that he's going to live a different life,
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.400]   a new life and a better life. He decides that he will attend a place of worship.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.760]   He decides to start reading his Bible. He tries to pray. He stops doing certain things. He tries
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:51.280]   to start doing other things, and he makes a great effort. But the more he does of all these things,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.600]   the worse he feels. The more he faces the word of God and its description of men,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.800]   the more he realizes something about the holiness of God and his eternal attributes,
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:12.480]   the more unworthy and the smaller does he become in his own sight. He reads books about the saints,
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.720]   buys biographies, and as he reads them he just feels that he's not been living at all. And the
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:25.920]   more he tries, God seems to recede into some infinite distance of holiness and absolute
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:33.200]   perfection. And he becomes increasingly aware of the pollution of his own heart and of the evil
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:39.440]   forces that are within him that are dragging him down and bringing him into bondage. Well, here he
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:48.560]   is. The more he does, the more he tries, the further away he seems from God. The further away is he
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:55.840]   from the standard which he now sees. He must apply to himself, and all men must apply to themselves.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:03.040]   And here he is in this awful predicament. He does all he can. He fasts, he sweats, he prays,
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:10.720]   he does good, he does everything, but still he can't find peace. He can't get rid of his past
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:18.080]   life, his past sinfulness. He can't serve God as he would in the present. And he's conscious of
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:26.800]   himself as a complete and an entire failure. And he turns to friends and they can't help him.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.320]   He turns to the world and all its learning and teaching and culture. It can't help him at this
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:39.360]   point at all. And here he is in utter helplessness and hopelessness. Having exhausted all his efforts
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:47.120]   and endeavors, he still feels estranged from God. He's conscious of his sinfulness and unworthiness,
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:56.960]   and he knows that the wrath of God is upon him. And then he hears about this Jesus Christ,
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:06.000]   of whom Peter is writing. And he hears the message concerning him, that this is none other than the
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.920]   Son of God, who left the courts of heaven and all the glory, and came down on earth in the
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:22.320]   likeness of sinful flesh, in order to deal with men just like himself. He hears him saying,
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:29.600]   "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost." He hears this great message,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.920]   which tells him that he is a failure, and that he's right in realizing that. And that it doesn't
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.760]   matter how much he does, nor how long he may try to do it, he will still come no nearer to giving
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:47.920]   satisfaction to God. White writes this message, "You have nothing to do except to believe in this
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.840]   person. This is the Son of God, and he came on earth in order to seek and to save that which
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:02.320]   is lost. He came in order to seek and to save you, and he has done so. He has done so by taking your
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:08.800]   sins, as Peter puts it at the end of the next chapter, in his own body on the tree, that we
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:18.320]   being dead to sins should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes we are healed." He comes face to
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:24.400]   face with this message, that Jesus of Nazareth is the eternal Son of God, and that he came into
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:32.480]   this world to be the Lamb of God, to be the bearer of our sins, to take our punishment upon himself.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:40.160]   And he hears the message, that "whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:49.040]   life." And in his utter helplessness and hopelessness, he believes on him. He casts himself
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.880]   and all his troubles and problems upon him. Now, the important distinction you notice is this,
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.560]   he doesn't merely believe certain things about him. He doesn't merely believe that Jesus was a
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:07.120]   great man or a great teacher, a great moral example, or anything like that. Not just someone
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.240]   whom he's to try to follow, and to admit it, that he may save himself. That isn't what he believes
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:25.040]   at all. He believes on the Lord Jesus Christ. He says, "I rest my faith on him alone, who died
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:32.240]   for my transgressions to atone." He doesn't believe things about him. He believes in him.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:38.880]   He believes on him. He trusts himself and the salvation and the future of his soul
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:49.440]   entirely to him, and to what he has done on his behalf. He says, "I dare not trust my sweetest
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:17:04.240]   frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name, on Christ, the solid rock I stand. All other ground is
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:12.880]   sinking sand." Now, that is what the New Testament means by believing in and on the Lord Jesus
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:19.920]   Christ. Not believing certain things about him. Not regarding him as the greatest man who's ever
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.440]   lived and the greatest teacher, as so many do at the present time. It means that you realize
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:32.320]   that he alone can save you, and that he saves you, not by telling you how to save yourself,
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:41.280]   but by taking your sins upon himself, and bearing their punishment in his own body on the cross,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.440]   on Calvary's hill. He believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the first thing that is of
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:55.040]   necessity true about any Christian. It doesn't matter what else is true about us. If that isn't
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:01.120]   true about us, we are simply not Christians. I say again, we can be members of churches and not be
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.520]   Christians. We can do a tremendous lot of good. We can be very interested in religion. That doesn't
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:18.480]   make us Christians. The Christian is a man who believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, and who knows
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.880]   that it is in that way, and in that way alone, that he is saved from the wrath to come,
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:32.560]   and is reconciled to God. But then the apostle goes on to add to that. The second thing he tells
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:39.120]   us that is true about the Christian is that he loves the Lord Jesus Christ, whom having not seen,
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:49.280]   he loved. Now this is much more difficult, isn't it? I don't think it's very difficult for any man
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:55.600]   who's ever really seen himself as he truly is. I don't think it's at all difficult for a man who
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.480]   has any conception at all about the holiness of God to see the absolute necessity of Jesus Christ
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.960]   and him crucified. The man who hasn't seen his need of a savior is a man who's terribly,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:16.720]   woefully ignorant about God and about himself. Oh yes, I see no difficulty in the absolute necessity
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:22.000]   of believing in the Lord Jesus Christ. But Peter says that that isn't the only thing that's true.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.880]   Whom having not seen, he loved. This takes it up much higher, doesn't it?
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.760]   This is on a much higher level. There is a love toward this person, says the apostle.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:42.320]   And this is a more difficult test, of course, because here it searches us in the depths.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:48.880]   The danger against which we all of necessity have to fight always is the danger of some
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:56.400]   intellectual belief, the danger of some vague believism, of merely saying that we believe in
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.680]   him. But the apostle's argument is this. You can't really believe in him without loving him.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:08.960]   The thing is impossible. Because if you really believe what he's done for you, well then you
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.360]   must inevitably love him. If you don't love him, you're a cad. If you believe that he's done all
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:22.080]   this for you, and you just take it in a detached, almost emotionless, subjective manner, well it
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:31.600]   just means that you've never realized it. Whom having not seen, ye love. And how do we know
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:39.680]   whether we love him or not? Well, we apply the same test in this respect as we do in our ordinary
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:48.080]   daily life and living. We show that we love people not simply by our talk and by what we say,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:56.640]   but very much more by what we do. Love is something that always expresses itself. Our Lord
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:05.040]   himself has defined love for us once and forever when he says, "He that keepeth my commandments,
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:12.160]   he it is that loveth me." The man who keeps the commandments. You know, it's a simple thing for
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:19.280]   all of us, isn't it? To sing some of these great hymns. Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:26.000]   Redeemer's praise. We've all sung it together this morning. Did we mean it? Is your love for him so
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.720]   great that you rarely do feel the need of a thousand tongues? It's a simple thing, I say,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.160]   to say these things for a preacher to say them or anybody else. But my friends, the test of love is
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:47.360]   what we do. Love always shows itself and expresses itself, and it does it in these ways.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:55.280]   Love always wants to spend as much time as it can. Indeed, it would like to spend the whole of its
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.240]   time with the object of its love. Most of you have been in love at some time or another.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.520]   And when you're in love, you want to be with the person you love the whole time.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.600]   And if business or your professional work or anything keeps you away from that person,
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.880]   you're most unhappy. You spend your time in thinking about that person, in longing to be
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.560]   back again with that person. That's love, isn't it? Well, it's the same thing here in our relationship
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:31.840]   to our blessed Lord and Savior. If you love him, well, you want to spend a lot of your time with
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.160]   him. And your thoughts are about him. If we really love him, we'll spend more time with him than
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:44.080]   we will with the television or with any other of the means of entertainment and distraction at this
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.880]   present time. Whom having not seen, he loves us, Peter. You want to be with him. You want to spend
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:58.640]   your time with him. Not only that, you want to please him. When you love a person, you want to
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:05.360]   please that person. You try to anticipate that person's desires. What does he or she like? What
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:12.720]   would he or she like me to do? These are the things that we do always when we love one another.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.160]   We try to please and to anticipate the desires. Well, it's exactly the same here, and that's
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.920]   exactly what our Lord meant. "He it is that loveth me that keepeth my commandments."
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:32.000]   And as the Apostle John adds, "To us his commandments are not grievous." We know that
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.080]   we are Christians because his commandments are no longer a burden to us. They no longer grievous.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   We delight in doing them because it is his will, and we want to please him in all things.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:54.320]   The true Christian doesn't find the various commandments of the New Testament grievous.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:59.040]   People who have to drag themselves to a place of worship on Sunday,
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.440]   what do they really know about him? People who have to force themselves to read the scriptures
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:13.760]   or to pray? No, no. Love expresses itself in these various ways. Indeed, the great characteristic of
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:21.040]   love is that it is always anxious to give itself for the beloved and for his well-being. Think,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.640]   for instance, a simple illustration. Look at that mother with a little child. That little child is
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:33.040]   ill, and the mother looks after it all day. Night comes, she stays up all night. She may do so for a
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.800]   succession of nights, but she doesn't put up a great notice saying how wonderful she is and how
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.160]   self-sacrificing she is. She's not aware of sacrificing anything at all. And if you go and
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:50.240]   praise her and comment on her wonderful sacrifice, she won't understand your language. She won't know
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.360]   what you're talking about. All she knows is this, that this little child whom she loves with all her
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:00.720]   being is desperately ill, and she just gives herself. She doesn't count the cost. She's not
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:09.040]   aware of any cost. The love compels her, commands her, constrains her, and she's not aware that she's
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:16.800]   doing anything at all. My dear friends, the apostle Peter puts this down as a part of his basic
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:25.120]   definition of a Christian. We not only believe in him with our minds, we do, we must start there.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:31.440]   We not only believe in the wonder and the glory of his person and all he has done, we must. You
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.640]   can't be a Christian without having theology, without having doctrine, without having understanding.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:42.480]   A vague feeling doesn't make us Christian. We must know what we believe as well as whom we believe.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:48.800]   There must be understanding. It's here in the New Testament teaching, but it doesn't stop at that.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:56.960]   If we rarely have a true understanding of this blessed person, if we rarely have an understanding,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:05.760]   I say, of what he's done for us, we shall inevitably love him and love him with the whole of our being.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:13.280]   We test our belief by this further test of love. But then the apostle goes on and adds the third
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:22.480]   thing, and the third thing is this, "In whom, though now we see him not yet believing, ye rejoice
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:34.000]   with a joy unspeakable and full of glory." Now this is the highest test of all.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:41.440]   I would urge upon you again the importance of remembering that the apostle here was writing
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:49.280]   about ordinary Christians. I do that because you and I perhaps have read certain biographies of
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:55.120]   certain mystics, so-called, certain saints, certain people who've gone out of the world,
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:01.600]   as it were, who've segregated themselves from society in order to cultivate the spiritual life.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:08.080]   They've said, "You can't do this sort of thing in business or in a profession. You've got to get
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:14.000]   away somewhere on your own." And there in meditation and contemplation, you have to
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.280]   have dealings with the person, and as you do so, you begin to love him and you end by rejoicing in
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.240]   him. But that can't be done in ordinary life. It's quite wrong. The apostle was writing to
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:32.640]   these ordinary Christians, and we gather that most of them were slaves or servants or something like
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:38.160]   that, perhaps in Caesar's household. They were ordinary people. "You see your calling, brethren,"
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:46.160]   says the great apostle Paul, "how that not many learned, not many mighty after the flesh,
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:53.680]   not many noble are called. God hath taken up and hath called the common things of this world,
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.640]   the things that are not, to bring to note the things that are." These were ordinary Christians.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:04.960]   Don't think of them as monks in some cell in a monastery or some hermit in the top of a mountain
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:12.000]   away from the world in solitary... No, no, that's not it at all. They were living in the midst of
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.040]   life in the most humble and the most adverse and difficult circumstances. And yet, says Peter,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.680]   "I know, I don't know you personally, I don't know your names, but I know this, that because you're
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:33.280]   Christians, you rejoice in him with a joy which is unspeakable and full of glory." What terms he
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:40.320]   uses. Notice it. He says that the joy that the Christian has in his Lord, the rejoicing of the
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:48.240]   Christian in his Lord, he says is unspeakable. It can't be put into expression. You may have
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:55.520]   at your commend the vocabulary of the universe. It is inadequate. It is insufficient. He rejoices in
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:02.160]   him with a joy that is inexpressible. Language can't do it. Charles Wesley is perfectly right.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:11.440]   Oh, for a thousand tongues and even they wouldn't be enough. Rejoices with a joy which is unspeakable
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:20.000]   and full of glory. Somebody translates it like this, "a joy which is unspeakable and glorious."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:29.840]   I rather like the comment of old Philip Doddridge, that great preacher of 200 years ago in Northampton,
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.640]   the town of Northampton in England, written some of our best and greatest hymns,
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   and he was a great biblical commentator at the same time. And he said it means this,
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:48.320]   that the joy which the true Christian has in his Lord is the joy of a man who has had some
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.480]   glimpse of the glory. He hasn't had a vision of him, or hasn't seen him as the apostle Paul saw
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:00.320]   him on the road to Damascus, but he does know something about this glory. It's not an ordinary
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:07.360]   rejoicing. It's not a carnal, a bulliant human rejoicing. It's not anything of the flesh.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:15.120]   It is something that comes from the glory. It's a deep, profound joy. You remember the poet,
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:22.160]   I think, said something vaguely similar when he says, "to me the meanest flower that blows
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:30.960]   can give thoughts that too often lie too deep for tears." A joy that is unspeakable and glorious.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:36.480]   This is the attitude of the Christian to his Lord. This is his relationship. Why? Well,
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:42.800]   it's because of what he's done. What else is there to rejoice in? Do you rejoice in yourself,
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.960]   my friend? If you do, well, there's only one answer. You don't know yourself.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.200]   If you really know yourself, you won't rejoice in yourself for long.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:59.360]   The apostle Paul says about himself, "In me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:08.240]   O wretched men that I am!" He didn't rejoice in himself. And no man who knows himself does. It's
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:14.480]   the Pharisee who rejoices in himself and says, "I thank thee, O God, that I'm not as other men are.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.040]   I fast twice in the week. I give a tenth of my goods to the poor. I'm a very good man. I'm a
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.680]   very religious man. I'm very punctilious in my attendance at my place of worship. I'm doing
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:29.600]   well. I'm not like those terrible people that are outside. God have mercy upon such a person."
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:37.680]   No, no. You can't rejoice in yourself, nor in any of your achievements. When you begin to be proud
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.560]   of what you're doing as a Christian, you'll take up perhaps the biography of a man like David
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:48.240]   Brainerd, who lived in this here country. And you see what that man did for the sake of those poor
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.920]   pig and blind Indians. And you begin to read about David Brainerd, and you feel you've done nothing.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:01.360]   There's nothing to rejoice in at all. You can't rejoice in men because they're the same as you
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.800]   are. You can't rejoice in the world and its achievements. It's all going to pass away.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:14.480]   But here is one, who though he was what he was, thought it not robbery to be equal with God,
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:23.680]   but made himself of no reputation. And came in the likeness of men, took upon him the form of a
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:33.120]   servant, and humbled himself. Yes, even unto the death of the cross. Here's the one to rejoice in,
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:40.480]   this blessed son of God, who did all that that you and I rebels, miserable sinners,
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:47.280]   might be forgiven and might be reconciled unto God. And who's gone on to prepare a place for us.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:54.640]   And who has said that he has done so that where he is, we may be also. Well, here you see is the
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:00.800]   position of the Christian. He believes in him, he loves him, and he rejoices in him with a joy which
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:10.000]   is unspeakable and full of glory. My dear friends, have I been describing you to yourself this
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:19.360]   morning? The greatest need of the church today is to be filled with people like this. What we need
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:27.520]   is not formal religion, not formal Christians. No, no. When the church is filled with people like
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:33.760]   this, she'll be on fire, she'll be alive, and she'll attract the masses of the people, as she
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:41.360]   has done in every period of revival and of reawakening. Do we believe in him? I'm sure we
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:50.560]   do. But do we love him? Do we rejoice in him with a joy which is unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.680]   There is no excuse for us if we don't. Ah, but wait a minute, says somebody, are you being quite
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:01.840]   fair to us? You know, says somebody, you are there dealing with the first century Christians.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   And those first century Christians had seen him. You know, says this person,
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:15.520]   I do indeed believe that if I'd been alive and in Palestine when the Son of God was there,
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:21.840]   I believe that if I'd seen him, if I'd had the privilege of looking into his face and into those
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:28.240]   eyes, if I'd had the privilege of seeing his miracles and hearing words such as men never
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:34.960]   uttered, I'd say, would that Roman soldier never man-spake like this man? Not only that, I know,
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.520]   I'd believe in him with the whole of my being. I'd love him, I'd rejoice in him with a joy
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.440]   unspeakable and full of glory. But I've never seen him. If only I could have a glimpse of him.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   But my dear friend, you're quite wrong. Do you notice what Peter says about these people?
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:58.720]   These were not Palestinian Christians. These people had never been in Palestine. They'd never
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:05.440]   lived there. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia,
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:11.360]   Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. They'd never been anywhere near Palestine. They'd never seen him.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:20.720]   He tells us that specifically, whom having not seen, ye love. These people had no more seen him
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:28.080]   with the naked eye than you and I have. That is no excuse for us at all. We should be in this
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.680]   position in spite of the fact that we have never seen him. The trouble with us all is, you see,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:41.360]   that we tend to be like the apostle Thomas. You remember the whole story of Thomas? Thomas
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.840]   had been disappointed by the death of our Lord and he'd gone away off on his own somewhere so
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.600]   that he wasn't there when Jesus appeared to the other disciples. But when Thomas came back,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.760]   they said to him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said unto them, "Except I shall see in his hands
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.680]   the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:13.120]   side, I will not believe." Then you remember our Lord appeared and he chastised Thomas.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:19.120]   Then saith he to Thomas, "Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.880]   thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing." And then poor Thomas answered and
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:32.800]   said unto him, "My Lord and my God." But our Lord didn't let him off at that. Listen. Jesus saith
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:42.160]   unto him, "Thomas, because thou hast seen me thou hast believed. Blessed are they that have not seen
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:53.920]   and yet have believed." There is no need for the heavens to open. There is no need for you to seek
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:01.200]   a vision. There is no need for you to seek something unusual and exceptional. It's unnecessary. You've
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:09.600]   got everything that's necessary in the word of God and the Holy Spirit. Whom having not seen,
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:19.600]   ye love. In whom though now ye see him not yet believing, ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.280]   full of glory. What can we do, says someone? Oh, I'll tell you what you can do. You've got it,
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.520]   I say, here in the word. It is his own word and it is the word about him.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:35.200]   What we need is to give more time to him. We need to seek him in the scriptures.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:41.520]   We need to pray the Holy Spirit to open our eyes. We need to ask him to manifest himself to us.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:48.640]   He's promised to do so. He has promised to do so. That if we keep his commandments, he will come to
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:55.920]   us. He will manifest himself to us. He will take up his abode within us. We have but to seek him
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:04.880]   and to put everything else on one side until we can say honestly, whom having not seen, we love.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.640]   In whom though now we see him not yet believing, we rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:17.360]   You and I need to do what the saintly, godly Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:23.840]   Mission, did every day of his life. When Hudson Taylor died, they found in his Bible a sheet of
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:29.280]   paper which he evidently used as his bookmark. And on that he had written in his own hand this
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:37.840]   little verse, this poem, this stanza. "Lord Jesus, make thyself to me a living, bright reality,
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:48.320]   more present to faith's vision keen than any outward object seen, more near, more intimately
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:39:00.000]   nigh than in the sweetest earthly tie." That was his daily prayer. That was the secret of his life.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:12.320]   "Lord Jesus, make thyself to me a living, bright reality, more present to faith's vision keen
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.560]   than any outward object seen, more real than the building, than the flowers, the chairs,
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:30.000]   more real than any outward object seen, more near, more intimately nigh than even
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:41.040]   the sweetest earthly tie. My dear friends, this is the need of the hour. I hold this before you
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:47.280]   not only for your own sake, not only that you may have the enjoyment of knowing him. I say this is
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:55.200]   the supreme need of the Christian church. We need men and women who know him like this,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:04.400]   who not only believe in him but who love him and who rejoice in him with a joy unspeakable
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:15.760]   and full of glory. May God make of us such men and women to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.440]   Let us pray.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:28.320]   O Lord, our God, we come into thy holy presence. We humbly thank thee for all thy great goodness
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:35.360]   and mercy to us. We are what we are by thy grace, and we realize we'd not be here at all
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:43.280]   were it not that thou hadst looked upon us and called us by thy grace. We thank thee, O God,
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:50.240]   for the faith we have, but yet with him of old we would cry, 'Lord, help our unbelief.'
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:58.480]   Above all, we bemoan the fact that we love thee so little that our love is so cold,
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:05.360]   and that we rejoice so little in thee. O God, keep us from glibness,
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:12.320]   keep us from uneasy familiarity with sacred holy things.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:26.960]   Lord, it is my chief complaint that my love is weak and faint, yet I love thee and adore.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:36.800]   O for grace to love thee more. Amen.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
