[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.180]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.820]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.540]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.900]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.460]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.300]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.780]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.060]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.040]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.920]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.520]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.860]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.300]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.280]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.720]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.760]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.820]   Well, listeners, it is that time of year.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.980]   We are buckling down.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.580]   We are back into the midst of our studies.
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.940]   We are immersed in science fair projects
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.940]   and the beginning of mock trial,
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.580]   the coming up on are we gonna go from memory master or not
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.340]   in foundations and in essentials.
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.860]   We are coming up on the Faces of History project.
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.420]   I feel like a lot of you listeners
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.660]   have a love relationship with Faces of History
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.700]   because it can be a lot of fun
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.660]   for you and for your students.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.460]   But I think that probably some of our new listeners
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.060]   have a little trepidation when it comes to Faces of History,
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.260]   wondering what is this exactly?
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.900]   How can I best help my child?
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.780]   And honestly, can my child really do this?
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.980]   And so I have as my guest today
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.500]   one of our academic advisors, Courtney Bradshaw,
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.140]   and she is going to share some big encouragement
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.920]   with you parents as you prepare your child
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.620]   to participate in Faces of History.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.620]   Courtney, thank you so much for sharing today.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.820]   - Thank you for having me, Lisa.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.520]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.100]   - I'm excited to hear what you have to share.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.100]   I have seen some amazing Faces of History projects
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.560]   come through over the years.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.580]   Sometimes I see them on the Facebook page
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.660]   and sometimes even on the YouTube channel
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.920]   and in my own community.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   And I watch these kids have a blast doing this.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.320]   And I also, I'll be honest,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.240]   I watch some parents start out very nervous
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.980]   about the whole process.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.240]   So I want us to talk all the details
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.640]   of the Faces of History project.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.000]   And I think that you are going to be able
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.820]   to help us see the delight in it,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.860]   both from the parent perspective
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.760]   and from the kids' perspective.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.700]   So I want to start out.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.500]   I want to just lay the foundation
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.460]   'cause some of our listeners might not be
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.680]   part of the Essentials Program yet.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.360]   And they're just kind of looking forward.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.100]   What's ahead, what's my child?
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.940]   So they may not know very much.
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.680]   Give us the purpose of the Faces of History project
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.360]   for students.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.420]   - Well, the Faces of History project
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.420]   is the capstone event for the Essentials Program.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.280]   This is where we celebrate students
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.940]   for all that they have learned throughout the year
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.140]   in their writing abilities.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.740]   So they will take all the things they've learned to research
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.100]   and write a five-paragraph essay
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.480]   about a particular person in history.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And then they will present that to their community,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.820]   as their families, or it can be a big event.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.100]   Sometimes it can be small, depending on the community.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.820]   But the main purpose is that five-paragraph essay
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.460]   and learning to do a research paper.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.060]   And then it's to celebrate the students
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.900]   and what they've learned.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.260]   - Oh, my goodness.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.140]   - Yes.
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.100]   - My goodness.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.840]   Okay, so some, I can picture it now,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.460]   some of our listeners are saying,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.020]   a five-paragraph essay, a research paper,
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.400]   but don't you understand?
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.760]   My child is nine years old, or 10 years old,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.700]   or my child is a beginning writer.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.320]   It sounds amazing.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.160]   And I especially love what you said,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.280]   the purpose of celebrating our students
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.860]   and the growth they've experienced through the years,
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.000]   through the year.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.520]   So parents, listeners, if you are freaking out right now,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.120]   just take a deep breath and calm your heart.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.920]   And we're gonna walk through that a little bit more.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.760]   But I wanted you to know at the outset,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.160]   what is this all about?
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.000]   I love it.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.720]   So we're celebrating the students' growth
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.600]   in writing by letting them,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.840]   well, so all the elements are what?
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.880]   You enumerate them better than I do, Courtney.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.600]   Tell me all the elements of the project.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.240]   - Well, the elements of the project are,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.440]   to begin with, would be writing the five-paragraph essay,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.680]   which they have learned throughout the year.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.500]   This isn't something we're springing on them right away.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.760]   They've built to this through their writing
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.440]   and the Essentials Program.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.560]   - Yes.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.540]   - And then if you choose to do this,
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.100]   it is an optional project.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.140]   If they choose to do this,
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.720]   they may present their character or the paper,
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.600]   whether it be by reading their paper
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   or by choosing to use an outline or a memorized speech
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.760]   to tell what they have learned in their research.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.440]   - Now, I know that some families
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.080]   and some communities get kind of elaborate,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   and I understand, like I had,
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.600]   especially one of my daughters was way into
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.960]   pretending to be different characters,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.780]   and she would really get into it.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.780]   So she wanted costumes and props and all of that.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.800]   Is that part of Faces of History?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.480]   - It can be, but yes.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.020]   When we are presenting, a lot of times the students
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.020]   like to dress up as their character and bring a prop.
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.120]   Sometimes they might even do a tri-fold board to help.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.600]   It depends on the way that they choose to present,
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.040]   because different communities present their characters
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.880]   in different ways.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.880]   Sometimes it is on stage, in front of an entire group.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.280]   Sometimes it may be a wax museum,
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.840]   where people come around to different characters
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.760]   at different times.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.040]   So depending on how the community
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.680]   is celebrating Faces of History
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.440]   will depend on how much the student may want to do,
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.120]   whether an elaborate prop is not for everybody,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.340]   but it can be nice and it can be fun.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.000]   I know my daughter, she and her character
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.800]   based on the costume that she found
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.200]   before we ever even started.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.320]   - Yes.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.880]   You know what, and that is,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.600]   thank you for being honest about that,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.240]   'cause sometimes you do let the props drive the choice,
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.680]   and that can be fine.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   I mean, usually do children,
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.160]   do the students themselves choose?
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.120]   Well, I know that that's part of what parents
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   might help their kids to do.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   When do families usually start working on Faces of History?
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.120]   - Well, the Faces of History project
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.880]   is at the end of the year,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.700]   usually between weeks 19 and 21
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.520]   is when you really buckle down
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.540]   and start working on Faces of History.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.600]   However, a lot of times, starting now,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.440]   over the break, the winter break,
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.200]   or even beginning, now that we're getting back
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.840]   into the groove of essentials,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.580]   they will pick their character
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.520]   and then begin getting to know that character
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.680]   through books and through their research.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.940]   So that's when it begins, when you start it,
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.160]   but nobody's late if they have not
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.320]   even picked a character yet at this point.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   - Yes, that is what I wanted to drill down to.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.120]   What if we haven't started late?
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.640]   Are we just totally behind the eight ball?
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.840]   Is it too late for us?
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.520]   That's very encouraging, Courtney.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.520]   So maybe what parents do now
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.640]   is start asking their children
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.040]   if there's somebody they're interested in.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.720]   How do kids choose their subjects?
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   - Well, a lot of times, communities will focus
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.360]   on the particular cycle that you're in and foundations.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.400]   So they may find something from the cycle
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.640]   of somebody that they have studied
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.320]   or somebody from that time period.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   So like with cycle three, it's a US history focus
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.480]   and geography focus.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.480]   And so they might discover somebody from the United States
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.120]   that they would like to learn more about.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.320]   They also might would pick from someone
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.440]   in the great artists or a composer that we study,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.080]   maybe a famous inventor that does something
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.280]   with the science focus that we have for that year,
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.880]   for that cycle.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.560]   But really, it's about who the child is interested
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.520]   in learning more about, because we know
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.360]   that if a child is interested,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   then they are going to enjoy the whole process a lot more.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.800]   They're gonna enjoy learning more about this person
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.440]   and dressing up if they choose to do that.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.520]   It's just gonna make things easier for parents
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.200]   when the child is interested.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.640]   But the parent has the final say.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.240]   They are the teacher of their child
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.920]   and they have the final say as to who the child will
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.760]   choose to research or not.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.520]   - I like it that you remind us that as parents,
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.920]   we are the teacher at home.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.600]   And so no matter what suggestions the tutor might offer
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.440]   in community or what other families are doing,
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.280]   that the parent does have the final say.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   So what are some of the considerations for us as parents
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:37.680]   to keep in mind when we are helping our children
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.480]   choose the object of their research?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.400]   - This is a great question.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   One of the things that is important for faces of history
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.080]   and for students to be successful, really,
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   is that you wanna choose sources that are at
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.120]   or below their reading level, if possible.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.960]   So sometimes it's not easy to find a source
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.480]   that would fall into that category
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.680]   or someone that your student has chosen.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.440]   So you may have to kind of guide them
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.120]   based on the sources that you're able to find.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.120]   That's one thing I think that's important
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.360]   to think through.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   And then also, as an adult, we know that sometimes
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.320]   things in our histories, in people's histories,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.520]   are not always something that we want to look into.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.040]   And so you wanna be able to guide,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.640]   okay, well, this is somebody that reflects
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.600]   what I want them to learn at this time.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.680]   And maybe even has the characteristics
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.960]   or shows the values or virtues that I would like
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.240]   for them to take from taking a deep dive
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.760]   into someone's history.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.640]   - That is really insightful.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.680]   I really appreciate you doing that.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.680]   It's so easy for our kids to see a flashy representation
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.120]   of a character, whether it's in a book
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.720]   or a story that somebody else has told
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.920]   or a Disney movie or something that they see on television
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.320]   that you know might not be representing the whole story
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.680]   and that there may, when you do a deeper dive,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   as you say, into the research, some things may surface
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.600]   that cause more consternation or concern
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.840]   for the student than you want to deal with.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.880]   I think that's really smart.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.520]   And I do love the wisdom.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.960]   There is so much wisdom in parents thinking
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.880]   through your child's choice.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   Am I gonna be able to find information about this person,
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.440]   like you said, on the child's level?
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.720]   And I do understand that parents could do some
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.800]   of the reading on the child's behalf and condense it.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.400]   - But by and large, what you're teaching the child to do,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.720]   right, is their own research.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.520]   - Yes, and parents can help so much.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.000]   I know there have been times that my own students
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   have chosen a character and we just either did not have
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.560]   the time to read every book that they were using
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.400]   or we chose a little bit of a larger book.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.720]   Sometimes you choose a character that they're only mentioned
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   a little bit in the actual research.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.640]   And so I have just made copies or pointed out the chapter,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.240]   said this works really well with your topic.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.160]   Let's condense the information for you.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.240]   So it is possible to do that.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.480]   And that's where parents are there to help.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.080]   We can't help them too much, as they say.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.920]   - Right.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.440]   - Yeah, especially because, all right,
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.720]   let's put the framework on it.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.840]   These are essentials students.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.200]   So how old, generally, what's the guideline?
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.680]   What's the guideline, Courtney, for the age
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.320]   of the students who are participating?
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.640]   - These students are ages nine to 11 or 12.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.920]   So that's kind of like fourth through sixth grade-ish,
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.080]   which are not, it's not nice and verbal here.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.840]   - Right, exactly.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.360]   So parents, remember that your children are not used
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.480]   to doing research papers,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.800]   like you're thinking about, probably.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   And so the fun part of this is going to the library,
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:09.080]   looking for books about this character that they've chosen.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   And you, as the parent, know that, here's the truth,
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.920]   there's probably not a dozen whole books
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.000]   on the character that you have chosen,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.920]   or likely there won't be in your library.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.240]   So this is a cool opportunity for parents to say,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.240]   well, you know, there's not a whole book on Dolley Madison.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:39.040]   But if we looked in a book about American history,
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.840]   and they, and let me show you, we could look in the index,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.600]   and if we find her name, we know that there's something
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.520]   about her in this book.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.480]   So it's a great beginning to help students
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.160]   go really down to the nitty-gritty level,
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.800]   but then also to back out and look at a book
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.240]   or a resource that might be broader than they think
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.080]   is going to be helpful, and show them how
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.400]   there might be mentions of characters in a book
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.960]   about another subject even.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.200]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.360]   It also gives us a chance as a community to help each other,
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.880]   because I may not have a book about my son's voice,
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.780]   but my friend might, and I might have something
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.520]   that they are using, and so we share.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.560]   That helps that if we cannot find it at the library,
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.920]   we don't have to necessarily purchase a book
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.420]   unless we really need it for our library at home.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:47.320]   So then we can work together within community.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.960]   Also, we do a lot, in my home, we use
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.760]   the classical acts and facts timeline cards,
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.760]   or the science cards, or the ones for art and music,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:05.680]   and those are great places to find information
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.200]   about your character.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   - And see, that might be one of those things
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.920]   that your kids don't think of right away.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.400]   They are so one-track sometimes, they just want,
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.960]   they think they've got to go and find one book
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.800]   that has this person's name on it,
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.480]   and they forget that they have learned or heard
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.200]   about this person, like you said,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.480]   in their classical acts and facts cards,
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.760]   or maybe in a scientist card, and so we are,
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.020]   as parents, one of the things that we can help
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.880]   our students do is learn how to think through
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.700]   their research materials and their options.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.960]   So let me ask you this, Courtney, what are some good,
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.140]   if I'm a beginning parent and I've never done
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.780]   Faces of History before, and I mean, to me,
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.480]   I look at it and it looks like an elephant, okay?
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.080]   I don't know how to eat an elephant,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.180]   I'm not sure how to get started,
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.180]   what are some good mile posts that I as a parent
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:12.200]   can have in mind that will help us stay on track
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.540]   with this project?
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.160]   - Yeah, so we eat an elephant one bite at a time, right?
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.380]   And that was, and isn't that what we are taught?
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.380]   And so in, actually in the Learning Center on CC Connected,
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.680]   there is a Faces of History parent packet
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.140]   that gives a timeline for parents and students
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:38.080]   to walk through to know how, what we should be doing when.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.520]   And so really right now, a milestone is let's pick
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.100]   our character and maybe find one good source
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.040]   that your student could read or that you could
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.420]   be reading together.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:57.120]   When you get closer to doing Unit 8 within your community,
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.680]   which is usually between Weeks 19 and 21,
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:06.960]   then you should have, we use three sources is the goal.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.760]   And so you wanna gather the sources
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.700]   and that's a good one before you start.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.960]   And then follow the steps that you want to earn
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   in Units 6 and 7 to put this together as the paper.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.000]   So the paper itself, the five paragraph essay
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.960]   is the first thing that needs to be done
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.120]   before thinking about the presentation.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.280]   So once we get that five paragraph essay completed,
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:43.280]   then you go back to the essay and actually it is suggested
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:49.160]   to write a keyword outline from your paper for the presentation.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   So if they're going to present from the outline,
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.960]   that's one way to do that.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.480]   But find your character, pick some sources,
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.680]   begin to get to know your character through those sources.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   And then there's, you write, follow the Unit 8,
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.440]   the Unit 6 and Unit 7 and 8 outlines as to what you do.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.540]   So you break that down with three topics
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:23.540]   and then an intro and conclusion for that paper.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.760]   - Boy, see, that sounds like I can feel
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.160]   my blood pressure going down as a new parent.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.280]   I think, okay, those are steps that I could follow.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.440]   I understand what those words mean
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   and I can help my child work the program, work the outline.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.660]   That's really good.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.660]   That is in itself encouraging, I think,
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.320]   to parents.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.760]   Okay, here's what I want to know.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.760]   I want to know what is my student learning
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.720]   by doing this project?
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.480]   Because if it's going to be hard
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.980]   or if my student's going to balk at it,
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.380]   or if my student's going to be really excited,
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.220]   I want to know what is going to come of this?
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.780]   What is my student going to learn?
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.820]   What skills are being strengthened?
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.320]   - Oh, this is a great question
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.220]   because don't we get those questions,
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.820]   why do I need to know this so many times as a parent?
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.240]   Or I do. - Yes.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.460]   - Anyway, so the five paragraph essay,
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.740]   any kind of research will follow them
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.500]   throughout their entire academic career.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.380]   And this is the ground words,
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:46.140]   the skeleton of any research paper that they will do.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.020]   And so they're learning that skill, first of all.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.260]   They're also honing their skill of presentation.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.940]   We work on that in foundations.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.740]   They really get to shine in that time
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.820]   during essentials with their presentation skills.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.820]   But even beyond that, Lisa,
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.220]   they are working on the skills of invention,
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.780]   where they're walking through and discovering
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.060]   who their character is
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:23.060]   and how their character affected those around them.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.740]   And they learn more about the history
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.460]   of all the things that are going around
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.620]   are happening during that time.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.040]   And they are working and learning
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.500]   and utilizing their skills of rhetoric.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.860]   Even at nine years old, they're learning to arrange
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.540]   and they are choosing the best way to present.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.460]   And so that's the skill of elocution.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.460]   And delivery used in really leaning into that storytelling
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:54.900]   that they are so good at at this age.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.780]   - That's true.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.700]   Man, this is all so good.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.860]   And I think it helps us as parents
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.860]   to realize that this is a lot of fun.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:14.300]   It could look like a lot of work,
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.020]   but how much your student is gaining.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.300]   They are building all of these skills
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.300]   a little bit at a time by doing something that's very fun
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.660]   that they get lots of help with.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.180]   And one thing I will tell you,
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.460]   one thing that I think Faces of History
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.500]   builds into students is confidence.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.420]   I have seen some kids come off the stage
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.340]   from their presentation.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.020]   I mean, and this has happened with kids in my own family
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.340]   who were not showmen at heart,
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.380]   but really gave themselves to the project
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.580]   and came off the stage just beaming
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.700]   that they had made it through this presentation
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.540]   and had a good time doing it.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.380]   And it went well and people ask questions and people clapped
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.780]   and people thought they did a great job
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.300]   and their confidence just shot up.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.100]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:19.100]   We had a student one year early on in my CC career
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:25.380]   who she began classical conversations and foundations
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.540]   as a five-year-old and she whispered every presentation
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.780]   to her mom at the beginning.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:37.100]   But when she gave her last Faces of History presentation,
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.700]   she was Queen Victoria and gave it
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.620]   in a full British accent in a memorized presentation.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.580]   And it was phenomenal.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.860]   The growth that we see--
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.740]   It is so cool to see.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.580]   It is.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.060]   Yes, the growth.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.900]   Yes.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.820]   I think that is so cool.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.700]   And you know that little girl is just beaming.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.620]   That is so neat.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.620]   Okay, what about like first young students,
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.860]   maybe they just turned nine, they're on the young end
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.740]   or this is their first time.
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.740]   Is there any way to scale the Faces of History project?
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.380]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.460]   One of the ways that I would suggest scaling
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.300]   would be to pick two topics instead of three
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.020]   so that this might would be a four paragraph essay
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.220]   instead of a five.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.420]   That way they have a little bit less to look through.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.420]   Again, like I said, with parents helping to point out,
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.540]   hey, this chapter goes really well
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.900]   with one of your topics,
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.380]   even helping them to find the facts as needed.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.100]   That's what I do with my students,
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.460]   especially when I had two in there at the same time.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.820]   I had one third year in the first year.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.780]   So sometimes you want to make sure to help
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.420]   so that they don't feel in competition with their sibling
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.180]   or something like that.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:18.100]   But less facts maybe to really try to summarize it
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.260]   a little bit easier.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.860]   So we don't have to have 10 sentence paragraphs,
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.540]   we might have a five sentence paragraph.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.860]   They can make their paragraph.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.700]   Yes, yes.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.700]   Yes, and then also give them a chance with,
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.780]   pick their top three to five things that they loved,
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.100]   that they learned,
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.300]   that they thought was the most interesting
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.900]   from their research to deliver
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.860]   during their presentation time.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.100]   This presentation does not have to last five minutes long.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.900]   It can be a very gentle way to approach that.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.780]   It's scary as a nine year old to stand,
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.740]   it's scary as a 42 year old,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.860]   sometimes to stand up in front of a large group of people,
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.540]   and deliver something that you've researched.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:14.540]   It's nice to be able to help them
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.260]   to pick just a few things that they might want to say,
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.900]   especially if they're trying to memorize a speech.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.580]   It's not required to memorize it.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.020]   So that's a good way to scale it,
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.380]   or even to just pick two sources instead of three,
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.980]   if that's a little bit too much.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.860]   I have found even third years,
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.060]   at least in my home,
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.020]   my third year students at times,
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.980]   they struggled with doing this project,
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.860]   or not doing the project,
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.140]   but doing the research from multiple sources,
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.460]   because they're used to doing it from one workbook.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:57.060]   And so it's the same skill, but it looks different.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.300]   And so there's always a little bit of a learning curve
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.340]   for them.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.900]   So it's not just the first years who get nervous,
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.660]   so that you can tell them that too.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.580]   Hey, you know what?
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.620]   Those kids have done this a bunch of times.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.340]   They might be a little bit nervous as well,
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.580]   and that's okay.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.580]   - Yeah.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.860]   Well, you know, the truth is every time you add a new skill,
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.580]   'cause I had not honestly thought about the fact
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.620]   that we are asking them to have multiple sources
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.140]   of research and that that is different.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.220]   And like you said, even though it's the same skill,
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.940]   it seems different because now I have to synthesize.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.740]   I have to merge this information that I have
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.340]   and how do I do that?
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.540]   And yeah, every time we ask our students
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.720]   to do something new,
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.780]   they have to get used to it
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.740]   before they fully embrace it and feel comfortable.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.340]   That's a really good reminder.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.500]   And I also, I know that you would join me
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:03.500]   in just reminding all of our listeners that as the parent,
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.540]   you are the teacher, you are the decider
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:12.540]   of how the assignments go in your home.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:17.660]   And so scaling is absolutely always an option on the table.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:24.100]   And so whatever you know that you need to do
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.620]   in order to help your child get the very most
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.180]   from this experience,
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.540]   that's what you and your family need to do.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:37.540]   And it may be if you've got two young Essentials students
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:45.700]   that maybe you do research on related characters
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.580]   and you do a lot of things together instead of each student
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.700]   doing everything by themselves.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.940]   - Oh, that's a great idea, Lisa.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.780]   - I wanted to ask you,
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.660]   I know that we're almost out of time, Courtney,
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.140]   but I wanted to ask you a question
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.460]   that has a little bit of a different flavor.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.460]   How can communities use the Faces of History project
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.980]   to raise the awareness of homeschooling
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   or of their CC community or even of just classical education?
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.380]   How could that be an invitation to the community
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.260]   to understand more about what we're doing?
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.180]   - Oh, this is a great time to invite families,
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.180]   to invite your neighbors or your friends,
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.060]   maybe people who are considering homeschooling,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.940]   to invite them to see what it is that we do.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.820]   I think sometimes people might think that
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.580]   if you're homeschooling, you're alone
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.580]   and you don't have community who do big projects for,
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.980]   but we do have that here.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.500]   So we've always invited the pastor
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.020]   and people from our host church.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.260]   - Oh, yes.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.820]   - As well as community leaders to say,
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.060]   would you come and would you help us celebrate
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.500]   these students and see what it is
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.420]   that we have been learning this year?
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.220]   - I love that, I love that.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:17.220]   It does, we always invite the pastors
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.780]   and the other staff members at our church
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.740]   to come and see the science fair
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.940]   and to come and see Faces of History
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.580]   and sometimes to come and see when we do the egg drop
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.020]   and all that stuff, all our big projects,
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.700]   because we want them to know what it is
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.540]   that they are supporting.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:41.540]   And then I love the idea of inviting interested families
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.300]   maybe families who have come to an information meeting
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.820]   or families who have in the last year
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.540]   come to visit your community,
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.540]   invite them back for something like this
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:59.540]   so they can see what the culmination of the year looks like.
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.460]   I think that would be really, really good.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.660]   All right, final encouragement for families.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.660]   Courtney, how can Faces of History be a family affair?
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.700]   - Well, it has to be a family affair
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.340]   that at the end, right, we all push together
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.340]   to really help each other.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.100]   As in our home, we work together to get costumes ready.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.500]   I have, you know, I have older students
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.060]   as well as younger ones, so they help
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.140]   with all the fashion advice that there might be.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.980]   But they practice in front of one another.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:43.300]   You have an audience in your home to practice in front of.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.900]   We invite everybody in our family to come
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.500]   and to watch and to cheer on the person,
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.740]   our family member who's presenting.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.860]   And we celebrate together, we make it a big deal
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   because it is such a fun thing that they've done,
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.580]   but it also is, it's a big thing.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:11.460]   So we try to go out to dinner one night
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.060]   or something that we can celebrate at
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.300]   for finishing and completing their hard work.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.940]   - I like that, making a big deal.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.060]   - We also invite grandparents and dad comes
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.300]   when he's not usually here on community day.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.520]   - That's really good, and I love, of course,
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.220]   it is the perfect time to invite grandparents.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.980]   That is an awesome thing.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.340]   I really like the idea.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:42.340]   More and more, I have really become a proponent
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:45.980]   of families doing the learning together.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.860]   Instead of every level of classical student
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:55.500]   doing their own thing, I love to see the older,
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.900]   you know, the teenagers or the older elementary students
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.300]   helping the little ones, like you said,
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:06.300]   make their costume or find a new book or practice.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:12.420]   Sometimes I know that my older daughter was a better help
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.940]   to my younger daughter sometimes than I was
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.700]   because she was thinking more closely on her sister's level.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.280]   And so she would understand what she really wanted to do
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.540]   with the project or what she was trying to show
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.820]   or what kind of costume she was looking for.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:35.820]   And, you know, we want to use everything that we do
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.400]   in our homeschool to build our family culture.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.700]   And so I think making it a family affair
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.380]   really teaches us to love one another
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.740]   and to show kindness and gentleness
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.220]   and helpfulness and encouragement.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.540]   It's just a great way to love one another.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.780]   - Yes, I agree.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.620]   - Courtney, thank you so much
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.980]   for sharing about Faces of History.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.980]   I think that this has set many a parent's heart at rest,
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.740]   knowing that there's a great purpose for this.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.940]   It can be for fun and that there's so many good resources.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.900]   I love that there's the Faces of History parent packet
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.900]   on CC Connected that will really give you
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.820]   some of the step-by-step milestones.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.340]   I think that's gonna be a great resource for all of us
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.460]   to make use of this year.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.120]   Thank you so much for sharing the benefit
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.660]   of your wisdom with us.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.340]   - Thank you for having me.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:36.340]   - Parents, if you are looking for like-minded homeschoolers,
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.760]   community is the best place for you.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.420]   And podcasts like The Everyday Educator
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.500]   are another great way to build your own knowledge
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.500]   of classical education and to build some online community.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.940]   I also want to let you know that Classical Conversations
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.060]   is constantly striving to build relationships
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.340]   with other like-minded organizations
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.780]   that can help assist you in your homeschool journey
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:11.420]   and really in furthering our mission to know God
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.820]   and to make Him known.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.660]   Lots of the organizations that we promote
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.740]   at the ends of our podcast are organizations
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.940]   that offer exclusive discounts or benefits
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.980]   or even scholarships to CC members.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.140]   Some of the groups that we have relationships with
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:34.200]   are Educational Support and Advancement Services,
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.200]   the Extracurricular Support and Family Culture organization,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.180]   lots of Christian colleges and universities.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:47.000]   We partner with a lot of groups that offer mission
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.180]   and gap year opportunities.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.260]   You guys have heard me talk about Museum of the Bible
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.620]   on here before.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:59.120]   If you want to find a whole list of the groups
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.980]   that we have relationships with,
