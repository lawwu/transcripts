[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.420]   Okay, I'm gonna go over seven mistakes
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.100]   and then I'm going to finally conclude
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.060]   with a case study of a sucker
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.800]   that made just about all of these mistakes.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.860]   It's not you, Rick, don't panic.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.020]   But we buy high, sell low.
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.700]   We forget about arithmetic.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.780]   Kind of like flies, we chase shiny objects.
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.940]   We confuse knowledge with unique knowledge
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.500]   that hasn't already been priced into the market.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.260]   We suspend common sense.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.220]   We create unnecessary complexity.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.760]   And we sometimes speculate instead of invest.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.860]   Now, markets and behavior.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.340]   Here's the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund.
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.140]   Total return, dividends and appreciation.
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.140]   And if you look at when people bought stock mutual funds,
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.620]   sold mutual funds, it's an all-time high, dot-com bubble.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.780]   Cash flow no longer matters, let's get into stocks.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.540]   Then they fall, we sell.
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.340]   Go up, we buy, sell, buy, sell.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.740]   Repeat 'til broke.
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.700]   When I was at Kellogg Northwestern, not Chicago,
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.860]   we were told that you can't time the market.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.300]   But it turns out we are really, really good
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.860]   at timing the market really, really poorly.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.180]   And it pains me to say that we men do it worse.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.860]   We forget about arithmetic.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.500]   If the market earns 10%, guess what the average dollar
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.660]   invested in the market before fees is going to return?
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.500]   10%.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.940]   So if we pay 2% in fees,
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.100]   our expected return is gonna be 8%.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.420]   But of course, you're not really seeing those fees.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.020]   I'm taking them out without you feeling the pain.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.700]   John Bogle would call it the cost matters hypothesis.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.100]   Nobel Laureate, William Sharpe,
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.100]   proves it in a brilliant, incredibly simple
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.140]   three page paper.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.220]   Google it, it's free.
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.780]   The arithmetic of active management.
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.260]   And we do not live and wake Wobegon,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.820]   we're 90% or above average.
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.220]   However, I am one of the 95% of people
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.180]   that think I'm an above average driver.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.220]   We chase shiny objects.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.840]   Anybody hear of Cathy Wood and the ARC Innovation Fund?
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.080]   I mean, it was hot.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.800]   And I saw her in a debate at Morningstar
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   with another advisor kind of on the opposite side value.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.160]   And she was absolutely brilliant.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.960]   In fact, she got me excited about AI.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.440]   This was over three years ago.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.360]   And the returns that would have in the market.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.600]   Brilliant.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.280]   Now look at the blue line is her ARC Innovation Fund.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.640]   Do you see how wonderful it had done when I heard her speak?
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.700]   When do you think money poured into her fund?
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.800]   At the very top.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.240]   She destroyed more money than she ever made for people.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   Now Morningstar does their annual mind the gap survey.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.800]   And you can see that on average,
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.080]   we know that expensive funds underperform the market.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.600]   But we individuals underperform the funds themselves
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.900]   by putting money into what has done well in the past.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.480]   We confuse knowledge with unique knowledge.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.320]   I call it the markets are stupid hypothesis.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.600]   I don't wanna own international stocks.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.480]   There's two wars going on with such turmoil.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.880]   There's a little turmoil here in the US
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.240]   with an election coming up.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.640]   AI is gonna change the world.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.220]   I want more NVIDIA.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.840]   I think that's already priced into the market.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.460]   But I'm gonna show you how I owned NVIDIA from its IPO.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.660]   Do you know how?
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.600]   My total stock index fund.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.940]   As Jack Bogle would say,
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.100]   don't look for the needle in the haystack,
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.520]   buy the haystack.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.420]   The Fed is lowering rates,
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.540]   so I know stocks and bonds are gonna increase in value.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.060]   The Fed doesn't control intermediate and long-term bonds,
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.440]   only the overnight rate, only short-term bonds.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.060]   And they've already announced it.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.500]   It's priced into the market.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.140]   All right, here is where I'm gonna brag a little bit.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.340]   When it comes to making predictions,
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.260]   I am absolutely brilliant.
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.580]   I can predict the past with uncanny accuracy.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.820]   It's only the future I can't do.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.280]   But beyond that, I can't even explain the past.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.780]   Remember when COVID hit?
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.200]   Stocks fell 35% in 33 days
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.100]   between February 19th and March 23rd, 2020.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.620]   I had an asset allocation target.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.340]   And by the way, there is no one perfect method
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.900]   of rebalancing, but I like,
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.840]   you can rebalance as often as you want.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.700]   I have some clients that like to do it very frequently.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.780]   But think of it as a contract
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.780]   where you have to stay within, let's say,
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.660]   if 50/50 is your allocation to stocks,
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.640]   6% tolerance, 6 percentage points.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.320]   If you are below that, you're in breach of contract.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.500]   So COVID hit.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.260]   My life had changed.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.600]   Everyone's lives had changed.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.100]   What did I have to do?
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.560]   Buy stocks.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.440]   Was it easy?
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.280]   Was it simple?
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.100]   Yes.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.940]   Was it easy?
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.760]   No.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.320]   It was incredibly hard.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.760]   And the stock market ended up quickly recovered
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.720]   before a vaccine and ended up having a very good year.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.000]   Now, I had another slide.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.040]   I had to cut that out,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.080]   but it was all the headlines on COVID during the year.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.620]   Things were pretty, pretty bleak.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.600]   Why did the stock market recover?
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.800]   I don't know.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.480]   Because the stock market fools us often.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.100]   Suspending common sense.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.500]   I can get you all of the upside of the market,
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.440]   no downside risk.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.780]   Just sign this 144-page disclaimer document
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.360]   that says you read everything.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.520]   By the way, the disclosure document,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.780]   who's it written by?
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.200]   Attorneys and actuaries.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.240]   Do you think they're doing it to protect their company
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.360]   or protect you?
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.520]   And then market gurus.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.560]   I've been chewed out by Jim Cramer's
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.880]   SVP of media relations twice.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.400]   He's told me that Jim Cramer reads everything
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.280]   I write about him.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.480]   And I said, "Thank you."
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.480]   Or newsletters.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.780]   If I knew how to beat the market,
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.180]   would I be pitching trying to sell you
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.340]   a one-year subscription to my newsletter
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.780]   at $199 a year?
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:30.980]   Creating complexity with a 50-page monthly statement,
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.860]   43 different accounts.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.940]   Simplicity almost always is better.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.260]   Speculating rather than investing.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.060]   Why does gold have value?
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:53.540]   Because people say it has value.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.500]   It's pretty, it's rare, it's shiny.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.060]   Yeah, chasing shiny objects.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.500]   Belly button lint, that's pretty rare.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.220]   It's just not as pretty, darn it.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.100]   Crypto, there are thousands,
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.100]   and Bitcoin is the giant, Ethereum is second.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.900]   It does have some utility value.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.600]   Also has a lot of fraud.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.700]   But it's the same sort of thing.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.860]   Bitcoin especially is rare,
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.620]   but there are thousands and thousands
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.420]   of different Bitcoins.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.620]   I'm coming out with the Roth coin, by the way.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.720]   At the end of the conference,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.820]   there'll be a coupon for 10% off.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.520]   Commodities.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.960]   Commodities are important if you're, let's say,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.060]   an oil company in an airline.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:54.280]   But a few commodities you can actually buy,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.040]   like gold, silver, platinum.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.640]   But my HOA doesn't actually allow me
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.900]   to put an oil storage tank in my backyard.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.820]   So what you're doing is buying commodity futures.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.180]   We're in the aggregate and before fees,
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.120]   not a penny has ever been made.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.660]   All right, I'm gonna show you a case study.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.100]   This is a real sucker.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.660]   It's not Rick.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.960]   Rick, you're gonna enjoy this, 'cause it's me.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.400]   I used to know everything.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   Shortly after I graduated from University of Colorado,
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.880]   my parents were very generous.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.240]   They gave me some money and I was frugal, still am.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.240]   Rather than blow it all, I thought I was investing it.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.700]   So I bought 10 ounces of gold at $684 an ounce.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.360]   It had about a 20% pullback from over 800,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.280]   so I thought I was buying it low.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   Why did I buy it?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.200]   Because we're printing all this money.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.980]   Paper fiat currency was gonna be worthless.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.840]   I was gonna be rich.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   In 44 years, I made over $16,000.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.600]   That may sound like a lot,
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.200]   but it didn't keep up with inflation.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.040]   I lost buying power.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   Had I invested in Jack Bogle's S&P 500 Index Fund,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.920]   how much more money do you think that I would have?
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:44.800]   Raise your hand if it's A, B, C, D.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.880]   D is right.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.040]   Almost a million dollar mistake.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.120]   What was I guilty of?
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.960]   Number one, I thought I was buying low
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.640]   because it went down about 20%,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.320]   but that was over a very short time period.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.800]   I should have had a longer term perspective.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.400]   Arguably, I don't highlight for forgetting arithmetic
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.600]   because it's not the same as the 10 minus two,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.480]   but someone had to sell me the gold.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.400]   The person who sold me the gold
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.220]   did better than me buying the gold,
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.320]   literally chasing shiny objects.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.620]   Confusing knowledge with unique knowledge.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.820]   I wasn't the only one that knew
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.320]   that we were running at a deficit in printing money.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.460]   Suspending common sense,
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.500]   like I'm gonna show up to Safeway
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.600]   and buy milk with my gold.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.500]   Creating complexity, yes, another holding.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.300]   I had to put my safe deposit box,
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.340]   carry with me whenever we moved.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.920]   And confusing speculation with investing.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.480]   Stocks are wonderful.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.400]   Those companies produce products, goods, and services
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.200]   that keep the economy going,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.100]   give us things that have value, create jobs.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.440]   It's wonderful.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.300]   Gold, crypto doesn't do it.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:25.580]   So I should have bet on capitalism.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.080]   And by the way, in that asset allocation,
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.120]   I do push back on my clients
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.300]   because a client, there's two issues.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.360]   Number one, a client may say,
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.940]   I know I have a lot of risk tolerance.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.200]   I'm taking risk tolerance questionnaires.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.840]   I know I'll rebalance when stocks dive
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.100]   versus those that say, I know it's gonna be painful.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.320]   I hope I'll rebalance when stocks dive.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   Which ones do you think actually do it?
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.680]   The ones that understand the financial freedom
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.720]   that has evaporated during a bear market
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.560]   and how they might feel.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.200]   So I also look at need to take risk
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.240]   or as William Bernstein would say,
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.040]   when you've won the game, quit playing.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.600]   Doesn't mean go all in bonds.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.040]   It just means you have a more conservative portfolio.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.320]   Although if you have enough wealth,
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.680]   you're investing for future generations.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.520]   I too have a client in his 90s who's over 90% stocks.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:38.600]   So in eight words,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.920]   investing is simply minimizing expenses and emotions.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.280]   And as Rick said, taxes are part of those expenses
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.840]   and maximize diversification and discipline.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.960]   Simple, but not so easy.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.720]   And remember, we humans are predictably irrational.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.620]   I can't predict the market, but in the next bear,
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.640]   what do you think people are gonna be doing
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.260]   with their stock mutual funds and ETFs?
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.800]   What should you be doing?
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.700]   Absolutely.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.080]   That's it.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.920]   Thank you.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.140]   - Okay, on one clarification.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.580]   When I talked about asset allocation
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.040]   and I asked the client where they think they should be,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.000]   that's the beginning of the discussion, not the end of it.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Because then I listen and we have a conversation about it.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.940]   So I wanna make sure I don't give the impression
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.820]   that we just go with what the client says.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.440]   Anyway, okay.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.180]   Oh, absolutely not.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.020]   Go ahead.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.720]   Believe it or not, sometimes I negotiate with a client
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.820]   with their own money.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.000]   So if they want 70% stocks
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.960]   and I think 60% is more appropriate,
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   what I do is I say, okay, let's start with 60%
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.880]   and when the market is down 20% or more from today,
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.640]   you can buy more stocks.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.620]   I'm not timing the market, I'm testing their resolve.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.400]   Guess how many people have come back to me
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.240]   once we were in that bear market to buy more stocks?
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.040]   Zero.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.800]   (mouse clicking)
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
