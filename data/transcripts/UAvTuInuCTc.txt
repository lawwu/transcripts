[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   Markets are efficient, but they are complex.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.820]   And so based on your individual needs, you can optimize for
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.500]   yourself and outperform for yourself.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.700]   So we talked about liquidity as a good example there, but that's not the only
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.600]   example where some people care more and less about liquidity.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.880]   I think volatility is another good example.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.720]   After I went through my exit, I was talking with an advisor at Goldman Sachs
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.400]   and he said, okay, you know what we can do for you?
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.760]   We will get you half the S and P return for 25% of the volatility.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.200]   And I said, all right, well, how about you give me four times the
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.960]   return for twice the volatility?
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.440]   And, you know, he looked like I had two heads and I thought, you know, this
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.560]   guy has no idea what's going on, but we were both right, but we just had two
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.100]   very different objectives where I said, okay, I don't need this money for 40 years.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.800]   I mean, I would rather a perfectly linear line, but it's not that
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.000]   important to me that's a straight line.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.960]   I care more about where we're going to be in the end.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.240]   In these efficient markets, if you're willing to recognize the things you want
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.680]   to optimize for and the things that you're not trying to optimize for, you can get
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.080]   for yourself a much more efficient outcome.
