[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [Music]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   As you could probably tell from the title of the episode, this podcast is being borrowed for instructions specific to Berean Community Church's All Church Retreat.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I say this from the very beginning because I know there are a handful of you out there who listen to this podcast but don't attend Berean Community Church.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   If that is you, I want to let you know that the entirety of this short episode is dedicated for specific instructions related to our 2021 retreat.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Go ahead and feel free to listen to some other podcasts unless you're somehow intrigued about the intricacies of where we will be staying, how to check out, etc.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   If you are, bro or sis, to be honest, it's a tad bit weird.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So with that said, here's Jason Choi.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   All right, welcome to the first ever audio download for the BCC All Church Retreat.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's time to get this started.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But first, I've gotten questions as to why we're doing this this year.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's for two main reasons.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   First, many of you are driving from far, especially from LA, North LA area.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It takes several hours to get here.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And secondly, after the prayer time, I know many of you are very tired.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So we thought this would be a little bit more effective and efficient for you guys.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So first things first, I want to point to you the main contacts for the retreat.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Any general retreat questions, it's going to be myself and Esther Leung.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   For small groups, it's going to be Pastor Mark.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   For family ministry dinner groups, it's going to be Dean Sin.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   For the BAM and college dinner groups, it's going to be Nathan Corchia.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   For education, any questions related to the education, it's Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Steven Mose will be the contact for Sprouts.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Sarah Kim will be the contact for Nursery and Seeds.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Ryan Chang will be the contact for Youth Group.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Richard Lee will be the AV tech streaming guy.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   If you have any questions regarding any of those, just reach out to Richard Lee.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Pastor Joe will be worship.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And as always, David Rim will be our snacks guy.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Kevin Yoon will be doing the games and activities this year.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And lastly, Cheryl Tang will be the point of contact for First Aid.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   As I mentioned before in the members meeting and in the e-mails we sent out to you guys,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   we will be located in two hotels.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The main site will be at the Westin Mission Hills Golf and Spa.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And the overflow hotel will be the Fairfield Inn and Suite by Marriott.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's about a nine-minute drive between the two, four and a half miles apart.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   If you guys don't know, you should have received an e-mail by now regarding the assigned hotel.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   If you haven't received anything, please reach out to myself or Esther Leung.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   All right, this is the perfect spot for our first Berean history question.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Before I begin, I want to point out a few things.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Pastor Peter Kim, Elder Phillip, Elder Joe, Pastor Peter Chung, Pastor Mark Lim,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   and Elder James Hong are disqualified from answering any of these questions.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And when you guys do answer the questions, please send me a text message.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   My phone number will be posted on the Facebook page.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But when you send me the text message, please put your name in there so that I know who you guys are.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   All right, first question is a $5 Starbucks gift card.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   $5 Starbucks gift card.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   What year did Berean Community Church start?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And what year did Berean Community Church start?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So easy.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   You guys should know this right away. I should be receiving text messages right now.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   What year did Berean Community Church start?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   By the way, I'm not going to give the answers until after the praise and prayer night, so they will be posted on the Facebook page.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   All right, moving on.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Check-in will be at 4 p.m. at the hotel lobby for the rooms.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And retreat registration will be located at the Celebrity Ballroom.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It's going to be directly west of the large fountain at the main entrance.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You can also look for signposts.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You can also ask any representative at the hotel lobby.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   They'll be more than happy to help you.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I would recommend before going to the retreat registration location getting your room number and info
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   and parking close to the room first and unloading all your luggage there.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Parking is free.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   When you check into the lobby, by the way, they will request your credit card info for any incidentals.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Don't worry about it. You won't be charged for anything unless you use room service or do an extended stay.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Second question, $5 Starbucks gift card.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Second question is a $5 Starbucks gift card.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Who was the only pastor to come from outside of Berean Community Church?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   That's a pretty easy question, guys.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Who was the only pastor to come from outside of Berean Community Church?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Again, text me your answers.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Make sure to include your name in the text message if I don't know you.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   All right, moving back to the orientation.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   When you guys do come to the retreat registration at the Celebrity Ballroom,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   there will be a table with program name tags and lanyards.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And we do have retreat shirts for you guys.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   That's something new. It's included.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   The leaders have graciously given it to us for free.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So I hope you guys are excited about that, as I am.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   The programs will have the schedule, the map layout of all the main conference rooms,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and that also will be uploaded on the Facebook page as well, just in case.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   If you arrive early, find a way to get dinner.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   It's a free-for-all until praise and prayer meeting at 8 p.m.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   All right, we have our third question.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's increased to a $10 Target gift card.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Our third question is a $10 Target gift card.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   What was Berean Community Church's previous name?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   All right, moving on back to the orientation.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   For small groups and dinner groups,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   you should have been contacted by your small group facilitator by this time, this audio post,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   and you should already be assigned to a dinner group.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   If you still don't know which group you belong to or you haven't been assigned to one, don't worry.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   The Facebook page will have a list of small groups and dinner groups with photos of the leads.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   If you still can't find your name, reach out to Pastor Mark and he'll assign you to one.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Also, after praise and prayer time on Friday evening,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   we'll give time for you to find your small groups just in case you need to coordinate where to meet.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   All right, fourth question, another $10 Target gift card.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Fourth question, a $10 Target gift card.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   How old was Elder Joe when he first met Pastor Peter Kim?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Ooh, that's a tough one.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   How old was Elder Joe when he first met Pastor Peter Kim?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   All right, moving back to the orientation.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Please make sure to sleep early as there will be a time of devotion every day at 7 a.m.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   The doors will be open at 6.30 in the main conference hall, the celebrity ballroom.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Nursery and seeds will be located in the Rancho Mirage room.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And again, Sarah Kim is the main contact for that.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   She wanted me to note that for the drop-off, the doors will open 25 minutes before each session.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Please plan accordingly and pick up your kids.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   This may require you to leave small group about 5 to 10 minutes early.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   The Sprouts will be located in the Polo room.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And the main contact for that is Stephen Mose.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   The youth group, obviously, they'll be joining the main sessions.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And the main contact for the youth group is Ryan Chang.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Checkout is at 1 p.m. on Sunday.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Please plan accordingly.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   You can drop off your luggages in the meeting rooms.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   All right, this is our fifth question.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And this is a $25 Amazon gift card.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Our fifth question is a $25 Amazon gift card.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Let's see here.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   This one's a hard one, guys.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   All right, what year did Pastor Mark Lim become an intern at Berean Community Church?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   What year did Pastor Mark Lim become an intern at Berean Community Church?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And again, guys, I'm posting the answers on the Facebook page after the praise and prayer night to announce the winners.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Okay, please make sure you text me.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And if you don't, have my contact info to include your name when you text me the answers.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   All right, lastly, Sunday before lunch, we will have an all-church photo at 12 p.m.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Everyone is to meet at the large fountain at the main entrance for that.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And I think that about covers all the main logistical items.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Thank you, guys, and see you all at retreat.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And a special thanks to Elder James Hong for supplying and providing all this equipment so we can do this audio download.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   He also supplied some of the questions, which I really appreciated.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And hopefully, you guys were able to listen to the audio.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Stream quality was okay.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   We know we had some technical difficulties, but hopefully, you guys, it was okay for you guys.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Thank you, guys, again. See you at retreat.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   [Music]
