[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's Friday. Today, live Q&A.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:20.440]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.040]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.880]   to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.320]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.600]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.440]   I am your host.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.480]   Today is Friday, June 18, 2021.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.920]   And today on the show, we do live Q&A.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:53.440]   These Friday call-in shows work just like
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.240]   any other call-in talk radio show
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.680]   that you have ever listened to,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.000]   just a little bit less scratchiness in the background
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.920]   than you get on the AM dial.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.000]   But basically, you call in and we chat about anything
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.560]   that you wanna talk about.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.160]   We talk about questions, comments, suggestions,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.840]   anything that you want to discuss.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.180]   If you'd like to join me on one of these Friday Q&A shows,
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.560]   you can join me by becoming a patron of the show.

[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.700]   search for Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.860]   You'll find the show there.

[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.800]   and that will give you access to these Friday Q&A shows.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.640]   Broadcasting now from the beautiful sunshine state,
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.920]   state of Florida.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.160]   This is my home state in these United States.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.920]   And we'll see, maybe towards the end of the show,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.520]   at the moment I only have a few callers on the line,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.340]   towards the end of the show,
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.020]   I'll talk to you about why I think that Florida
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.360]   is almost certainly one of the best states
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.560]   in the United States to live in, to work in, et cetera.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.400]   It's not perfect.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.200]   I have a few things that I don't love
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   about the state of Florida,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.160]   but we'll save that segment for the end
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.440]   and see if I can persuade you that I think that Florida
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.680]   is one of the best places that you can possibly be.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.200]   We begin, however, with Tyler, who is not in Florida.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.280]   At least I don't think you are, Tyler.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.200]   Tyler, you're in California.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.040]   Welcome to the show.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.160]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.960]   - So I have a question about Michael Burry.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.220]   Michael Burry was one of the early predictors
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.780]   of the real estate financial crash,
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.280]   and recently he's been warning of another crash,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.040]   this one involving crypto and the different meme stocks
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.720]   and everybody going crazy with that.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.480]   Personally, I've stayed out of that section,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.440]   and just 'cause I'm unfamiliar with it,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.080]   didn't want to get into the hype,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.760]   but what's your opinion on, if you know anything about him,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.360]   what's your opinion on the crash that he is predicting,
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.420]   and if there is a crash, what would be the strategy
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.180]   for somebody who is saving up money
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.520]   and could invest in that type of stuff
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.480]   once it does happen, if it happens?
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.000]   - Yeah, for anyone who's not familiar
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.040]   with the name of Michael Burry,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.560]   he reached fame more broadly, I would say,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.640]   through Michael Lewis's book called The Big Short,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.720]   and then the subsequent movie based upon that book.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.800]   He was a very intelligent guy who unraveled,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.440]   basically, as I understand the story,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.760]   single-handedly, just sitting himself.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.000]   He saw the danger in the CDO marketplace
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.200]   back in the mid-2000s.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.120]   He saw what was happening with all of the mortgage companies
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.680]   buying, packaging up, and then reselling as securities
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.480]   all of these really poorly underwritten loans.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.640]   And so he bet extremely heavily against that marketplace
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.000]   and made a ghastly amount of money for himself
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.960]   and for the investors into his fund.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.680]   And that was where he came to public prominence.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.720]   And so I was aware of some of his predictions.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.120]   It was something kind of funky.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.400]   He was talking on Twitter, as I understand the story,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.040]   a few months back, talking about how
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.560]   there's gonna be a crash of the dollar,
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.380]   this, that, and the other thing,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.960]   and then he wound up basically deactivating
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.040]   his Twitter account and somewhat disappearing.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.880]   I haven't heard yet this most recent thing
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.680]   that you're referring to, but I'm happy
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.000]   to answer the question just kind of
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.600]   with a more broad framework.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.320]   Before I do that, do you have any more specifics,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.240]   since I did not read his latest warnings,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.640]   any more specifics on what specifically he said?
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.720]   - Yes, so basically he's been shorting GameStop
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.600]   for a while now, heavily, because of everything
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.760]   that's been going on.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.740]   And he's just saying with all the hype, speculation,
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.400]   and over-leverage of these giant hedge funds
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.920]   who are getting into crypto,
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.000]   getting into the, and everybody else is getting into it,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.140]   that people are just getting over-leveraged
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.280]   and the same thing's kind of happening again.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.760]   - Okay, fair enough.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.760]   So let's begin with people and their predictions.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.000]   I respect Michael Burry and his intelligence
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.800]   and his thoughtfulness.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   I don't know of any reason why I wouldn't
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.880]   respect his intelligence.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.520]   And when people make warnings, I try to listen carefully,
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   especially if those people have previously made good bets
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.840]   and have been willing to put their money
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.080]   where their mouth is, as Michael Burry very famously did,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.840]   because that demonstrates that they've got
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   a good amount of skin in the game
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.200]   and they're ready to make something important happen.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.420]   And so I respect him greatly.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.320]   That said, somebody's being right in the past
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.920]   doesn't necessarily make them more likely to be right
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.640]   or less likely to be right this time.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.700]   And especially in the world of something
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.360]   like stock trading or investment markets,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.040]   you can be an investor
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.760]   and you can see a situation in front of you.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.980]   You can study the situation.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.720]   You can hit the situation exactly right, as Burry did,
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   execute the perfect trade, and yet the next situation,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.240]   the next trade is a fresh new set of circumstances,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.000]   a fresh new set of facts.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.500]   So just because somebody was right in the past
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.560]   doesn't necessarily mean that they're right this time.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.780]   You always have to look at what they're saying
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.740]   and take it on its face and study the evidence.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.640]   I do think that we should give more weight
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.100]   to those who have been right in the past.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.100]   But just because somebody was right in the past
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.900]   doesn't mean that they're right now,
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.540]   just because they have been right before.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.820]   Let me give a more human example
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.600]   to try to drive the point home.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.900]   Let's say that your father encouraged you to go to college.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.420]   And he said, "Son, if you go to college
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.260]   "and you get a college degree,
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.260]   "that will allow you to be more effective in the marketplace.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.160]   "You'll probably have a lower lifetime
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.400]   "level of unemployment.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.320]   "I think it's a good idea for you to go
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.400]   "and get a college degree."
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.180]   So your dad was probably right about that.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.140]   You went to college, got a college degree.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.460]   Maybe you're very grateful
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.880]   that you did get a college degree
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.140]   because, hey, this degree has been useful
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.500]   and I'm likely, statistically,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.280]   to have lower levels of lifetime unemployment
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.420]   than one of my friends who didn't get
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.660]   this particular college degree.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.620]   But then your father comes to you afresh
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.180]   and you're asking his advice
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.420]   on whether you should stay in your corporate job
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.480]   or whether you should leave and start a business.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.060]   The fact that he was right about the college degree
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.840]   doesn't necessarily mean that he's right about the fact
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.520]   that you should stay in your corporate job.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.880]   It's a separate situation.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.920]   And so what you have to do is not say,
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.560]   "Well, dad was right before,
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.400]   "so therefore dad is right this time."
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.800]   What you need to do is say, "Dad was right before
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.320]   "and I thought he had a good idea about that.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.000]   "So let me understand what he's saying this time
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.700]   "and why he's saying what he's saying
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.480]   "and then judge for myself."
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.160]   Because dad could be right before
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.240]   and could be completely wrong now
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.840]   or he could be right now and right before
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.760]   or he could be wrong before and wrong now.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.860]   And so you can have somebody, for example,
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.640]   who makes very poor financial decisions
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.640]   and has no wealth, but then they come to you
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.380]   and they say, "You know, you probably shouldn't buy
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.220]   "this certain thing."
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.160]   And they could be totally right about that.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.440]   So just because it's Michael Burry who is speaking
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.200]   doesn't make what he's saying correct.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.320]   Another example.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.520]   I recently, when I was talking about cryptocurrency,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.280]   I was talking about Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett's
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.160]   perspectives and opinions on Bitcoin.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.320]   And so Charlie Munger very famously deeply dislikes Bitcoin.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.120]   Does the fact that Charlie Munger has been,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.780]   is the fact that he is an amazing investor
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.840]   with a tremendous track record,
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.800]   does that mean that he is right on Bitcoin?
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.440]   It doesn't necessarily mean that he's right.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.520]   What it means is you should listen
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.440]   to what he says carefully.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.600]   So that's the first thing,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.520]   is that when anybody smart says something,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.880]   don't just think that just because he got
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.520]   the other trade right, he's right this time.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.120]   All of us are flawed.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.040]   All of us are fallible.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.200]   Okay, second big warning flash.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.160]   Every single market will have a continual stream of people
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   who say, "This market is a bubble.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.940]   "This market is going to crash."
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.880]   I've personally been paying attention to this stuff
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.560]   for something like 20 years now, 15 to 20 years.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   And I have for many years been attracted to the doomsayers,
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.020]   to those who say, "Everything is going to fall apart."
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:53.060]   When I was younger, I thought they were absolutely right.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.120]   Today, I no longer think that
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   because I've had enough time pass to say,
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.960]   "Look, these guys have been wrong for a long time."
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.560]   But they continue to make the same predictions.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.960]   They continue to just boldly say exactly the same thing.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.760]   And this really bothers me because I wonder,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.360]   number one, are they true believers
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.400]   that they genuinely have believed that they're right
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.280]   in predicting doom and gloom and the crash of this market
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.920]   for a very long time?
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.820]   Or are they just con artists who know
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.200]   that they can continue to say
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.320]   that the market's going to crash,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.760]   and at some point, the market will crash
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.720]   because markets always crash.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.720]   Think back to 2020 and the market declines of 2020.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   It sure looked, during March, April of 2020,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.440]   it sure looked that perhaps all of the bearers were right.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.940]   It sure looked like they were right,
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.360]   like everything was going to come apart.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.880]   I was distinctly nervous myself,
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.580]   very concerned about where certain things could go.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.680]   There was a very good chance, a very plausible scenario,
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.840]   in which you just saw widespread bankruptcies
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.840]   of major companies, widespread economic nightmares
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.480]   all across the board.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.820]   We're very fortunate, extremely fortunate,
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.160]   that the coronavirus pandemic did not turn out
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.720]   to be worse than it was.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.940]   It very easily could have had just simply double
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.640]   the rate of severe sickness and death very easily,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.160]   and we would be in a totally different world today.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.080]   And so when you hear somebody saying
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.360]   there's going to be a crash,
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.280]   recognize that there's always somebody saying
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.160]   there's going to be a crash.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.600]   And almost any market seems to defy that particular crash.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.360]   So whether it's the stock market generally,
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.040]   I've known people since the 1990s
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.640]   who've said the stock market was a waste of time,
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.380]   but the stock market continues to head up.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.060]   Whether it's the US dollar,
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.840]   I've known people my entire lifetime
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.620]   who've been saying the US dollar is going to implode
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.800]   because we're printing too much money,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.600]   and it's all debt, and it's all debt,
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.480]   and the dollar continues to march on.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.080]   Whether it's Bitcoin, there have been people
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.240]   since Bitcoin was $50 a coin who've been saying
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.720]   this is overpriced, this is a nightmare,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.680]   this is all going to collapse.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.600]   Latest iterations, things like NFTs,
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.540]   some of these other currencies,
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.080]   there's always going to be someone predicting them.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   So my answer is, number one, study the market
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.680]   and make your own personal bet based upon the information
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.260]   and the arguments that you see.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.800]   Because at some point in time,
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.720]   you've got to actually put your money where your mouth is,
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.560]   and you've got to make your own bets.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:37.800]   Number two, engage in good personal financial planning
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.600]   so that you don't run the risk of getting wiped out
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.500]   because your bets were wrong.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.240]   One of the things that makes me sad
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.640]   is in the modern world when we teach investing,
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.240]   we don't teach better insurance policies.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.720]   A good professional investor
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.100]   will very frequently cover their positions.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.040]   And they'll buy insurance on any trade
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.660]   that they can possibly do.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.320]   Now you and I might not be a sophisticated trader
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   who's hedging our position on every single trade,
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.740]   but we can do that in our own personal finances
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.280]   fairly easily by choosing the amount of our wealth
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.980]   that we dedicate to a certain thing
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.760]   or by thinking through the scenarios personally.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.400]   So I don't believe,
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.920]   I want to hear what Michael Burry has to say,
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.360]   I respect him, but I want to recognize
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.740]   that he's just one guy.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.960]   He's one guy who made a killer trade,
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.800]   but he's still just one guy.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.180]   And that doesn't necessarily mean that he's right or wrong.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.680]   I want to hear his arguments and think for myself.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.640]   Number two, I want to make my own predictions
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.520]   based upon where I think the world is going
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.400]   and what I think is happening.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.860]   And then finally, I want to protect myself
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.780]   using just good basic personal financial planning
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.420]   so that I don't get overextended.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.200]   And I don't have to have an opinion
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.880]   on what Michael Burry says.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.900]   I can wait and just simply let the marketplace
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.760]   prove him right or prove him wrong.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.200]   That's my perspective, Tyler.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   What do you think? - Thank you, sir.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.040]   Appreciate it.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.120]   Yeah, it makes total sense.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.400]   That's why I don't really like to get
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.880]   into these hype situations,
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.080]   but I see what he's saying to an extent.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.540]   I'm just gonna kind of protect myself
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.360]   and my family as much as I can.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.540]   And I have another question later
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.940]   if you have time for me.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.780]   Yes, go ahead.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.840]   - Okay, I was listening to your Harrison,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.000]   Hurricane Harris episode and the corn
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.360]   that you guys were talking about
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.600]   where it can feed people for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.360]   Because of the pandemic, I have that,
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.960]   when we went into the grocery store,
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.840]   all the food was gone.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.400]   I'd never want that to happen again
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.360]   where we were just underprepared.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.400]   And so we live in a one-bedroom apartment,
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.640]   obviously not a whole lot of room for stuff.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.880]   So if I could get one food item
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   that we can at least stock up on and be ready
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.560]   in case something like that happens, I would like to.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.440]   And so I was trying to find more detail
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.800]   on what kind of corn you guys were discussing
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.880]   and how to prepare it and keep it.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.040]   Do you have any resources for that?
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.480]   - That was just, in that discussion,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.720]   that was just standard feed corn.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.120]   Do you have a tractor supply anywhere near your house?
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.960]   - Yes.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.920]   - So go to tractor supply, look for feed corn.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.680]   They'll have a pallet of it somewhere.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.480]   That's what stuff you guys put in their deer feeders to feed
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.560]   and you can just buy a 50-pound bag of feed corn
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.640]   and that's what it is.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.200]   I'm not sure, however, if I only had a one-bedroom apartment,
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.240]   I'm not sure that I would start there.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.220]   Although, without question, that is one of the cheapest ways
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.580]   for you to just have a bunch of calories.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.240]   I think the most important thing would be learn,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.000]   with something like that.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.900]   So let's pull back for a second, okay?
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.620]   If you have space and are committed to a program
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.820]   of long-term food storage, one of your cheapest ways
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.200]   that you can possibly do that for a very long period of time
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.240]   is to buy for yourself and put up the four basics,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.240]   which are corn, beans, rice, and wheat.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.780]   Corn, beans, rice, and wheat.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.260]   So somebody who is committed to personal preparedness
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.620]   will often just have giant stacks and stacks of buckets
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.340]   of corn, beans, rice, and wheat.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.880]   I think that's great if you have the space
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.540]   to store that stuff and if you have the space to store it
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.660]   and the place to do it and the motivation to actually do it.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.100]   So what I would encourage you to start by
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.500]   is go get one bag and then figure out some ways to cook it.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.980]   A lot of people have never cooked rice and beans
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.700]   from scratch, from dry beans, dry rice.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.060]   Figure out how to cook rice and beans
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.820]   and make them interesting.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.620]   Figure out how to take a bucket of just raw wheat
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.500]   and turn it into something that's edible.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.000]   Grab some corn and figure out how to use it.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.580]   Stephen Harris has a lot of resources on that
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.660]   on his website, lots of recipes and things like that.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.200]   So start with one before you do it.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.980]   I would personally focus on higher value foods
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.420]   that are compact and more easily divided into smaller places
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.460]   before I would go out and buy big bags of corn
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.300]   if I were living in a small apartment.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   So smaller packages, just five pound packages of rice,
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.500]   smaller canned foods, things like that.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.460]   Those are things that are more convenient to store.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.040]   You can tuck them aside into little nooks and crannies,
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.180]   put them underneath the furniture, et cetera,
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.660]   put them in the cabinets and have huge amounts of food
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.860]   on hand without having to figure out
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.380]   what to do with 50 pound bags.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.580]   And then what I would do is have as part of kind of
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.020]   my last hour preparations.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.140]   If you saw that something was happening,
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.300]   then I would have a plan to go and get some of that stuff.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.060]   So if you know that Tractor Supply
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.860]   sells that kind of feed corn,
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.340]   and if you know that you always keep
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.120]   a few hundred dollars in cash on hand,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.100]   if there's an event that's happening
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.220]   and you recognize that this could affect the food supply,
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.900]   then you know the first place I'm going
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.900]   is Tractor Supply with a few hundred dollars in cash
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.880]   and I'm gonna go ahead and load up the back of my car
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.900]   with feed corn and in that situation
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.700]   I'm gonna stack it up high.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.260]   But I wouldn't personally start with that
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.500]   with a one bedroom apartment.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.180]   I would start by just a deeper pantry
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.140]   of smaller, more normal foods that you regularly eat
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.740]   that are shelf stable myself.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.340]   - Wonderful, thank you sir, appreciate it.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.460]   - My pleasure.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.340]   Your big winner also on that subject is going to be pasta.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.460]   So pasta and tomato sauce,
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.100]   that kind of stuff stores really, really well.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.940]   All right, we go to Peter in New York.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.780]   Peter, welcome to the show.
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.260]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.440]   - Hi Joshua, life insurance question for you.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.580]   What's the best way to figure out
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.620]   how much life insurance you actually need?
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.980]   - Do a needs analysis.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.980]   So a needs analysis.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.420]   - What's the easiest way to do that?
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.660]   - Well, let's do it right now, okay?
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.900]   First thing you do is you figure out how much,
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.260]   you calculate how much debt you would want to pay off
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.940]   from your life insurance policy if you died.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.140]   - So do you have any debt that you would want
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.340]   to have paid off for your family if you died?
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.060]   - Yes.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:14.880]   - Okay, how much?
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:24.220]   - Let's say, let's use a round number,
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.540]   let's call it a million dollars.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.820]   - Okay, so a million dollars of debt.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.660]   The second thing is how much cash would you want
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.060]   to make sure that your family had?
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.340]   Not income, we'll get to income in just a moment.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.940]   But how much cash would you want to make sure
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.720]   that your family had in the bank
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.620]   to cover any kind of expenses, one-time expenses,
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.980]   lump sum expenses, funeral costs,
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.780]   emergency funds, things like that?
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.660]   - Let's say 100,000.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.420]   - Okay, now then we look at income needs.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.020]   And there are usually two parts of income needs
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.340]   that a family wants.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.340]   Number one is income for any kind of big picture expenses
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.340]   that are short in time.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.840]   So for example, if you have children,
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.340]   a lot of times a father will say,
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.700]   right now my kid's in a private school,
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.580]   my kid's in fourth grade, I wanna make sure
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.300]   that he has enough money coming in
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.940]   to where he can stay in that private school
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.540]   from fourth grade through 12th grade,
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.700]   and I wanna make sure I cover college.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.540]   So do you have children, and are there any education
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.020]   expenses associated with children
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.380]   that you would wanna cover?
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.980]   - Not yet, but that's coming soon.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.540]   - Okay, we'll come back to that in a moment then.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.060]   And then the second thing is how much income
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.060]   would you want to provide for your wife and children
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.100]   to live on and for how long?
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:41.940]   Any ideas?
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:47.500]   - Probably, let's pick a round number,
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.500]   let's say 250,000 a year for five years.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.720]   - Okay, and then after five years, what would she do?
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.820]   - I would say flex the muscles,
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.580]   she's currently flexing more.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.420]   - Okay.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.500]   - And hopefully we've found someone else by then.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.420]   - Understood, okay, so we'll come back to this
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.160]   in just a second, and then if you did have children,
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.900]   how much money would you wanna set aside
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.220]   for an educational fund?
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.540]   - Oof, man, I'd probably just say,
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.500]   let's just say half a million per child,
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.540]   just 'cause who knows where that's going.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.780]   - So $500,000 per child, and do you have any idea
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.700]   of how many children you hope to have?
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.140]   - Probably just one.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.820]   - Okay, so if we total this up,
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.340]   we wanna pay off a million dollars in debt,
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.140]   we wanna have 100,000 of cash, that's 1.1 million,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.060]   we wanna have $500,000 set aside for educational costs
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.380]   for one child, that brings us up to 1.6,
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.840]   and then we wanna have $250,000 of income for five years,
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.020]   that's a total of $1.25 million of cash.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.300]   I'm ignoring any kind of investment returns
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.580]   in this situation, just to make the math simple.
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.540]   So if we add 1.6 plus 1.25 million,
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.900]   we wind up with $2,850,000.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.500]   So that's our total need, is just under three million,
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.540]   $2,850,000.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.860]   Now, how much money is available,
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.460]   or investments is available now,
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.340]   that if you died, those things would be sold?
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.400]   How much cash do you have,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.200]   how much liquid investment money do you have, et cetera?
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.420]   - And retirement accounts as well?
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.260]   - Yes.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.540]   - And house as well?
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:33.380]   - Yes.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:40.300]   - That is about two million.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.980]   - Okay, so if you have $2 million of stuff
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.780]   that you would want sold for your wife, et cetera,
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.300]   then you just take $2.85 million, subtract $2 million,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.940]   and you wind up with a need of life insurance
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.940]   of basically $850,000, or a million dollars among friends.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.540]   Now, let me, first of all,
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.540]   how much do you earn per year right now?
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:06.100]   - About four.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.220]   - 400,000?
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.660]   - Yep.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.580]   - Okay, so that's probably a little bit light,
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.980]   and let me come back and put on
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.560]   kind of my life insurance advisor's hat.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.100]   The process that we just used is a needs analysis.
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.660]   You simply say, here's what I would want to do,
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.260]   here's what I would want to provide
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.300]   if I died for my family,
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.700]   and then here's what assets we have available.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.680]   And those are the numbers that you can pull apart.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.620]   So if you wanna pay off a million dollars in debt
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.140]   and have those other numbers, $250,000 for five years,
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.860]   there you go, it's $2.85 million.
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.220]   Now, if you want to allocate all of the cash,
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.260]   like for example, does paying off the debt,
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.340]   does that reflect paying off your personal mortgage?
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.940]   And then all of a sudden, your wife's gonna sell the house,
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.380]   what's she gonna do then?
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.900]   Well, then you have to think those things through,
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.340]   talk them through with her, see how much she needs, et cetera.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.060]   But let's say that you said, okay, retirement accounts,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.600]   I wanna make sure that the retirement accounts
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.460]   are still there for her retirement,
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.900]   I wanna make sure that the house is still there
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.380]   for her to live in, and then now,
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.600]   if I provide $250,000 for five years,
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.460]   it feels a little bit better.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.820]   And then, so maybe the number is three million.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.580]   So let me ask you a question, okay?
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.700]   Let's say that you died, sorry,
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.180]   let's say that your wife died, and you have a son,
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.440]   and you're not working.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.460]   Would you feel economically secure
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.340]   with the numbers that you went over?
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.380]   Would you feel economically secure in that scenario,
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.660]   if your wife were the one who died,
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.400]   and she had a million dollars of life insurance,
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.200]   and then you sold all these assets?
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.280]   - And I stopped working. - Right.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:25:00.280]   - I think, yeah, yeah, I think I would, actually.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.680]   - Okay, so if you would,
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.520]   then that may be close to the right number.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.160]   Now, the big kind of blind spots for many men
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.680]   come into these things.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.520]   The first thing is, how long do you want
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.760]   the income for your wife?
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.120]   What I would do is I would try to model the income
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   for her entire lifetime.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.560]   Now, you and she might be different, right?
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.800]   She might be making a lot of money, et cetera.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.340]   There's always variations,
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.580]   and this is probably not the forum to do it.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.360]   But what I try to encourage husbands to do
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.020]   is to make sure that their wife has more income
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.600]   for a longer period of time,
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.640]   especially as that relates to having children, right?
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.280]   My wife is very smart, okay?
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.480]   She's a hard worker, she's very good with money.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.940]   She will, if I die and I leave her a penny,
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.280]   she'll pinch the penny, right?
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.200]   She's good at that.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.840]   The question is this, right?
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.120]   We have a certain lifestyle that we have dreamed of,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.400]   a way of living, a type of lifestyle
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.040]   that we wanna give to our children.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.740]   And so I wanna make sure that if I'm dead,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.740]   she can still accomplish that goal
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.780]   regardless of whether I'm here or not, right?
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.880]   I don't want her to have to worry,
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.240]   okay, for example, we plan to homeschool our children.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.240]   I don't know how long, maybe all the way through
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.680]   their primary and secondary education, I don't know.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.880]   But I don't want her to ever come to a school year
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.200]   and feel like, you know what, we have to go and put,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.560]   I have to put my children into a government school
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.800]   because otherwise we're not gonna have any money.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   That's just unacceptable to me.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.660]   I wanna make sure that she has enough money
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.460]   that she can continue to raise our children
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.040]   in the way that she wants to be.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.240]   If I'm dead and gone, I hope that my wife would remarry.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.800]   I would love it if she would find another husband
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.000]   who she can live happily for the rest of her lifetime with.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.600]   I'd be thrilled to hear that.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.360]   However, I don't want her to be thinking about
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.800]   going and marrying someone else for his money.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.160]   I want her to know that she's taken care of
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.520]   regardless of what happens
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.000]   and if she wants to marry someone else
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.760]   because he's a good fit for her or not, then that's ideal.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.440]   And so these numbers, in my opinion,
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.620]   you're probably a lot below where what would be actually
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.680]   be necessary for your wife to live at your custom lifestyle.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.760]   Now you can play with the numbers
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.960]   just doing the needs analysis.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.240]   How much of a lump sum do I need to pay off debt?
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.440]   How much lump sum of cash?
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.640]   And then how much income and for how long?
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.080]   And then you just simply back those numbers up
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.840]   to a present value analysis.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.800]   But for a guy making $400,000 a year
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.760]   to have a million dollars of life insurance,
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.020]   especially when, you know, unless you're sick
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.180]   and have a heart attack or something,
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.920]   you could probably buy a million dollars of life insurance
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.240]   for something like, I don't know, 40 or 50 bucks a month,
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.760]   seems a little silly to me to not have more of it.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.360]   And so usually when you do this analysis
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.040]   and you really think it through and you run the numbers,
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.080]   usually, unless you're already financially independent,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.600]   you usually wind up with somewhere around 10 to 20 times
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.080]   your income of life insurance.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.840]   Now, if you have not yet accumulated any assets
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.600]   because you're just getting started,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.520]   that number is often 20 times, right?
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.760]   I'll frequently work with, you know,
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.680]   a young doctor just out of residency,
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.320]   making his first time 400,000.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.720]   Well, in his situation, you know,
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.740]   having $6 million of life insurance
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.800]   is not in any way excessive
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.200]   because what he's protecting is the value of his income
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.160]   for his wife and children for a very long period of time.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.500]   If you have some assets,
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.600]   then you start to become self-insured.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.760]   And that sounds like where you are, right?
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.600]   Where you're somewhere on the way to being self-insured.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.120]   And then once you become self-insured,
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.920]   of course, you don't need life insurance.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.300]   But when I look at it and you look at the cost
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.000]   of a term life insurance policy,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.920]   which is just usually quite negligible,
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.520]   then you wind up recognizing
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.440]   that this is probably some of the best money
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.320]   that I can spend just to have
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.900]   a cheap term life insurance policy in force.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.680]   - Okay, sounds good.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.520]   - Let me do a quick--
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.760]   - Should the term--
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   - Yeah, go ahead.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.600]   - Which I was just gonna say,
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.240]   should the term reflect the time
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.540]   that you want the income replacement
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.280]   in this type of analysis, or are they unrelated?
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.460]   - Yes and no.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.080]   So how old are you now?
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.800]   - Ballpark, more or less.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.760]   - Early 40s.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.840]   - Okay, and are you healthy and do you smoke cigarettes?
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.080]   - I'm healthy, I don't smoke.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.520]   - And you live in the state of New York, is that right?
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.280]   - Yep.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.360]   - All right, so let's do a 40-year-old male
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.400]   in the state of New York.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.800]   I'm gonna do an insurance quote here for you.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.180]   And let's do a 10-year term,
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.480]   a 15-year term, and a 20-year term, okay?
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.160]   And let's run this for $4 million of death benefit,
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.840]   okay, 10 times your income.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.280]   No riders, and let's run it at preferred best non-tobacco,
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.760]   the very best rating that you're gonna get, okay?
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.240]   And I'll give you some premiums here.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.600]   So to your term question, so here,
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.080]   for $4 million of 10-year level term insurance
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.360]   for preferred non-tobacco,
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.960]   here's principal insurance company, $1,065 a year
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.720]   for $4 million of coverage.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.160]   Protective, $1,186 per year.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.640]   Lincoln, $1,264 per year.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.200]   Nationwide, $1,395 per year.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.600]   Equitable, $1,595.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.000]   US Life, $1,628.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.560]   John Hancock, $1,800 a year.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.680]   Banner, $1,800 a year.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.800]   Prudential, $2,165.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.520]   So depending on the health rating,
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.600]   you could get a thousand,
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.920]   for between $1,000 and $2,000 per year in premiums,
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.440]   you could get $4 million of term life insurance
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.080]   in force for the next 10 years.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.000]   Does that seem like a lot of money to you?
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.640]   - No. - All right.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.520]   So 20-year term, 20-year term.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.480]   - I mean, the pay outside, the premiums are low.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.760]   - Exactly. - The premiums are ideal
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.600]   for the amount of coverage.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.320]   - Right, okay, so you can get 20-year term, right?
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.520]   And I ran you as a 40-year old,
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.400]   probably a little bit early,
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.160]   I just ran it as a 40-years old.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.040]   A 40-year old non-tobacco, super preferred
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.840]   for 20-year level term with principal,
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.320]   you're at $2,134 a year.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.280]   Equitable, $2,155.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.320]   Protective, $2,214.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.560]   Lincoln, $2,500.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.280]   Nationwide, $3,000.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.900]   So between $2,000 to $3,000 a year,
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.860]   you can get $4 million of 20-year level term coverage.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.760]   So when I look at that,
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.840]   I mean, I've done this so many times over the year,
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.000]   I mean, for a guy making $400,000 a year,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.120]   if I give you the offer and I say,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.080]   "Listen, you write me a check for $2,000 a year,
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.520]   "if you die in the next 20 years,"
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.800]   I stroke your wife a check for $4 million,
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.940]   "if you don't die and we're at $2,000 a year,
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.540]   "max out-of-pocket is every year you're at 2,000,
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.380]   "so 10 years you paid me 20 grand,
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.360]   "20 years you paid me 40 grand."
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.680]   Is that a bad bet to make?
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.240]   Is that gonna wreck your world?
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.120]   - Oh no, absolutely.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.600]   I've spent more money on much dumber things.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.960]   - Right, right.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.680]   And so I always just start there.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.160]   So I like having a lot of life insurance.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.560]   It makes me feel good when I'm doing something dumb.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.120]   It makes me feel good when I'm in an airplane
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.040]   bouncing up and down.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.680]   And even though I know everything about aeronautical science
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.760]   and know I'm pretty safe,
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.840]   I still feel good knowing,
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.160]   all right, if this plane goes down,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.000]   at least my wife doesn't have to worry about money.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.920]   So the amount of time that you have term insurance in force
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.440]   should go for the amount of time
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.720]   that you're really gonna need it.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.400]   In your situation, I'd be okay,
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.080]   based upon what I'm,
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.680]   you've got $2 million in the bank
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.040]   and in cash and investments, et cetera.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.840]   Even 10-year term would probably be fine
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.000]   because chances are, if you still need term insurance
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.160]   after 10 years, you could still get it.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.880]   It's probably not a risk.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.360]   You're probably gonna be in the point
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.440]   where you could easily consider yourself self-insured
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.240]   within 10 years based upon the trajectory you're on.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.360]   And so if you just went with the cheapest,
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.960]   a 10-year term product, that would be fine.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.440]   What I might do in a situation like yours,
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.160]   if I were an insurance agent, is I would do a ladder.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.880]   I would do $2 million of 10-year level term.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.320]   And then I would do maybe a million dollars
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.560]   of 15-year level term
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.720]   and a million dollars of 20-year level term.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.560]   And that would take you to basically retirement age
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.720]   with somewhere between a million and two million,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.320]   depending on how we split those policies up.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.160]   It'll cover you big time for the next 10 years
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.520]   where you're gonna be working a lot, making a lot,
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.440]   and it'll allow you to see where you are 10 years from now
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.320]   in terms of your wealth.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.680]   And so I would kinda do some kind of ladder approach.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.080]   - Awesome, appreciate the advice.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.040]   - Last point, how much life insurance does your wife have?
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.200]   (silence)
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:35.920]   - About half a million, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   - Okay, so I'd love to see you have about half as much,
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.400]   if possible, does she earn income to your household?
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.020]   - Yes.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.440]   - Okay, so if she earns income,
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.320]   if she makes a lot of money, then you need more.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.880]   Okay, but if she doesn't earn any income,
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.740]   I'd love to see her have at least half of what you have.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.920]   And here is why, all right.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.840]   As a high-income male, you would imagine that,
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.000]   okay, if my wife died, I'm still gonna have my career.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.760]   And I think that's probably true.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.000]   I'm the one who generates the income into our household.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.340]   The problem goes back to this.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.960]   My wife and I, we have four children.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.880]   We have certain dreams, certain lifestyle
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.760]   about how we want to live.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.600]   If my wife died, could I keep working?
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.800]   I could, right?
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.120]   But I would have a hard time doing the exact same thing
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.200]   and raising our children the way that we wanna raise them.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.920]   And so it's very hard for me to imagine,
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.560]   hey, you know, guys, mom died,
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.960]   and now I'm gonna keep on working 50 or 60 hours a week,
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.560]   and you're just gonna sit over here in the corner
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.680]   and take care of yourself.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.120]   I'm not gonna go put 'em in a government school.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.720]   Am I gonna hire a nanny?
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.160]   Maybe, but I would much rather not have money
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.640]   be the thing that keeps me going,
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.320]   'cause I'm not going to work on Monday
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.400]   with the same level of energy enthusiasm
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.080]   that I went to work last Monday if my wife dies.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.440]   So it's very important that even if you do earn
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.760]   a lot of money, that you make sure that you still have
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.680]   a large amount of life insurance coverage on your wife,
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.520]   so that if she dies, you can still build
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.000]   the kind of family life that you guys
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.240]   have dreamed of building.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   - Sounds great, thanks so much.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.480]   - All right, my pleasure.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.960]   I guess I just don't see,
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.280]   when we're talking about those numbers,
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.320]   I just don't see why people wouldn't have
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.880]   a lot of term life insurance,
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.040]   unless it's just a principle thing,
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.800]   but when you actually quote life insurance.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.680]   Now, if a guy can't get super preferred non-tobacco
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.800]   and he gets table three tobacco rates,
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.880]   then all of this changes.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.680]   All of a sudden, it's hard to say,
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.880]   yeah, you should spend $15,000 a year
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.320]   to buy $4 million a year of coverage that you don't need,
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.160]   but that's probably not the situation that we're in there.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.560]   Let me finish up today's show.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.840]   We're at 35 minutes and I'm gonna just switch now
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.240]   to let's talk about the state of Florida.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.960]   So my family and I, we've been traveling a lot.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.080]   As you know, we got rid of our house
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.680]   and we have become perpetual travelers now again,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.840]   nomads living out of a handful of suitcases,
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.080]   kind of bouncing around the world.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.120]   In March, we were in Mexico, excuse me,
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.600]   in April, we were in Mexico,
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.640]   in May, we were in Costa Rica,
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.920]   here in June, we are in Florida, back in the United States.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.540]   And I've talked quite a bit about expatriating
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.200]   from the United States, leaving the United States,
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.900]   and it's always interesting to me to come back.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.600]   So let me just share a couple of ideas
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.860]   about the United States and about Florida in particular.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.820]   Having been gone from the United States
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.920]   for almost three years at this point,
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.200]   I am much more at peace with the United States
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.660]   than I was back then.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.480]   The reason that I'm at peace is that
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.480]   I'm no longer reliant on one country.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.960]   What made me incredibly nervous a few years ago
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.600]   was when I woke up and I realized that my future
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.480]   and my children's future was entirely connected
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.840]   to one country.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:15.760]   It was reflected to, connected to a very good country
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.640]   in many ways, the greatest empire in the world at present,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.200]   right, the only empire in the world at present,
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.040]   with tremendous benefits, tremendous opportunities,
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.800]   tremendous blessings, et cetera, but one country.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.480]   And I was sitting, I sit and look at long-term trends,
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.320]   and I look at things like we'd mentioned before
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.960]   about the national debt and things like that,
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.000]   and I just sat and said, it makes no sense to me
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   that my children should be indentured servants
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.720]   to the future of the greatest debtor nation
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.560]   in the history of the world.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.200]   Now, will that debt turn out to be a problem
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.560]   in the long run or not?
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.000]   I don't know, but I think there are good reasons
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.640]   to think that it could be a problem,
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.280]   and if it were a problem, why on earth
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.960]   should my children be burdened with that?
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.480]   There are a number of escape hatches, right?
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.120]   I don't really think that our children
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.680]   are gonna ever pay back any kind of national debt.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.120]   I think they'll default on the debt,
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.640]   and they'll just move on with life.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.520]   And I don't, I'm not a catastrophist.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.000]   I don't think it's gonna be a bad thing.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.360]   Defaulting on debt is not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.520]   But I realize this incredible vulnerability.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.800]   I realize that I and my children are vulnerable,
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.320]   and so for the last three years,
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.040]   I've worked hard to eliminate that vulnerability
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.440]   to the point now where I could divorce myself
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.160]   from the United States if I wanted to,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.040]   and fully divorce, leave, never come back.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.160]   And that feels really good to know
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.760]   that I have that option.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.460]   That feels really, really good.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.260]   Along the way, I've become more peaceful
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.700]   because of knowing that I have that option.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.660]   And so now it's easier for me to come back
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.460]   to the United States and just let some of the stuff go by
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.460]   and come to appreciate so many things about this country.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.780]   Things that a few years ago,
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.980]   because I was so personally, emotionally
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.260]   kind of tied up in knots, I couldn't see as honestly
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.340]   and objectively as I would have liked.
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.900]   But now that my personal emotions have been relieved,
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.620]   that I know I don't have to be here anymore,
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.780]   then you come to appreciate a lot of things
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.540]   about this country.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:25.140]   And I'll share some of those because I want you
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.820]   to appreciate things about where you may live,
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.080]   wherever that happens to be.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.880]   And so I'll just share some of those things,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.480]   speaking generally.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.700]   Financially, the United States is one of the best
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.500]   and easiest places in the world that you can live
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.040]   if you want to get ahead.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:47.940]   This is so underappreciated, in my opinion.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:52.540]   I have lived internationally, I live internationally,
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.500]   I travel internationally.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.580]   I'm interested in the international living approach, right?
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.880]   Where people think about a certain country,
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.260]   a certain place that they can go
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:05.460]   and where they can live better on less.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.580]   But having been to most of those places,
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.260]   I am convinced that if I were a retiree
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.820]   living on a very modest social security income,
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.900]   there is no place in the world that I would rather be
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.340]   than the United States of America.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.320]   I do not see it in any place that I have traveled,
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.460]   including Mexico, other places that retirees enjoy being,
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.780]   places in Latin America, Dominican Republic,
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.500]   and things like that.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.660]   I just do not see a better lifestyle
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.260]   on less than in the United States of America.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.660]   If I had to live on $1,000 a month,
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.860]   I would not want to be in Mexico.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.760]   I would want to be in the United States of America.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.620]   Now, there are a couple of categories
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.820]   that are very difficult to save money on in the US.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.300]   One category is housing.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.060]   But I think that you can save money on housing
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.700]   with more of a creative, strategic approach
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.200]   and by relocation.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.820]   There are areas, right, if I were gonna live in Manhattan
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.300]   on $1,000 a month, I wouldn't want to do it.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.300]   I wouldn't do it.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.660]   In Miami, I wouldn't do it.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.260]   But there are all kinds of places
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.780]   all across the United States
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.020]   that have very low costs of housing.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.820]   Just like there are in other countries,
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:27.380]   there are places in the United States that have low costs.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.420]   And so even if you have a very modest amount of money
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.700]   available to spend on rent,
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.020]   you can find options all across the country
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.300]   if you're willing to relocate.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.200]   And it's a lot easier to relocate from the downtown city
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.880]   to a small country town two hours outside of the city
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.740]   than it is to relocate from the downtown city
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.500]   in the United States to the rural city in Ecuador.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.860]   It's just a lot easier to do,
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.140]   a lot cheaper to get back and forth,
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.180]   a lot easier to relocate,
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.780]   a lot easier to check things out, et cetera.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.020]   In addition, what people are doing right now
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.020]   in the United States is they're solving
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.980]   the housing kind of question
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.260]   with more of a creative approach, right?
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.500]   They're living in a van or in a camper, something like that.
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.340]   And I'm convinced that living in a van
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.260]   is probably a better lifestyle
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.040]   than living in cheap housing in Ecuador
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.500]   or living in cheap housing in Mexico.
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.740]   You can go and you can put up a shack
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.140]   in many places in the world.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.220]   The shack that you cannot build in the United States
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.100]   because of building codes,
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.700]   but you still would be better off with a nice RV
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.500]   or even just a modest RV
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.900]   than you are living in that shack in terms of an adjustment.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.340]   So think carefully about the location
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.940]   and recognize that if housing is expensive
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.960]   where you live in the United States,
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.020]   you don't necessarily have to go to another country
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.060]   because housing is often more expensive in other countries,
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.180]   at least for the kind of housing that you're accustomed to.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.020]   The United States,
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.700]   building supplies are relatively inexpensive.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.300]   There are all kinds of things that you can do.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.540]   And then of course you can live in a more interesting
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.500]   and kind of creative approach.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.380]   Again, RVs are very popular for this.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.700]   There are also lots of ways
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.060]   that you can cut your housing costs, right?
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.380]   You could become a caretaker for somebody of a property.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.420]   You can manage an apartment.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.620]   There's lots of ways that you can cut that.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:22.180]   So while housing costs are often high in the United States,
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.180]   you can adjust them by location
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.500]   and it's easier for you to move from New York
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.300]   or from Pennsylvania to Mississippi
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.940]   than it is for you to move from New York
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.860]   or Pennsylvania to Mexico.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.120]   The second big cost that is high in the United States
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.620]   is healthcare expenses.
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:42.700]   Healthcare expenses are high in the United States.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.820]   And so this is where when people are really satisfied
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.260]   with their international relocation,
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.280]   I often hear them talk about healthcare.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.460]   They talk about how, look, I can afford to live in Ecuador.
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.820]   I can afford to live in Mexico
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.980]   because of the low cost of healthcare.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.980]   And I think that's entirely valid.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.060]   If you are facing some kind of personal situation
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.780]   where that specifically can be adjusted by healthcare,
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:09.060]   by living in another country, then that's worth considering.
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.740]   There are a couple of caveats, however.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.900]   The first thing is recognize
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.180]   you don't necessarily have to move somewhere full-time
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.580]   in order to get the benefits, the lower cost of healthcare.
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:25.380]   I had some dental work done when I was in Costa Rica.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:30.180]   Costa Rica is a very popular dental tourism destination.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.100]   And so if you have thousands of dollars of dental work done,
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.300]   go ahead and grab yourself a plane ticket to Costa Rica
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.180]   and have some dental work done in Costa Rica
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.580]   instead of necessarily in the United States.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.340]   You can do medical tourism in Mexico
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.180]   without living there full-time,
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.540]   without relocating full-time.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.400]   For someone who does have a chronic condition,
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.420]   something for which just one-time medical tourism
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.580]   isn't necessarily the best solution,
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.740]   I think you should be very thoughtful
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.220]   and just make sure that you understand
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.680]   what you're getting into.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.620]   Very rarely do I hear of an international expat
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.380]   who is satisfied with the local healthcare system
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.860]   that's specifically government-run.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.580]   You can go to Russia and you can sign up
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.580]   and become a part of the National Healthcare Service,
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.820]   but very rarely does somebody want to use that.
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.180]   And so your money can go farther in a private hospital,
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.660]   get a higher standard of care.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.580]   Took my children for a doctor visit in Costa Rica
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.100]   and just to get a checkup and whatnot.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.420]   You sit there, it's wonderful, right?
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.260]   You sit and talk to the doctor for an hour.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.520]   It's a totally different scenario
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.820]   and you can easily afford it, right?
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.140]   You're not worried about the cost.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.940]   It's just a totally different thing.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.460]   So those are good, but you have to count in the cost then
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.380]   of the private healthcare options.
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.500]   So that is a really good reason to move abroad.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.540]   I think another good reason to move abroad
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.500]   is if you want to get better care for a chronic condition,
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.740]   things like in-home healthcare.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.900]   I've spoken to people all around the world
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.860]   and for example, one big problem in the United States
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.700]   is how do I provide care for my aging mother,
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.100]   my aging father?
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.220]   Oftentimes to have a 24/7 private duty nurse,
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.660]   that's certainly a six-figure sum,
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.080]   perhaps as much as 130, $150,000 a year
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.860]   for high-quality care.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.060]   Well, you can have a very high-quality,
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:24.060]   24/7 nursing relationship for your aging parents in Mexico
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:28.660]   for a third of that cost and really do better.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.540]   So this is something that is well worth
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:36.460]   paying careful attention to if you're in those situations.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.940]   Beyond that though, I find that a lot of the cost,
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:40.780]   beyond those two things,
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.340]   I find a lot of the costs of living abroad are simply higher
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.060]   and most US Americans do not understand
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.340]   how good they have it in the United States.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.540]   Almost everything you can possibly buy
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.300]   is cheaper in the United States
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.380]   than almost anywhere else in the world.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.020]   Even the good stuff,
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.340]   even the higher-quality products, et cetera.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.740]   The big-ticket items in the United States
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.300]   are cheaper than almost anywhere else, cars for example.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.340]   In the United States,
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   you have such a massive new car marketplace
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.780]   that people are frequently buying new cars,
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.740]   they're buying good cars.
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.420]   Because of that massive new car marketplace,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:26.340]   the used marketplace is extraordinarily robust.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.860]   Anybody who wants to go out
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.620]   and buy a high-quality family minivan,
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.380]   you can do that with 4,000 bucks.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.700]   4,000 bucks, you can find a six-year-old or eight-year-old,
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.260]   Toyota Sienna, Honda Odyssey, something like that,
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.620]   which can last you for years.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.860]   It's reliable, it's safe, it's economical,
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.980]   it's just a wonderful vehicle
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.900]   and it costs practically nothing
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.180]   compared to the costs in many other places.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.700]   The United States has very low import taxes,
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.300]   so the actual cost of a vehicle is low
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.100]   compared to the import taxes in other places.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.540]   So you have this robust new car marketplace
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.100]   that is more robust than most places
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.420]   and that leads to an incredibly robust used car marketplace.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:09.300]   For household goods, appliances,
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.660]   you know, in the United States, it's common
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:12.900]   that when you rent an apartment,
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.780]   it comes with the appliances built in.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.980]   That's not common in many places in the world.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.740]   Many places in the world, you rent an apartment
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.820]   and you have to then go and buy all the appliances.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.000]   And so where do you get a bunch
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.700]   of high-quality used appliances?
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.200]   Well, in the United States, they're very readily available.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.020]   There's tons of good used ones available
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.420]   because there's tons of new ones available that are cheap.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.240]   And so just everything is cheap.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.380]   In the United States, you have a tremendous library system,
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:41.660]   all kinds of free books, free computer access,
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:46.660]   free movies, free music, everything is available for free.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.460]   And so with that internet connection,
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.780]   those DVD collections, et cetera,
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.900]   you can have entertainment that's very inexpensive.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.780]   There are some places in the United States that are unsafe,
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.380]   but in general, you can live most places
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.580]   without worrying too much about security concerns.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.400]   That's a tremendous benefit
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.000]   because in some other places, it's not that way.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.260]   You're gonna wind up having to incur the cost
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.660]   of living in some places in a gated neighborhood
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.840]   or in a place with community levels of security.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.080]   That's not necessary in the United States.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.300]   Cost of cell phone plans, cost of cell phones, right?
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.340]   You can go on OfferUp
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.280]   and grab yourself a very good cell phone for cheap.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:30.320]   That marketplace doesn't exist in some other places.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.660]   And so just on down the list, even food.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:36.140]   Now, food is kind of an interesting variation.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.420]   Calories, you can buy calories in the United States
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.060]   cheaper than almost anywhere else in the world.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.760]   You have subsidized bulk food.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.860]   So if you wanna buy wheat and corn, et cetera,
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:49.220]   I mean, it's just so insanely cheap to buy a bag of flour.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.700]   Specialty foods in the United States certainly cost more,
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.620]   but it's relatively easy for you to adjust them
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.300]   and to get them where they're not even available
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.080]   in many places in the world.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   So I don't plan to move back to the United States right now,
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.940]   but I wanna point out to you just for the sake of honesty
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.980]   that if you're just pining to go away for some other reason,
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.340]   recognize that it probably is pretty good
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.700]   where you are in the United States.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.860]   You can probably live cheaper here
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.820]   than virtually anywhere else that I know of,
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.820]   especially if you know the systems.
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.900]   I've spent a lot of time over the last few years
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.700]   going through government offices and doing this
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.720]   and doing that and going through
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.060]   all these different procedures and whatnot.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.140]   This stuff is so time-consuming.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:40.140]   It is so time-consuming and expensive.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:44.820]   And then I came back and one of the things
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.860]   I've done here in Florida was renew my driver's license.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.540]   I couldn't renew it online at this point,
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.180]   so I had to renew it in person.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.260]   And with the exception of the fact that because of COVID,
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.060]   I had to get an appointment for it,
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:58.400]   it was just in and out and it cost me 60 bucks, right?
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.340]   Done.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:02.780]   It was much more efficient than many other places
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:07.100]   that I have been involved in this kind of
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.700]   bureaucratic approach.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.580]   So I wanna encourage you that the United States
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:15.000]   really is a very good place to live
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.900]   and you can live here cheaper than almost anywhere else.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.620]   Also in terms of business opportunities
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.860]   and opportunities for work, you can make money here
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:26.940]   in ways that you cannot in other places.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.780]   There is plenty of employment opportunities
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.220]   available for you in the United States.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.620]   And that's why so many people who are underemployed
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.300]   all around the world want to move to the United States
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.940]   because of employment opportunities.
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:42.280]   It's just a tremendously powerful and robust market
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.140]   with so much diversity and so much strength.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.340]   There are options all across the country.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.240]   I'm reminded also of that while I think
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.140]   that Americans' confidence and personal freedom
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:00.540]   is highly overrated, there are indeed significant levels
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.620]   of personal freedom that are useful.
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.740]   And so whether it's medical freedom,
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.000]   educational freedom, personal freedom,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.260]   there are high levels of personal freedom that you see.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:14.060]   Now that's been tested a lot during the pandemic
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.540]   of the last year, been really tested.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.940]   And in some places, people failed the test.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.520]   In some places, they passed the test,
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.140]   but that's been really, really good.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:24.940]   Let me talk now about the state of Florida.
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.900]   When you look across the United States,
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.500]   there are, of course, many different regions
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.120]   that you can choose from.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.380]   The reason why most of us live where we live
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.820]   is gonna be because, number one,
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.220]   that's where our family is from,
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.620]   those that we love and we wanna be around them
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.540]   with very good reason.
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.460]   Number two, it's going to be
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.000]   because that's where we earn money.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.740]   That's where our economic opportunities are.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.120]   And these are really good reasons to live where you live.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   But when you wanna look for a good mixture
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.320]   of freedoms, of costs, et cetera,
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   I think Florida offers a tremendous value proposition.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.880]   It really does.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:09.520]   And so you really should seriously consider Florida
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:13.480]   as an option for you if you're thinking about relocating.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.660]   Florida is not the best in everything,
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.500]   but it's very good in many things.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:22.240]   So I care a lot about your freedom,
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.840]   your personal freedom, and your financial freedom.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.640]   Florida is pretty good on the majority of laws
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.420]   that are gonna affect your personal freedoms.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.880]   Things that are important to me,
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:37.960]   things like home education laws, they're not onerous.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:42.720]   Things like child-related laws, they're not onerous.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.600]   Things like gun laws, they're not bad, they're pretty good.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.740]   Overall, you can pretty well be left alone in Florida.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.500]   In terms of the costs, the costs of Florida,
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.960]   no state income taxes, we all know that.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:03.100]   No really just overbearing government costs,
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.060]   for example, we don't have
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.700]   the California Franchise Tax Board, et cetera.
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.220]   It's pretty cheap to start a business,
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.180]   maintain an LLC, et cetera, in the country.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.860]   Most of the costs of things like registering a vehicle,
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.080]   et cetera, are pretty modest.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.580]   Things that are high in Florida,
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.140]   property taxes can be high,
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.980]   especially in the more built-up areas.
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:29.300]   If you're in Dade County, Broward County,
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:33.420]   Palm Beach County, to some extent in Orlando,
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:37.460]   Tampa, Jacksonville, property taxes are not low.
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.940]   That's how the state
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.580]   and the local governments fund themselves.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.820]   But they're not, I don't think, crazy.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.820]   I often will hear, talk to people in the Northeast,
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.140]   talk about their property taxes,
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.740]   and they're much higher than they are in Florida.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.040]   So they're not low in Florida,
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.800]   but they are low in other places.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.860]   And so you can be in other places.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.860]   Right now, I'm in Central Florida,
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.860]   looking out at one of the lakes in Central Florida,
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.240]   and the property taxes on this house that I'm staying in
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.580]   are just extremely modest,
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.780]   even though I've got a lake view right outside the window.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.780]   So a lot of these costs really are pretty modest.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:22.820]   Florida is a wonderful place for wealthy people.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.780]   Again, you have a cultural respect for wealth
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:29.140]   and a desire to attract wealth.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.860]   It's built into the culture.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.660]   It's built into the government infrastructure.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.900]   You have the no state income tax,
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:41.500]   and that is very deeply entwined in the Florida culture.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.940]   I don't see that changing any time soon,
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.700]   because Floridians are used to it,
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.420]   and they're not gonna stand for it.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:53.020]   You have the very good asset protection coverages, right?
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.260]   Complete exemption of your house, right?
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.460]   You can live in a $50 million house
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.340]   on Palm Beach Island or Jupiter Island.
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:00.740]   It's completely protected.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:05.460]   And then that extends to 401ks, of course,
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.700]   on the federal regulation level,
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.360]   but then IRAs, Roth IRAs, 529s,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.600]   cash value life insurance policies, annuities, et cetera,
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.440]   that are protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.980]   There's lots of very good,
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.580]   very robust asset protection laws.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:22.720]   And so on the whole, I think from the legal framework,
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.400]   Florida is very, very good.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.460]   Do other states have something to offer?
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:29.160]   Does Texas have a lot to offer?
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.040]   I think absolutely.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.980]   Does Wyoming have a lot to offer?
[00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.360]   Without question.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.760]   But what Florida has that a lot of those other places
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.540]   don't have is a much more interesting culture,
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.300]   cultural variety.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:46.820]   If you wanna live the flashy downtown lifestyle,
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.560]   you'll be so comfortable in Miami.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:54.560]   If you want to live the kind of hometown redneck lifestyle
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:58.200]   and go gator hunting and fishing every day,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.680]   you'll love Belle Glade or Cluiston.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.480]   If you wanna live the laid back,
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.360]   white sandy beaches lifestyle,
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:10.040]   but in the city, you'll love Tampa, Clearwater.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.920]   If you want the laid back old Florida,
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.920]   Apalachicola will treat you so well,
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.560]   or Tallahassee, or something that's like that.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:23.080]   If you want kind of the interesting built up city,
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.240]   you've got Jacksonville.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.880]   I mean, if you want theme parks, you wanna go to Orlando.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.600]   If you want beautiful rolling,
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.300]   like things that remind you of the rolling hills
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.640]   of Kentucky and horse farms,
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.240]   you've got, what's the town south of Gainesville,
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.240]   where you just have this incredible equestrian lifestyle.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:47.640]   So there are options, even up to North Florida,
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:50.720]   if you want more cool, if you don't like the weather,
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.680]   right, you don't want the heat and the humidity.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.440]   That is the downside of Florida,
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.760]   the heat and the humidity during the summer.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.560]   Well, you can't get away from the heat and humidity
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.780]   in North Florida, but you can get more
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:05.120]   of the cold inland scenario up in North Central Florida.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.520]   So it's a huge state.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.500]   The Keys has a totally different lifestyle to offer.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.100]   So the more time I've spent traveling
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.960]   around the United States, looking at these options,
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.880]   more time I spend traveling around the world,
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.540]   more impressed I am with my home state.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.200]   And I really think it is well worth your consideration
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.960]   if you're thinking about relocating somewhere.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.720]   Florida is extremely well connected, right?
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.620]   If you do business in the Americas,
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:38.780]   I think South Florida is a tremendous place to be based.
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.140]   You have connections in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:43.180]   In Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:46.140]   you have two massive international airports
[00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:49.220]   that reach the world very, very easily.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.580]   Palm Beach International is good
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.300]   for US connections as well.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.900]   But with Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.860]   you've got connections to every Caribbean island,
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.940]   every Central and South American country for cheap, right?
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:01.920]   For cheap.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.420]   We flew from Costa Rica to Fort Lauderdale
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.920]   on Spirit Airlines, one of the low budget airlines
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   for 100 and something dollars a ticket.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:11.780]   That's phenomenal to have one-way tickets
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.160]   back and forth to Central America.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.360]   South America is cheap,
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.440]   well connected all through South America.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.960]   Obviously you can hit Europe directly.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:21.320]   I'll be flying out of Miami directly into Paris
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.440]   in a few weeks.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.680]   And so on Air France, it's well connected to Europe.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.240]   And so it's pretty well connected
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.760]   in yet most of the countries within striking distance.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.800]   You can fly to, there've been times in the past,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.280]   I flew to New York in the morning one time
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.680]   and flew back in the evening.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.320]   So if you've got business in the Northeast,
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.800]   you can genuinely make it a day trip
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.840]   on one of the commuter flights.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.080]   It's really, really very good.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.300]   You can fly directly from Palm Beach to JFK.
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.480]   Small airport, fast to get in and out.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.600]   Don't have to arrive at the airport too much in advance.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.440]   It's just a really convenient place to go.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.220]   So I don't have any agenda
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.880]   other than just to share with you what I observe
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.340]   and try to be honest.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.480]   I think that sometimes people are so gung ho
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.320]   on getting out of the United States
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.960]   that they don't honestly appreciate
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.060]   the things about the United States.
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.080]   And so I feel like that kind of honesty
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.040]   should be represented.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.840]   Thank you so much for listening to today's podcast.
