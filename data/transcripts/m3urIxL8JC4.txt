[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   I hope that you're doing well in the Lord
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.280]   and that you're enjoying the blessings of Christ.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.960]   It's just been a joy to walk through these topics with you.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.780]   And I trust that you've been stretched
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.560]   and also challenged in your own studies of God's word.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.080]   And we just look forward to seeing the fruit
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.080]   of your study in the word of God.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.040]   And I'm just privileged to be a part of your lives
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.760]   and your training in biblical counseling.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.540]   So tonight we have a wonderful topic.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.020]   We're looking at theology exam number 12.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.960]   We're looking at the dual natures of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.400]   Just a incredible topic that I trust will be,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.280]   first of all, just a blessing to our own souls,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.480]   just to be reminded of Christ and who he is,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.200]   his saving work and all that he has done for us.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.960]   It's always good to take our eyes off ourselves
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.420]   and to set them on Christ.
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.680]   And we hope to do that in this hour.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.000]   And I do hope that this will be a training time
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.560]   for us to think through the implications
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800]   of this doctrine for biblical counseling
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   and how we offer our counselees something
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.720]   that the secular world could never offer,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.320]   which is the saving message of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.640]   I think it was Heath Lambert who said
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.480]   at one of the ACBC national conferences
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480]   that ACBC is distinguished in its counseling methodology
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.940]   in that we not only allow our counselors
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.540]   to talk about Christ and him crucified
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.740]   in the counseling sessions,
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.100]   we require our counselors to talk about Jesus Christ
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.940]   and him crucified.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.700]   And I don't think it could be said any better than that.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.140]   We are distinguished as a counseling movement
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740]   by our focus on Christ,
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.160]   our desire that the message of Jesus Christ
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.900]   would be magnified and communicated
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.880]   to each of our counselees.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.640]   We are distinguished by our reliance upon Christ
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.780]   and all that he has done for us.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.720]   We offer our counselees the hope of Christ
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.640]   and that distinguishes biblical counseling
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.320]   from every secular methodology
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.800]   that's being practiced in the world.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.000]   So I think we're in for a wonderful time of study tonight.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.580]   And thank you again for joining us.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.780]   Thank you for your faithfulness in God's word.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.580]   I wanna begin with just a devotional thought
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.300]   from John chapter one, verses one to 14.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.180]   And I can't, it doesn't get any better than this.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.580]   This is one of the most familiar
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.860]   and wonderful sections of scripture
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.360]   that just speaks of the incarnation,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.340]   the glory of Christ and his coming to earth
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.900]   as a man, the addition of the nature of humanity
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.540]   to his deity.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.180]   And we'll just read this passage together
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.900]   just to set our minds on the topic
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.060]   that we're looking at tonight.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.380]   John chapter one, starting in verse one,
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.940]   says in the beginning was the word
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.740]   and the word was with God and the word was God.
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.500]   He was in the beginning with God.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.220]   All things were made through him
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.200]   and without him was not anything made that was made.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.840]   In him was life and the life was the light of men.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.620]   The light shines in the darkness
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.180]   and the darkness has not overcome it.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.740]   There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.520]   He came as a witness to bear witness about the light
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.140]   that all might believe through him.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.360]   He was not the light,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.300]   but came to bear witness about the light.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.020]   The true light, which gives light to everyone
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.660]   was coming into the world.
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.260]   He was in the world and the world was made through him,
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.300]   yet the world did not know him.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.020]   And then in verse 11, it says,
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.660]   he came to his own and his own people did not receive him.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.420]   But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name,
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.500]   he gave the right to become children of God
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.980]   who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.420]   nor of the will of man, but of God.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.020]   And the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.900]   And we have seen his glory,
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.500]   glory as of the only son from the father
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.180]   full of grace and truth.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.260]   It's what an amazing statement that is,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.260]   that the word became flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.860]   That's a glorious topic that we're gonna look at tonight.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.860]   And that is the subject of theology exam number 12.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.460]   And just some thoughts to prime
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.420]   the pump for our study tonight.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.380]   This amazing truth of the incarnation
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.020]   that the word became flesh and dwelt among us
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.920]   has been called the greatest miracle
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.380]   in the history of the universe.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.300]   And I can't think of a message or a miracle
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.140]   that would be greater than this,
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.300]   that the person of Christ, the eternal son of God
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.540]   would take on an additional nature,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.740]   the nature of humanity.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.820]   This has to be greater than the parting of the Red Sea.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.980]   It has to be greater than Elijah
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.780]   calling down fire from heaven.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.760]   This has to be greater than the apostolic healings
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.420]   performed in the early church.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.860]   The fact that true sinless humanity
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.860]   was joined with undiminished eternal deity
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.860]   in one person forever
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.300]   has to be by far the greatest miracle
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.020]   in the history of mankind and the history of the universe.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.900]   And I hope that gives you some motivation
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.500]   to write essay number 12.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.180]   You're writing about the greatest miracle ever
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.020]   in the history of the universe.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.860]   This is the assessment of Wayne Grudem
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.540]   in his systematic theology.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.420]   He says that the fact that the infinite, omnipotent,
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.480]   eternal son of God could become man
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.540]   and join himself to a human nature forever
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.260]   so that infinite God became one person
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.340]   with finite man will remain for eternity
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.500]   the most profound miracle
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.220]   and the most profound mystery in all the universe.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.580]   Just think about what Wayne Grudem is saying there
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.060]   as he reflects upon the glory of the incarnation.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.060]   He says that this mystery of perfect humanity
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:59.500]   joined with eternal deity in one person
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.820]   will remain for eternity
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.820]   the most profound miracle and mystery in all the universe.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.140]   I believe that 10,000 years from now
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.140]   when we are in heaven worshiping the lamb, the son of God,
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.380]   we will still be in awe and in wonder
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.340]   at the fact that we are worshiping the man Christ Jesus
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.780]   as he is called in 1 Timothy 2, verse five,
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.420]   the man Christ Jesus.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.180]   It's not that Jesus came down to earth
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.420]   and took on a human nature.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.460]   And then when he ascended to heaven,
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.940]   he sort of shed that human nature.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.220]   He was exalted to heaven and ascended to heaven
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.780]   in glorified humanity
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.580]   so that 1 Timothy 2, verse five calls him,
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.320]   even today he is the man Christ Jesus,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.500]   perfect humanity and perfect deity in one person.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.860]   And Grudem says, we're never gonna get over that.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.620]   I mean, we're gonna be in awe and in wonder
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.100]   thousands of years from now
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.100]   at the fact that we worship the man Christ Jesus.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.840]   And so this is gonna be the theme of our worship
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.100]   and the theme of our praise.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.100]   J.I. Packer has said it this way,
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.160]   that the mystery and the incarnation is unfathomable.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.780]   We cannot explain it, we can only formulate it.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.120]   The supreme mystery with which the gospel confronts us
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.060]   is that he took humanity without loss of deity
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.380]   so that Jesus of Nazareth
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.580]   was as truly and fully divine as he was human.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.560]   I'm so many counseling implications in that statement,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.520]   but I'm gonna restrain myself for a moment here.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.320]   Packer continues, here are two mysteries
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.740]   for the price of one,
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.100]   the plurality of persons within the unity of God
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.100]   and the union of Godhead and manhood in the person of Jesus.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.780]   It is here in the thing that happened at the first Christmas
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.320]   that the profoundest and most unfathomable
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.160]   depths of the Christian revelation lie.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.600]   And the good news that we have for our counselees
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.720]   and for ourselves is you don't have to wait till Christmas
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.200]   to celebrate this truth.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   You can celebrate this truth each and every day of your life
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.200]   that Jesus Christ is the perfect God-man,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.620]   perfect deity and sinless humanity.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.200]   I just wanna encourage us pastorally for a moment,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.000]   just give some practical applications
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.960]   before we look at the handout proper.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.280]   And I was just reflecting on this this week
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.680]   that we live in a world of distractions
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.320]   and I hope you agree with that assessment
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.540]   that we live in a world that pulls our attention
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.880]   in so many different areas.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.560]   If we are not intentional about what we're gonna focus
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.000]   our minds and our hearts and our affections on,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.640]   our thoughts and our focus will be pulled
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.680]   in a hundred different directions.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.760]   And that's just in the first 15 minutes of the day.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.000]   This is a world of distractions
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.480]   and I just wanna encourage us
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   that we need to make a conscious decision each and every day
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.800]   to focus the majority of our thoughts and our energies
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.480]   and our affections on the truths
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   which are most important in this life.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.240]   And you may have heard the categories
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.460]   that there are primary doctrines in the Bible
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.080]   that they distinguish a believer from an unbeliever.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.160]   And then there are secondary doctrines
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.800]   that good and golly Christians disagree on,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.760]   doesn't make you a Christian if you disagree
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.120]   or agree or disagree with a certain doctrine
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.320]   doesn't make you a non-Christian
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   if you disagree with a secondary doctrine.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.040]   But this teaching that we're looking at tonight,
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.480]   the dual natures of Christ,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.000]   this is not a secondary doctrine.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.560]   This is a primary doctrine.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.840]   This distinguishes a believer from an unbeliever.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.360]   And if you believe that Jesus Christ
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.020]   is fully God and fully man.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:44.860]   And so it demands our full attention,
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.240]   it demands our greatest concentration of thoughts,
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.460]   and emotion.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.460]   I mean, if you're more engrossed in the cat videos
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.420]   that your kids are showing you on YouTube
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.540]   than you are with the doctrine of the incarnation,
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.620]   then there needs to be a realignment
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.740]   of your focus and your priorities.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.220]   And I just say that 'cause my kids show me cat videos
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.180]   on their YouTube and you can get distracted
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.920]   with kind of the trivialities of life
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.760]   or you can choose to focus your thoughts
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.600]   and your attention on the greatest realities
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.480]   in all the universe.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.840]   And this has to be one of the greatest realities
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.120]   in all of the universe,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.920]   that we worship the God, man, Jesus Christ.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.240]   And I hope you will find that the writing of this essay
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.520]   will be a great blessing to your soul
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.560]   and also equip you for counseling ministry.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   I hope to get to spend some time in the end
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.020]   to talk about some counseling implications
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.460]   of this doctrine.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.320]   But I do wanna encourage you that this is a wonderful study.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.760]   So let me pray for us briefly
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.140]   and let's get into our handout for tonight
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.060]   and I hope we'll be blessed.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.940]   Father, thank you for this time around your word.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.800]   Thank you that we can come and just focus our thoughts
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.580]   and our minds upon the glorious truth of your son,
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.580]   who he is, the greatest realities in all of the universe,
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.380]   that the word became flesh and dwelt among us,
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.980]   that Jesus Christ is our perfect savior and substitute.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.520]   We thank you that because of Christ,
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.060]   that we have hope to offer to our counselees.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.580]   We have hope to offer to our communities.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.820]   We thank you that we have hope to offer
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.580]   to those who are weighed down by sin,
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.060]   to those who are struggling with the trials of life.
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.900]   We thank you that because of Christ,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.540]   that Lord, we can enter into the counseling ministry
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.780]   and trust that you will use us by your grace
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.220]   to make us effective and that the glory
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.100]   will not belong to any of us,
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.100]   but will belong to Christ forever and ever.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.300]   And so we just pray that you would help us
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.780]   to think through this topic carefully,
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.940]   biblically and clearly, give us your grace.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.980]   And I thank you for my friends and my brothers and sisters
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.460]   here and their faithful study.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.700]   And I pray this in Jesus name, amen.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:21.580]   Okay, let's dive into our theology exam number 12.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.180]   And I put on your handout on the first page,
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.220]   a number of good resources that I think
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.680]   will help you in your study.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.700]   The question is, describe the dual natures of Jesus Christ
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   and explain why this reality is crucial for salvation.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.500]   And we'll walk through an approach to writing this essay,
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.300]   but just note there that the standard systematic theology,
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.140]   such as Paul N's Moody Handbook of Theology,
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.860]   Wayne Grudem, Heath Lambert and Charles Ryrie
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.540]   all have excellent sections in their works
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.060]   dealing with the doctrine of the incarnation,
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.580]   the doctrine of the hypostatic union,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.000]   which we'll talk about tonight.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.500]   And Heath Lambert does have a good section
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.180]   in his Theology of Biblical Counseling,
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.260]   dealing with the counseling implications of this doctrine.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.820]   And so all of those resources
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.020]   are worth your careful attention.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.700]   Wayne Grudem in particular does an excellent job
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.060]   walking through the hypostatic union
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.500]   and the inadequate understandings of the hypostatic union
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.940]   and how that doctrine was carefully formulated
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.220]   in church history.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.080]   And we'll do a brief summary of that tonight,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.500]   but I wanna commend his section
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.700]   in systematic theology to you,
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.700]   that that is a section that is worth reading and cherishing
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.660]   and committing to your own understanding
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.780]   for your own blessing.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.280]   If you move to page two of your handout,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.540]   we have a section just introducing
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.980]   the dual natures of Jesus Christ.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.380]   And the key point here is that Jesus Christ
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.380]   was fully human and fully divine in one person.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.360]   So that's what we're talking about
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.460]   when we're articulating understanding
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.740]   of the dual natures of Christ,
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.980]   you want to articulate an understanding
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.180]   of the full humanity of Jesus Christ,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.960]   that Jesus Christ was fully human
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.140]   in every sense of the word.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.620]   He was sinless humanity.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:41.180]   It was not merely Christ physicality that made him human.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.340]   So you may have heard the saying, God in a bod,
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:51.020]   the idea of Jesus was only human
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.100]   in so far as he had a physical body.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.220]   And it was sort of like there was this divine mind
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.780]   and a divine soul placed in a human body.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.300]   And that is what John 1, verse 14 meant
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.340]   when it said that the word became flesh.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.860]   Well, that would be an inadequate understanding
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.760]   of what happened in the incarnation.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.260]   It's just, it's not merely that Christ had a physical body,
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.320]   he was fully human yet without sin.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.360]   And so the first nature of Christ
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.140]   is that he was fully human.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.260]   He had a fully human nature,
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.420]   and that was joined to the second nature,
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.900]   which is the nature of full divinity.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.860]   And so any articulation of doctrine on this subject
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.360]   will convey an understanding of the full humanity of Christ,
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.460]   the full deity of Christ in one person.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.460]   That's the key element there.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.480]   It's not that there was a human person and a divine person,
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.620]   and they sort of coexisted in one body
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.740]   and wrestled with each other.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.780]   That's not an accurate understanding
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.460]   of what happened at the incarnation.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.660]   Jesus Christ was and is one person,
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.540]   both fully human and fully divine,
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.540]   so that what could be said of one of the natures of Christ
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.780]   could be said of the person of Christ.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.620]   He is not a divided person.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.460]   He is one person with two natures.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.140]   And so you have the key point there
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.880]   that the divine nature did not diminish his human nature.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.880]   His human nature did not diminish his divine nature.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.500]   And the union of Christ deity and humanity in one person
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.420]   is the greatest miracle in the history of the universe.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.440]   So let me jump from your handout to the screen here.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.740]   And I just wanna give you a practical approach
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.060]   to writing this essay.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.540]   I would say there's four basic elements
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.820]   that you would need to articulate
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.460]   if you are gonna be faithful to the truths
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.860]   that this essay is asking you to write about.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.940]   The first element would be the humanity of Christ,
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.260]   just articulating a full understanding
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.500]   of the sinless humanity of Christ,
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.980]   and we'll walk through some material
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.540]   in the next few minutes,
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.660]   dealing with the human mind of Christ,
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.820]   the human soul of Christ, the human emotions of Christ.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.900]   It was more than mere physicality,
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.620]   although that was essential part of Christ's humanity.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.660]   It was more than that.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.940]   He had a physical body.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.380]   He had a full human nature.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.500]   A second element is to articulate a full understanding
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.820]   of the deity of Christ.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.140]   Jesus is God.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.460]   He is the second person of the Trinity.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.900]   He is co-equal with the Father,
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.940]   co-equal with the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.940]   All of the attributes of deity belong to Christ eternally.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.700]   And so you will want to articulate a full understanding
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.660]   of the deity of Christ.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.660]   The third element would be the union of the two natures,
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.980]   or what theologians call the hypostatic union.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.660]   You will want to articulate some understanding
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.900]   of how the humanity of Christ and the deity of Christ
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.460]   were joined together in one person.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.820]   And that is, as I mentioned,
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.660]   what theologians refer to as the hypostatic union.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:50.260]   This is a truth that we'll look at in a little more detail
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.740]   at the end of today's session,
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.780]   but that would be a third element you will want to include
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.820]   in your writing of this essay.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.940]   And then the fourth element
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.460]   is what the question is asking for.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.060]   Why is this reality crucial for salvation?
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.620]   Why was it necessary for Jesus Christ
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.620]   to be both fully human and fully God
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.380]   in order for salvation to be brought to the world?
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.380]   In other words, if Jesus Christ were to be fully human,
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.020]   but not fully God,
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.340]   would he have been able to pay for our sins at the cross?
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:37.260]   That's kind of the reasoning behind this fourth element.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:42.100]   If Jesus Christ had been fully God, but not fully man,
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:47.100]   would he have been able to pay for our sins at the cross?
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.340]   Would he be our perfect substitute if he was not fully human?
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.860]   And so the fourth element here
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.540]   is you want to articulate some understanding
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.300]   of it was necessary for Jesus Christ
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.220]   to be both fully human and fully God
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.180]   in order for him to be the perfect substitute for sin.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.660]   Only a man can stand in the place of a man.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.340]   And also he had to be God
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.900]   because only a sacrifice of infinite value
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.900]   could fully satisfy the holy wrath of God against our sin.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:30.300]   It had to be that the sacrifice was more than human.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.860]   Had to be a human sacrifice
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.740]   'cause a substitute had to be a man
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.060]   standing in place of a man,
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.460]   but it also had to be a sacrifice of infinite value
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.100]   so that the wrath of God could be fully satisfied.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.340]   And you want to articulate some understanding
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.060]   of how the dual natures of Christ
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.060]   relate to the work of Christ on the cross for our sins
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.100]   and why that reality is crucial for salvation.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.220]   Okay, so I know that's a lot.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.740]   That's four basic elements,
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.300]   and we'll walk through those in the next half hour or so
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.020]   as we go through the handout.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.100]   But I just wanted to give you some markers here
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.620]   so that when you sit down and write your essay,
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.820]   you're gonna ask yourself this question is,
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.060]   how do I articulate an understanding of Christ's humanity?
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.780]   How do I articulate an understanding of his deity?
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.940]   How do I articulate an understanding
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.700]   of the union of the two natures?
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.700]   And then why is this reality crucial for salvation?
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.620]   That would be a basic approach to writing this essay
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.620]   is make sure you hit on those four basic elements.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:48.460]   So let's walk through those elements together.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:54.100]   This is sort of near the middle of your handout on page two.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:59.580]   Paul Enns has this very clear articulation
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.900]   of the definition of the word incarnation.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.860]   He says the word incarnation means in flesh
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.460]   and denotes the act whereby the eternal son of God
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.900]   took to himself an additional nature humanity
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.620]   through the version birth.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.740]   The result is that Christ remains forever unblemished deity
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.420]   which he has had from eternity past,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.300]   but he also possesses true sinless humanity
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.700]   in one person forever.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.700]   That's a very clear statement of what the incarnation means.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.300]   It means that the eternal son of God
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.420]   took to himself an additional nature humanity.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.500]   It's not that Jesus lost his divinity
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.060]   when he was born to the Virgin Mary.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.020]   It's that he retained his deity
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.600]   which he possessed from eternity past.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.320]   And he took to himself an additional nature humanity.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.820]   The incarnation is not the subtraction of deity,
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.500]   it's the addition of humanity.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.500]   So that's a very good definition for the incarnation.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:23.940]   The Athanasian Creed is a statement
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.200]   which communicates an understanding
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.340]   of this glorious reality.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.740]   It says, "Our Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God,
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:36.740]   "is God and man, perfect God and perfect man,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.480]   "who although he be God and man,
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.120]   "yet he is not two, but one Christ,
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.000]   "one not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   "but by taking of the manhood into God."
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.260]   And there's an amazing mystery in that statement
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.780]   and yet I think we understand what J.I. Packer meant
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.780]   when he said, "We cannot fully understand this truth,
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.500]   "but we can articulate it clearly and accurately."
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.840]   It was the taking of manhood into God.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.840]   It was the addition of humanity to the nature of deity.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:23.340]   The incarnation then concerns not the subtraction of deity,
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:27.300]   but the addition of a full nature of humanity
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.500]   to the person of Christ.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.920]   And as Wayne J.I. Packer has said,
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.860]   "Christ was not now God minus some elements of his deity,
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.620]   "but God plus all that he had made his own
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.580]   "by taking manhood to himself."
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.620]   And as a church father, Gregory said,
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:55.620]   "Remaining what he was, he became what he was not."
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.460]   And so Christ is the perfect man
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:06.620]   and worthy of all of our worship.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.380]   And he is at the same time a full deity.
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.900]   He is fully God and he never ceased
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.040]   to be God in his incarnation.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.900]   Some other quotes here.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.340]   I don't think this is on your handout,
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.060]   but I thought these were helpful quotes
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.180]   to help us understand the incarnation.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.980]   Matt Perman has said this,
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.120]   "It should be obvious that if Jesus is God,
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.880]   "then he has always been God.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.160]   "There was never a time when he became God,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.100]   "for God is eternal.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.260]   "But Jesus has not always been man.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.660]   "The fantastic miracle is that this eternal God
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.740]   "became man at the incarnation
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.540]   "approximately 2000 years ago.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.580]   "That's what the incarnation was,
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.240]   "God the Son becoming man."
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.900]   And as Grudem has well summarized,
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.800]   "We may summarize the biblical teaching
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.000]   "about the person of Christ as follows.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   "Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man in one person
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.760]   "and will be so forever."
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.880]   So if you move to the page number three of your handout,
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.980]   this is the element of the humanity of Christ.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.980]   And I just have a listing here of the number of truths
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.420]   from the scripture which testify
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.420]   to the full humanity of Christ.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.540]   Remember, it is not merely Christ's physicality
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.140]   which made him human.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:48.220]   He had a human mind, a human body, a human soul.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.260]   We see letter A, he had a real physical birth.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.580]   Luke two, verse seven says,
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.460]   "She gave birth to her firstborn son
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.880]   "and wrapped him in swaddling cloths
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.660]   "and laid him in a manger
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.340]   "because there was no place for them in the inn."
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:07.560]   Just think about that for a moment,
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.560]   that the one who rules over the universe in power
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.300]   was completely dependent upon Mary and Joseph
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.920]   in Bethlehem in his humanity.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.840]   Just the tremendous paradox there
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.000]   that Christ was sustaining the universe
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.280]   by the word of his power
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.280]   and at the same time he was a helpless babe in his humanity.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:40.000]   That is the essential core of the gospel message,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.580]   the two natures of Christ in one person.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.880]   We say that he had a true physical body.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.920]   This body grew weary.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.480]   This body became hungry.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.940]   Jesus died a true physical death at the cross.
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.960]   You will remember the story of Jesus
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.760]   with the disciples in the storm on the boat
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.640]   and Jesus is found fast asleep on the stern of the boat.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   He was so exhausted by the ministry events
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.740]   of his public ministry that just physically he was exhausted.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.100]   It was a true physical body.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.740]   And you see that in Matthew chapter four
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.920]   that Jesus fasted 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.520]   He became hungry and the tempter came and said to him,
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   "If you are the son of God,
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.560]   "command these stones to become loaves of bread."
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.760]   I just want you to note that that was a real temptation
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.680]   because of Christ's physical body,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   he was extremely hungry after fasting 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:57.360]   And so this temptation to act outside
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.320]   of the will of his father and to command the stones
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.600]   to become loaves of bread was a very real temptation
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.500]   for the God man, Jesus Christ.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.880]   My theology professor, Dr. Larry Pettigrew
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.720]   explained it this way.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.600]   If you have a wooden rod that is welded inseparably
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.960]   to a strong piece of iron, you can take that wooden rod
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.040]   and strike it against a hard object.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.960]   Because it is welded to a very strong piece of iron,
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.040]   the wooden rod will not break.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.520]   However, because it is a wooden rod
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.560]   and it's being struck very forcefully,
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.020]   that rod will feel the full force
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.000]   of the blows that are being made.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.560]   And that is an illustration of how the humanity of Christ
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.420]   and the deity of Christ were joined together in one person.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.320]   Jesus Christ, because he was fully God, could not sin.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.960]   And yet Jesus Christ, because he was fully man,
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.720]   could feel the full force of the weight
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.360]   of the temptations to sin.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.580]   And that's why Hebrews 4 verse 15 says
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.720]   that he is a sympathetic high priest
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.600]   who is able to literally feel the same things as we are,
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.900]   to sympathize with us, because he has been tempted
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.940]   in all things as we are, yet without sin.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   This has marvelous hope for our counselees
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.520]   and those whom we minister to.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.880]   But it goes back to the fact
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.360]   that Jesus had a true physical body.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   And so those temptations that he experienced,
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.720]   especially in Matthew chapter four,
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.300]   were very real temptations.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:59.120]   And we don't wanna minimize the force of those temptations.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.480]   Letter C, he had a human mind.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.840]   That's a mystery as well.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.840]   Mark 13 verse 32, "But concerning that day or that hour,
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.520]   "no one knows, not even the angels in heaven or the son,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.780]   "but only the Father.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.340]   "The mystery of the truth that Jesus Christ
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.440]   "possessed the attribute of omniscience,
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:27.440]   "and yet he did not know the day or the hour of his return."
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.440]   So that indicates that Jesus had a human mind
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.100]   that we see in his childhood,
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.340]   that he is developing in wisdom, he is growing in wisdom.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.620]   Those are remarkable statements
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.320]   of the human mind of Jesus Christ,
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.600]   developing and growing as a five-year-old
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.880]   will progress to a six-year-old,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.760]   seven-year-old, eight-year-old.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.120]   Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.100]   and in favor with God and man.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:05.560]   Letter D, he had a human soul and a human spirit.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.340]   Jesus said, "In the garden of Gethsemane,
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.020]   "my soul is very sorrowful, even to death.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:14.640]   "Remain here and watch with me."
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   Just a counseling note there that I believe that truth,
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.400]   that Jesus experienced sorrow in his soul
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   to the point of death equips a biblical counselor
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.800]   to minister to the grieving.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.880]   And if you are a biblical counselor
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.480]   who is able to minister to the grieving,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.120]   you will have wide opportunities to minister
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.880]   because we have many in the church
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.600]   and many in our community who are struggling
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.560]   with grief over the loss of a loved one,
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.560]   grief over the diagnoses of different illnesses.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.480]   Just sorrow is a part of this world
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   and Jesus experienced sorrow in his soul.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.760]   He was a man of sorrows.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.360]   He was acquainted with grief.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   And so to understand that truth of the soul of Christ,
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:15.320]   experiencing human sorrow equips us to minister
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.440]   to those who are grieving.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.840]   Letter E, he had human emotions.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.760]   This is a related truth.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.400]   One of my favorite passages speaking of Jesus
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.840]   is John 11, verse 33, that says,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.720]   "When Jesus saw her weeping
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.020]   "and the Jews who had come with her also weeping,
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.600]   "he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.100]   "And he said, 'Where have you laid him?'
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.740]   "They said to him, 'Lord, come and see.'
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.420]   "Jesus wept."
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.100]   He didn't preach a sermon.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.820]   He didn't give a lecture.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.500]   He knew when to grieve and simply weep with those who weep.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.500]   That's the full humanity of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   And then letter F, human development, Luke 2, verse 40,
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.840]   "And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom,
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.220]   "and the favor of God was upon him."
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.500]   Verse 52, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.940]   "and in favor with God and men."
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:21.060]   Hebrews 5, eight says, "He learned obedience."
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.660]   Yes, the question, how did Jesus learn obedience
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.180]   when he was perfect deity?
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.260]   How did, why does the writer of Hebrews say,
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.620]   "He learned obedience?"
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.920]   I believe the best explanation of that
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.620]   is that Jesus Christ, when he was five years old,
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.620]   obeyed God perfectly as a five-year-old human.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.980]   When he was eight years old, he obeyed God perfectly
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.920]   as an eight-year-old human.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.720]   When he was 20 years old, he obeyed God perfectly
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:04.300]   as a 20-year-old human and so forth and so on.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.780]   At each point of the human development of Christ,
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:12.780]   there was at the same time progression in his obedience
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:19.800]   and perfection in his adherence to the law of God.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.000]   There was progression because he was continuing
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.640]   to develop as a human.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.400]   There was perfection because at each point,
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.900]   Jesus Christ was without sin.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:35.000]   So he learned obedience.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.200]   He grew in wisdom and in stature,
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.840]   just these marvelous truths about our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.700]   And then letter G, he had characteristics of a human being.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:52.760]   Matthew 13, verse 53, it says that those in his hometown
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.840]   were astonished and said, "Where did this man
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.940]   "get this wisdom and these mighty works?
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.780]   "Is not this the carpenter's son?
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.620]   "Is not his mother called Mary?
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.500]   "Are not his brothers James and Joseph
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.560]   "and Simon and Judas and not all his sisters with us?
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.940]   "Where then did this man get these things?"
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.440]   And they took offense at him.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.260]   You notice no one said in this passage,
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.140]   "Well, I knew it all along because when I played
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:25.140]   "with him as a five-year-old, he had a halo over his head."
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.300]   Nobody said that.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.660]   Is this not the carpenter's son?
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.620]   Doesn't he have brothers, James and Joseph,
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.860]   Simon and Judas, at least from an outward human perspective,
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.340]   there was nothing to distinguish Jesus
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:45.340]   from the others who were living in the hometown of Nazareth.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:51.460]   In fact, Isaiah 53, verse two says this,
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.340]   "For he grew up before him like a young plant
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.260]   "and like a root out of a dry ground.
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.780]   "He had no form or majesty that we should think at him.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.740]   "And no beauty that we should not desire him.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:08.300]   "He had the characteristics of a human being.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.380]   "He looked like everyone else in Nazareth.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:18.520]   "And yet he was sinless, perfect humanity.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.980]   "He was tempted as we are yet without sin."
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.420]   Now, each of those elements, I mean,
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.580]   we could go on and talk through that.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.540]   The full humanity of Jesus Christ,
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.940]   but I just want to pause for a second here.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.380]   I know I'm gonna run out of time, but just for a second,
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.880]   I just really need to encourage you
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.300]   as those who are preparing to be counselors,
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.060]   that the doctrine of Christ's humanity
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:53.020]   is incredibly useful in counseling ministry.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:57.700]   This is a precious doctrine
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.980]   that really gives hope to our counselees,
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.300]   to encourage them that Jesus Christ
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.300]   is a sympathetic high priest,
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.500]   that he understands what you're going through,
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.620]   to encourage counselees
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.900]   who are walking through a season of grief,
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.700]   that Jesus understands you.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.740]   He sympathizes with you.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.300]   He knows sorrow.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.980]   He's walked through it in his earthly incarnation.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.620]   He walked through this world.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.460]   He wept at the grave side of Lazarus.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.380]   He was sorrowful to the point of death,
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.300]   just to let them know that even our counselees
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.900]   who feel overwhelmed with sin and just guilt,
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.180]   and they feel weak,
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.860]   and they feel like they'll never overcome a particular sin,
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.440]   and just to let them know, to encourage them,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.760]   that your high priest does not condemn you,
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.620]   but he sympathizes with you.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:55.060]   You need to fully love this doctrine
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.140]   and then use it in counseling ministry to encourage,
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.940]   to give real encouragement to your counselees,
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.260]   because the humanity of Christ gives us hope.
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.140]   I mean, it really does.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.540]   It teaches us that Jesus Christ
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:15.380]   does not stand in heaven far off and aloof and uncaring,
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.140]   and he's just out to condemn us
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.860]   and trying to find out all the things that we do wrong,
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.260]   and he's just gonna hit us over the head
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.460]   with some kind of rod of discipline
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.020]   every time we do something wrong in life.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.400]   No, the humanity of Christ teaches us
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.620]   that we are to come boldly to the throne of grace
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.220]   and have confidence because we serve a high priest
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.500]   who knows us, who understands us,
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.120]   who sympathizes with our weaknesses,
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.660]   and who has died for us on the cross
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.100]   as our perfect substitute.
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.260]   And I just wanna encourage you
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.660]   to see the counseling implications
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.860]   of the humanity of Christ
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.140]   and use this doctrine in counseling ministry.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.240]   I need to move on to the deity of Christ.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.380]   I'm gonna do a brief overview of this.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.300]   We see that divine attributes are applied to Christ.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.460]   Attributes that can only be ascribed to divinity
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.300]   are said to be true of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.620]   These are statements that would be blasphemous
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.440]   if it were not true that Jesus is fully God.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.140]   A statement such as Matthew 28, verse 18,
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.300]   and Jesus came and said to them,
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:31.540]   "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.340]   Jesus claims that omnipotence belongs to him.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.340]   Well, that would be blasphemous if Jesus wasn't fully God.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:45.980]   He is claiming the right to a divine omnipotence.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.060]   And then John 8, verse 58,
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.740]   Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.060]   before Abraham was, I am."
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.500]   That's claiming the attribute of eternality.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.220]   And just, again, they understood what he was saying.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.500]   He was claiming to be God because it says in verse 59
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.280]   that they picked up stones to throw at him,
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.060]   but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.380]   Hebrews 13, verse 8,
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.020]   "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.760]   That's the attribute of immutability.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.460]   So you have these statements throughout the scriptures,
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.460]   divine attributes applied to Christ.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.860]   You have divine names being applied to Christ.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.940]   The name God is applied to Christ, that's pretty clear.
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.820]   In Hebrews 1, verse 8,
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.980]   "But of the son," he says, "your throne, O God,
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.140]   is forever and ever.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:38.540]   The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom."
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.020]   The term son refers to Christ.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.180]   And the writer of Hebrews says that the son
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.440]   is clearly to be referred to as God.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.860]   Not only the title God,
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.940]   but the title Lord is ascribed to Christ.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.620]   Matthew 22, verse 42,
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.060]   "What do you think about the Christ?
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.460]   Whose son is he?
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.940]   They said to him, 'The son of David.'
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.440]   He said to them, 'How is it then that David,
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.180]   in the Spirit, calls him Lord?'
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.240]   The great confession of Thomas in John 20, verse 28,
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.340]   "Thomas answered him, 'My Lord, am I God?'"
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.100]   A clear reference to Christ as God.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.420]   And then Titus 2, verse 13,
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.580]   says, "Waiting for our blessed hope,
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.940]   the appearing of the glory of our great God
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.000]   and Savior, Jesus Christ."
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.060]   We find that the title Savior is ascribed to Christ.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.340]   Luke 2, verse 11,
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.420]   "For unto you is born this day in the city of David,
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.860]   a Savior, who is Christ the Lord,
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.460]   and Jesus Christ himself claimed to be God."
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.100]   In John 5, verse 18,
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.300]   "This is why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.540]   because not only was he breaking the Sabbath,
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.600]   but he was even calling God his own father,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:54.040]   making himself equal with God."
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.860]   So they understood that Jesus was claiming
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:01.180]   the titles of deity.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.580]   And then letter C, moving quickly,
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.180]   "Divine works ascribed to Christ."
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.020]   Colossians 1, verse 16,
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.100]   "For by him that is Christ,
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.140]   all things were created in heaven and on earth,
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.880]   visible and invisible,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.160]   whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities,
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.940]   all things were created through him and for him.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.580]   And he is before all things,
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:26.620]   and in him, all things hold together."
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:31.620]   That's the wonder of who our Savior is.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.700]   At some point, you stop speculating,
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.100]   you just start worshiping.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.100]   Just look at these truths,
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.900]   and you realize that I'm never gonna figure all of this out,
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.340]   even when I'm in heaven,
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:51.220]   I'm gonna be standing in awe and wonder at who Jesus is,
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:56.220]   but you just start worshiping Jesus, the God-man.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.900]   And that leads us to letter D,
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.340]   "Divine worship ascribed to Christ."
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:06.080]   Remember, this would be blasphemous if Jesus were not God.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.480]   Matthew 28, verse 16,
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.680]   "Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee,
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.960]   to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.940]   And when they saw him, they worshiped him,
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.260]   but some doubted."
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.080]   You remember the passage in Revelation 22, verse eight,
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.720]   "I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.720]   And when I heard and saw them,
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.840]   I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:29.800]   who showed them to me.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.720]   But he said to me, 'You must not do that.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.760]   I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers,
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.600]   the prophets, and with those who keep the words
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.680]   of this book, worship God.'"
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.640]   So only God is to be worshiped.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:46.240]   And Jesus Christ receives divine worship.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.780]   That would be blasphemous if Jesus were not God.
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.120]   So you have the full humanity of Christ.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.560]   You have the full deity of Christ.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.500]   Those are the dual natures of Christ.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.480]   The third thing we need to deal with
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.420]   is an understanding of how those two natures
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.480]   are joined together.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.600]   So let me move to, I think this is on your handout
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.360]   on page five, the hypostatic union.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.480]   What does the hypostatic union mean?
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.800]   Well, simply said, the term hypostatic union
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.800]   refers to the union of two distinct natures in one person.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.680]   It's the union of the distinct nature of deity
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.360]   and the nature of full humanity in one person,
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.440]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.000]   If there is a difference between the term incarnation
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   and the term hypostatic union,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.160]   it would be that the incarnation refers to the act
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.680]   whereby the son of God took to himself
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:55.000]   an additional nature, the nature of humanity.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.320]   The hypostatic union, that term refers to the union
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.640]   that resulted through the joining
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.420]   of full humanity to full deity.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:13.280]   And so we're referring to the union of two distinct natures.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.160]   Now I have there on your handout
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.200]   some inadequate views of the hypostatic union.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.700]   I'm gonna skip some of this material.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.920]   You can read on your own, but let me move
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.160]   to some inadequate views just to let you know
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.880]   that we need to be careful on how we understand
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.240]   the hypostatic union.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.880]   The first inadequate view, and Wayne Grudem
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.700]   does a great job of walking you through this
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.200]   if you read through his systematic theology.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:47.280]   The first inadequate view would be Apollinarianism.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.840]   Apollinarianism was the view of the Bishop Apollinaris
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.320]   who lived in the fourth century AD.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:01.020]   Apollinaris sought to avoid an undue separation
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.980]   of the two natures of Christ.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.300]   And so he taught that Christ had a human body
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.500]   but not a human mind or spirit.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.340]   Jesus Christ was essentially a divine mind
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.420]   and a divine spirit in a human body.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:21.680]   That's where we get the term God in a bod,
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.100]   that idea that Jesus wasn't fully human,
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.480]   but merely he was a divine mind
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.620]   and a divine spirit in a human body.
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:36.220]   Now that does not capture, as I've shared with you,
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.280]   the full biblical understanding of who Jesus Christ is.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.240]   Apollinarianism was rejected by several church councils,
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.160]   including the Council of Constantinople in AD 381.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:54.180]   And what we learn from Apollinarianism
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.540]   and the church's response to this error
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.220]   is we have to be very careful
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.700]   to affirm the full humanity of Jesus Christ.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:09.380]   Those who hold to Apollinarianism would say that,
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.180]   yes, Jesus had a human body,
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:17.180]   but not fully a human mind or a human spirit or soul.
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.460]   And so we need to be very careful
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.060]   to affirm the full humanity of Jesus Christ.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.260]   That's indicated as well in 1 John 4, verse two,
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:30.060]   which says, "By this you know the Spirit of God.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.500]   "Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.820]   "has come in the flesh is from God,
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.180]   "and every spirit that does not confess Jesus
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:41.000]   "is not from God."
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.520]   So that's speaking of the necessity
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.380]   of affirming the full humanity of Christ.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:51.340]   A second inadequate view is the view of Nestorianism.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:56.840]   Nestorianism divided Christ into two persons
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:01.680]   and held that these two persons existed in one body.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.980]   So that is an additional error,
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.980]   an inadequate view of the hypostatic union.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.040]   It's actually disputed whether Nestorius,
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.960]   a Bishop of Constantinople in AD 428,
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.080]   actually taught that the error bore his name,
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.700]   and Nestorianism was condemned
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.820]   by the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD.
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.820]   Grudem writes this.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.280]   This isn't on your handout,
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.400]   but it was a very helpful explanation.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.720]   He writes, "Nowhere in Scripture
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.600]   "do we have an indication that the human nature of Christ
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.860]   "is an independent person,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:47.100]   "doing something contrary to the divine nature of Christ,
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.300]   "nor do we have an indication of the human
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:52.560]   "and divine natures talking to each other
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.840]   "or struggling within Christ or any such thing.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.420]   "Rather, we have a consistent picture
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:02.640]   "of a single person acting in wholeness and unity.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.420]   "Jesus always speaks as I, not we.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:11.740]   "The Bible always speaks of Jesus as he, not they.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.860]   "And though we can sometimes distinguish actions
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.000]   "of his divine nature and actions of his human nature
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.500]   "in order to help us understand
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.480]   "some of the statements and actions recorded in Scripture,
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.220]   "the Bible itself does not say
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.220]   "Jesus's human nature did this
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.180]   "or Jesus's divine nature did that
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.700]   "as though they were separate persons.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.780]   "But the Bible always talks about
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.220]   "what the person of Christ did.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.300]   "Therefore, the church continued to insist
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.580]   "that Jesus was one person,
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.800]   "although possessing both a human nature
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.060]   "and a divine nature."
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:52.300]   So a very good explanation of that idea
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.260]   that Jesus is not two persons.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:53:00.240]   He is a one person with two natures.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.300]   And then a third inadequate view would be Eutychianism.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:12.420]   This was a reaction against Nestorianism
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:17.420]   and emphasized that there was only one nature in Christ.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:24.060]   And so Eutychianism taught that the human nature of Christ
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.740]   was taken up and absorbed into the divine nature
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:30.340]   so that both natures were changed somewhat
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.680]   and a third kind of nature resulted.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   So this is the informal way of putting it.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:41.740]   Apollinarianism would be God in a bod,
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.020]   Eutychianism would be God in a blender.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:48.300]   It's this idea of you have the divine nature of Jesus
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.340]   and the human nature of Jesus,
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.660]   and they sort of mix together and blended together
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:57.700]   and formed this kind of hybrid third kind of nature.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:02.700]   And again, that is an inadequate view
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:03.860]   of the hypostatic union.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:07.440]   That is not reflective of what the Bible would teach
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.020]   of how the two natures were joined together.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:15.060]   So this is the opposite error from Nestorianism.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:19.260]   Eutychianism denied that the human nature
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.440]   and divine nature of Christ remained fully human
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.020]   and fully divine.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:27.060]   He held rather that the human nature of Christ
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:30.380]   was taken up and absorbed into the divine nature
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.440]   so that both natures were changed somewhat
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.180]   and a third kind of nature resulted.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.620]   So how do we understand the hypostatic union?
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.600]   Grudem does a great job of walking you through
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.460]   the Chalcedonian definition of 451 AD.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.300]   And there's a couple statements in that definition.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.980]   You can read the whole thing on your own.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:58.300]   But a couple key portions of that definition,
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:02.900]   which was a response to Apollinarianism, Nestorianism,
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.300]   Eutychianism, those were all things
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.220]   that were floating around in that day.
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:13.100]   And the Chalcedonian definition sought to clarify
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:16.420]   the doctrine of the hypostatic union.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.060]   And this definition said,
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.260]   our Lord Jesus Christ at once complete in Godhead
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:26.260]   and complete in manhood, truly God and truly man,
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:32.220]   consisting also of a reasonable soul and body.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:35.900]   Now, why is the statement saying that
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.580]   he is truly God and truly man?
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.800]   Well, what the statement was doing there
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   is affirming the full humanity of Jesus Christ.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:50.260]   That part of the statement was responding to the idea
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:54.060]   that Jesus Christ was merely human
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.500]   in terms of his physical body.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.460]   And so you have that language of truly God and truly man,
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.220]   complete in manhood.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:07.020]   It was an attempt to assert the full humanity
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.220]   of Jesus Christ in response to Apollinarianism.
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:13.860]   And then you have this famous statement here
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.820]   in the Chalcedonian definition,
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.340]   recognized in two natures,
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.940]   and then note those four statements that follow,
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.760]   without confusion, without change,
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:29.100]   without division, without separation.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:33.980]   Those are four very important statements
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.340]   that I'll bring up on the next slide
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:41.340]   that really clarify what we mean by the hypostatic union.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.500]   I'll just note at this point
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.340]   that there are four really important statements there,
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.100]   without confusion, without change,
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.680]   without division, without separation.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.080]   And then it goes on to say the distinction of natures
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.120]   being in no way annulled by the union,
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.540]   that's responding to Eutychianism,
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.140]   the idea that you sort of blended these natures together
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.700]   and got a third kind of nature.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.700]   The statement is saying, no, the natures are distinct,
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.880]   and distinction is in no way annulled by the union,
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.820]   but rather the characteristics of each nature
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:20.020]   being preserved and coming together to form,
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.720]   how many persons?
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.420]   One person.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:27.400]   So that's a response to Nestorianism that said,
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.500]   because you have two natures, there has to be two persons.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.860]   You find that this statement is really responding
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.700]   to all three inadequate definitions.
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.620]   So Kevin DeYoung does a great job
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.100]   walking us through those four key phrases
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.100]   without confusion.
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:46.140]   So the Lord Jesus Christ is not what you get
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.900]   when you mix blue and yellow together
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.100]   and end up with green.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:52.500]   It's a good way of talking about the whole idea of blending.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.060]   There's no confusion.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.080]   He's not a tertium quid, a third thing,
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.660]   the result of mixing a divine and human nature.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.620]   The second statement, without change,
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.780]   in assuming human flesh,
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.880]   the Logos did not cease to be what he had always been.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.620]   The incarnation affected no substantial change
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.080]   in the divine son.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.700]   The third statement, without division,
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.300]   the two natures of Christ do not represent a split
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.360]   in the divine person.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.560]   Jesus Christ is not half God and half man.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.160]   And then without separation,
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.220]   the union of the human and divine
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:29.020]   in the person of Jesus Christ is a real organic union,
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:33.820]   not simply a moral sympathy or relational partnership.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:39.840]   And so that statement is still the standard definition
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.940]   of a hypostatic union affirmed by Protestant churches today.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:46.620]   Okay, so here's the payoff.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.620]   Give me five minutes and I'll wrap this up.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:53.380]   This is the last part of the essay question.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:54.800]   The question is,
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.960]   discuss the dual natures of Christ
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:03.900]   and then talk about why this is necessary
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:05.760]   for our salvation.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   So let me just end this on a very happy note
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:15.140]   by saying it has everything to do with our salvation.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:20.140]   If Jesus Christ were not fully God and fully man,
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:22.680]   there would be no salvation.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:27.320]   He is the perfect savior because he is the perfect man,
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.380]   the second Adam.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:33.160]   He is the perfect man who obeyed when Adam disobeyed.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.600]   He triumphed where Adam fell.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.960]   He was the only man to ever fully obey
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.960]   the law of God perfectly and never fail to obey God's law.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.740]   He never sinned in attitude, in action.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:55.740]   He never sinned in sin of omission or commission.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:58.800]   He is the perfect man.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.240]   And because he is the perfect man,
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.280]   he is the perfect substitute.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.160]   The whole concept of substitutionary atonement
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.320]   that there was one who stood in our place,
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.640]   who took the place that we ought to have stood in,
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.320]   who bore the wrath we ought to bear
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.440]   and paid the payment that we ought to have paid.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.760]   That whole beautiful concept of substitution
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.120]   that was foretold in the Old Testament
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.440]   where there were lambs and bulls and the blood of goats.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.120]   And there was always this concept of someone needs to die
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.680]   for your sins in order for you to be saved.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.840]   And it all pointed forward
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.440]   to the perfect substitute who is Christ.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.480]   And because he was the perfect man,
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.480]   he was able to be the perfect substitute.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.720]   And that is just something we ought to rejoice in.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.200]   But the second part of it is
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.320]   because Jesus Christ was fully God,
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:57.680]   he could make perfect atonement for our sins.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.960]   That's why the writer of Hebrews says,
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.160]   "There's no more need for sacrifices.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.440]   "There's no more need to bring the blood of bulls and goats.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.920]   "The perfect sacrifice has been offered."
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.840]   And Jesus Christ sat down once and for all
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.240]   because he had completed the work of atonement.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.360]   Perfect atonement has been made.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.360]   The infinite value of the sacrifice of Christ at the cross
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.960]   was fully sufficient to pay for all of our sins,
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.280]   past, present and future.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.960]   And it all relates to this topic,
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.200]   the dual natures of Jesus Christ.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.520]   This is a work by Bruce Ware, "The Man, Christ, Jesus."
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.840]   I'd encourage you to pick this up
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.600]   if you have a spare $10.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.280]   It's well worth the price of admission.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.080]   He has a book called "The Man, Christ, Jesus,"
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.720]   where he reflects on the humanity of Jesus Christ.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.640]   And he says this,
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.140]   "Why couldn't a perfect second Adam have been our savior?
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:00.660]   "If God had created a perfect and sinless second Adam,
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.820]   "if God had worked in him so that he never sinned,
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.740]   "this perfect man still could not have saved us
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.180]   "by taking our sin and dying in our place."
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:11.960]   So he's saying, "If you had a perfect man,
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.420]   "but he was not also perfectly God,
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.580]   "he could not have been the perfect substitute.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.420]   "Why?
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.040]   "As a man, he would qualify to take our place in death,
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.500]   "but as only a man, he could take our sin and pay for it
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.340]   "in just the same manner we as mere humans would pay for it."
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.820]   So now the question is this,
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.660]   how do we as humans pay for our sin
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.900]   if we are required to pay for it ourselves?
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.740]   Here's the answer.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.280]   We pay for it eternally.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.240]   That is, we never finished paying for our sin
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.100]   because our sin requires an infinite payment.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.960]   The reason that hell is eternal
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.060]   is simply that justice demands a full payment for our sin,
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.740]   and a full payment is impossible for finite humans
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.020]   to render to an infinitely holy God.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.980]   Therefore, if we pay for our own sin, we pay forever,
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.220]   and hence there never comes a time
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.900]   when we can say it is finished.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.640]   It can never be said of us,
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.800]   the payment for our sin has been completed,
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.900]   and God's just demands against us are fully satisfied.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.940]   That's staggering.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.300]   I mean, 10,000 years in hell,
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.380]   if you die without Christ,
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.600]   there will never come a point in hell
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.260]   where people will say the payment is complete for my sin
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:33.980]   because sin requires an infinite payment.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:38.220]   And so the duration of the punishment is eternal.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:42.620]   And what, where it goes on to say is,
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.440]   this is the glory of our Savior.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.300]   Therefore, Jesus had to be fully God as well as fully man.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.980]   He had to be fully God for the payment he rendered
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.780]   to be of infinite value,
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.460]   satisfying fully the demands of an infinitely holy God,
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.180]   but he also had to be fully human
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:01.300]   in order for his death to be substitutionary.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.660]   He died in our place,
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.500]   dying the death that we deserve to die,
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.380]   burying in his body on the cross the sin we commit,
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.740]   the infinite value of Christ's payment for our sin
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.700]   attaches to his being fully God.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.980]   The substitutionary nature of Christ's death
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:20.980]   attaches most squarely to his being fully human.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.500]   I know it costs $10,
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.080]   but that's worth the price of admission.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.480]   I'd encourage you to get that book.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.780]   It'll help you answer the fourth part of this question.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:34.040]   Why did Jesus need to be fully God as well as fully man
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.960]   in order to bring salvation to the world?
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.500]   And where says it, I think as good as anyone could say it,
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.780]   he had to be fully human to be our substitute.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:47.780]   He had to be fully God to make perfect atonement.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:52.860]   And so Charles Ryrie concludes with this.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.420]   If because of the death of Christ, God is satisfied,
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:58.660]   then what can the sinner do to try to satisfy God?
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.760]   The answer is nothing.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.020]   Everything has been done by God himself.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.820]   I mean, that's the glory of our salvation
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:07.660]   is that Jesus has paid it all.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.680]   He says a sinner can and need only receive
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.540]   the gift of righteousness God offers.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.620]   God is appeased, placated and satisfied eternally.
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.820]   This is the message we bring to a lost world.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.020]   Receive the savior who through his death
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.100]   satisfy the wrath of God.
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:27.140]   I don't know of any sweeter sound that a sinner can hear
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:30.620]   than to know that God is satisfied
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.900]   through the death of the perfect substitute, Jesus.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.900]   And so this is what we bring to our counselees.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.360]   So I know I've gone over time,
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.960]   but let me just encourage you in this way.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.900]   This is the message we have to bring to our counselees.
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:54.300]   I mean, this is Romans 8, verse one.
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.940]   There is therefore now no condemnation
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.400]   for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.780]   Can you imagine a counselee who comes for counseling,
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:03.980]   who is so weighed down because this person's going through
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.300]   so much suffering, so many trials,
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   and this person feels like God is punishing him or her.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.680]   And he cannot see the favored smile of God.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.580]   He only sees the frowning providence of God's hand.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.440]   And it is your role as a biblical counselor
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:29.320]   to reorient your counselee to these gospel truths
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.040]   that you are not being condemned.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.320]   You are not being punished for your sins.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.160]   Jesus was punished for your sins.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.520]   The satisfaction has been complete in him
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.440]   and you are not being condemned.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.120]   Now God is using these trials to make you more like Christ.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.000]   And he's gonna give you all sufficient grace
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.840]   to help you through your trials.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.080]   But these are not, this is not punishment.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.200]   It's not condemnation.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.640]   Hebrews 10, verse 14, for by a single offering
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.040]   he has perfected for all time
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.960]   those who are being sanctified.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.080]   And Romans 5, verse one,
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.160]   therefore, since we have been justified by faith,
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.200]   we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.720]   through him, we have also obtained access by faith
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.080]   into this grace in which we stand
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.140]   and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:14.680]   I mean, that's just the truths that we need to internalize
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.600]   and learn and give to our counselees.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.600]   ACBC is the one counseling organization that I know,
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.000]   maybe there's others, but this is our distinctive
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   as ACBC is we train our counselees,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.080]   our counselors to speak about Jesus.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.000]   I mean, that's basically it.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.820]   We want our counselees to talk about Jesus and him crucified,
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.540]   the gospel of Christ, the good news of Christ.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:49.340]   And so theology exam number 12 is part of that training.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.820]   It's part of that training to produce
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.860]   Christ-centered counselors who can minister
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.060]   the truth of Christ to others.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:00.580]   And so I hope you'll do well on this essay,
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.740]   that you'll rejoice your way through it,
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.020]   and that you'll have a wonderful time this week
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:06.780]   writing this essay.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.920]   So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna close and in prayer,
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.040]   and you can be free to go tonight.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.120]   I'll hang on for a few minutes if any of you have questions
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.240]   on the essays or anything that I can help with.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.480]   But let me close in prayer and let you guys go.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:23.280]   Father, we just rejoice tonight.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.400]   Just thank you so much for Christ.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.400]   We can never thank you enough for the gospel message,
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   this glorious news of the salvation of Jesus,
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:42.100]   our perfect substitute, the one mediator between God and man,
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.540]   the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:48.940]   We just thank you that our sins have been paid for
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:52.160]   in full at the cross, that there is no condemnation
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.520]   for those of us who are in Christ Jesus.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.140]   We pray that Lord, you would allow these truths
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.800]   to bring joy to our hearts,
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.300]   and that you would help us, Lord,
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.940]   to then minister these truths to others.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:08.340]   Make us into gospel-centered, Christ-centered counselors
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.380]   who can take your word and minister hope and help
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:16.380]   to those who are so desperately in need of these truths.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.300]   And we give the fruit of this time to you,
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.140]   and we thank you for it.
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.760]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.500]   Well, friends, thanks so much for joining us tonight.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.100]   If you have any questions on anything,
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:32.100]   I'll be happy to, I will be happy to answer that on the chat.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:37.280]   Otherwise, we will see you next week at five o'clock,
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.900]   where we'll go through theology exam number 13.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:48.560]   Thanks so much, you guys, for your encouragement.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.900]   A question came in, "Could you please expound
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.780]   "on counseling issues related to grief
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:58.240]   "and diagnosis of illness?"
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.700]   Yeah, a quick response to that would just be,
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:08.760]   biblical counselors must be equipped to minister
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.880]   to those who are grieving, not only because of the need
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.160]   and the many who are grieving in the church
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.960]   and in the world, but so that we could be like Christ.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.440]   I mean, that is Jesus, the man of sorrows,
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:26.480]   Jesus who was grieved to the point of death.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.900]   Jesus understands, Jesus draws near
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.920]   to those who are grieving.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.600]   And so we must learn to be like Christ.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.560]   I think that would be as simply as I would put it.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.600]   Christ went to the grave site of Lazarus and he wept.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.280]   And he didn't try to explain all of the sorrows away.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.520]   He just wept with those who weep.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.520]   And that's something that I really want to encourage
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:59.360]   our counselors to develop is,
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.760]   you need to learn to weep with those who weep.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.280]   25 years ago, I went to seminary,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.360]   I came out with all the answers,
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.720]   and I was just a Bible machine gun.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.120]   Anyone who's struggling with anything,
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.920]   I would know the answers and just kind of shoot them
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.480]   with Bible verses.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.240]   And it was when God took me through
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.840]   my own personal wilderness and God broke me
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.740]   and humbled me and he took me through
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.720]   my own seasons of sorrow.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.680]   And now I've sat with many counselees
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.920]   and just before giving answers, I just weep with them.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.400]   I just weep with those who weep
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.000]   because that's a biblical command.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.280]   And also that's one of the most effective ways to counsel.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:46.080]   I always remember the deacon who counseled me at Kindred.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.460]   And I don't remember what he said,
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.160]   but I remember the tears in his eyes
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.800]   as he just grieved with me over certain things
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.640]   that were going on in my life.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.080]   And when you see that kind of counselor,
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.820]   I tell you, you're open to whatever
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:58.960]   that person is gonna say,
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.480]   'cause you know that person cares about you.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.320]   So learn to be compassionate,
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.560]   learn to enter a person's world,
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.080]   just learn to,
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:11.600]   it's never the,
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.200]   the goal is never to eliminate grief.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.280]   Grief will be with us, sorrow will be with us
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.200]   until we go to heaven.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.480]   The goal is to help people walk with God
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.600]   in seasons of grief,
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.300]   to know that they can draw near to Christ in their sorrow,
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.280]   that Christ understands them.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.560]   And that's for each of us.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:34.560]   It's not the elimination of emotion, that's sanctification.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.060]   It's drawing near to Christ in your sorrow.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.960]   So I just encourage you to think through that
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.780]   and to develop those truths
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:50.000]   and to learn to minister to those who are hurting.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.520]   Greg Laurie said that if you minister to hurting hearts,
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.720]   you'll always have an audience.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.920]   And that's true for counseling
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.120]   as well as it is for preaching and teaching.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.360]   So please think through that
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.000]   and develop that in your own ministry.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.200]   - Well, God bless you guys.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.600]   Thanks so much for taking the hour tonight.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.800]   And I had a lot to say.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.920]   So it went a little bit over time,
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.360]   but I just really appreciate your patience
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.200]   and your faithfulness.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.760]   We'll be back here at five o'clock next week, next Sunday,
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.080]   and we'll go through the-
