[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Well, the Cross Conference continues today in Louisville and ends tomorrow on Saturday
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.420]   and over 7,000 young men and women are registered for the conference in Kentucky, which should
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.360]   prompt all of us to pray about what God might do with how many young men and women who are
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.480]   considering giving their lives to the nations as missionaries.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.080]   But even as you travel, the questions keep arriving from listeners facing a year of Bible
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.600]   reading ahead and this email is from Jeff.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.120]   "Hi, Pastor John, through various seasons of my life, I've been ministered through the
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.120]   Bible and through other books and especially through your own books.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.480]   In 2019, how can I best balance Bible reading with reading other books specifically?
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.200]   If I have only an hour a day to read, how would you suggest I allocate my time between
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.720]   the Bible and other books?"
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.680]   That's a nice specific way to ask it, isn't it?
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.680]   Yeah, it is.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.160]   Like you got one hour, you got your Bible and you got some other books, tell me what
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160]   to do.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.160]   Wow.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.800]   That's a little bit risky to tell somebody how to apportion their time between the Bible,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.960]   the very Word of God and other books.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.120]   But I will give a very specific suggestion in just a moment.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.640]   But first, a couple of thoughts.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.440]   When I read this question, I wasn't sure what kind of books Jeff had in mind.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.080]   Is he asking about Bible reading versus reading Pilgrim's Progress, Packer's Knowing God,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.920]   Calvin's Institutes, or is he asking about reading the Bible versus reading Sports Illustrated
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.920]   or National Geographic or a novel, a manual on how to be a mechanic or science school
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   texts?
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   What is he asking?
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.320]   Well, let me say a word about Bible reading versus the quest for knowledge in general
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.440]   outside the Bible, because I can imagine a person saying, "Well, if the Bible is the
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.800]   very Word of the Creator of the universe, why would you not just stay with your Bible
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.600]   all day and listen to God, for goodness sake?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.720]   He's God."
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.560]   And the answer to that question is because the Bible tells you not to.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.960]   Go to the ant, oh sluggard, consider her ways and be wise.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.000]   In other words, close your Bible and go out and look at an anthill.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.260]   Learn something from the world.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.920]   Consider the lilies of the field.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.880]   Close your Bible and go look at some lilies.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.380]   Consider the birds of the air.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.920]   Close your Bible and go look at the birds of the air.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.840]   Don't just read the Bible, read God's world as well as God's Word.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.520]   And of course, the Bible tells us to work with our hands, to provide a living, but you
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.840]   learn how to be a tent maker like Paul, or a doctor like Luke, or a carpenter like Jesus
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.880]   Father, or a professional fisherman like Peter.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.500]   You learn how to do those skills, not by reading your Bible.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.080]   The Bible doesn't tell you which stitches hold tents together when the leather gets
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   wet.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   It doesn't do that.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   It's not designed for that.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.240]   You go out and look at the world and listen to wise people and study nature and figure
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.080]   things out.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.320]   So all that just to say that the Bible itself instructs us to learn about the world and
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.560]   learn about people and learn about vocations and learn about society and social processes
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.520]   that God made by looking at them.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.560]   We don't stop seeing the hand of God just because we're not reading the Bible.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.840]   Now that's probably not what Jeff was asking.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.320]   I just wanted to say it, right?
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   I think what Jeff is asking is if I have a good book about God and His ways to read by
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.080]   a godly author, and I have one hour and I have to divvy up reading that book from reading
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.680]   the Bible, what should my proportion be?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.320]   Like Calvin's Institute, J.I.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   Packard, "Knowing God."
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.640]   If you want to read some of that, you want to read your Bible, how do you do it?
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.040]   So here goes.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   And remember, I have no biblical authority for saying this, this proportion that I'm
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.840]   going to suggest.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.640]   I'm going to remind all of our listeners something I've said before a long time ago.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.440]   Suppose you read slowly like I do, about 200 words a minute, which may be this pace I'm
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   talking right now.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   I don't know.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.840]   If you read 15 minutes a day for one year, you'll read 5,475 minutes in a year.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.480]   Multiply that by 200 words a minute, and you get 1,095,000 words that you would have read
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.960]   in a year.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.160]   Now an average serious book might have, what, 360 words on a page.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.640]   I counted a bunch of them.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:01.400]   So you would read 3,041 pages in one year during that 15-minute slot a day.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.680]   A serious book would average maybe, what, 250 pages?
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.960]   Lots of books are just 150 pages, but let's just say a good, solid, serious theology book
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.440]   would have 250 pages.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.720]   I just flopped one open yesterday that I just got in the mail.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.080]   There it was, 250 pages.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.720]   That's 12 very substantial books all in 15 minutes a day for the average slow reader.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.440]   So I'm going to suggest to Jeff that he reads 45 minutes in the Bible slowly, thoughtfully,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.320]   meditating, praying, which would get him through the Bible in a year, and that he spend 15
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:48.480]   minutes of that hour reading a great, God-centered, Bible-saturated book that will serve his Bible
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.480]   reading.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.920]   And I'm assuming that Jeff then sets aside another chunk of time for prayer, by the way.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.600]   That's another conversation we should have.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.320]   Someone might say, "How could you even dare to suggest that any book intrude itself on
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.680]   an hour that he could spend reading the Bible?"
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:14.600]   And my answer is, my experience, and the Bible itself, tells me that other people's vision
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.920]   of what they have seen in the Bible can be a great means of seeing more in the Bible.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.520]   I know this is true.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.560]   If I take 10 minutes in the morning to read John Owen or Jonathan Edwards, I see more
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.040]   in my Bible.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:38.360]   So I think if Jeff chooses his books wisely, they will not diminish what Jeff sees in God's
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.160]   Word in that hour.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.360]   Looking through the eyes of others will increase Jeff's grasp of the greatest things in the
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.200]   world when he reads his Bible.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.200]   Amen.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.320]   This is some really wise counsel here, Pastor John.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   Thank you.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.480]   And, you know, we have surpassed now 1,300 total episodes in the life of this podcast,

[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.960]   Well there are seasons of life when we are especially weary and when it seems like we're
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.000]   simply too busy and tired for meaningful Bible reading.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.640]   In those seasons, how do we push back the fatigue and the many chores of life in order
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.920]   to engage with God's Word each day?
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.880]   That's the question from a perplexed listener who needs life advice on Monday when we return.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.920]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, your host.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   Have a great weekend.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.520]   We'll see you back here on the other side of the weekend.
