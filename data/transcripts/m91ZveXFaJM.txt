[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.280]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the 7th chapter and again I must read the first 8 verses, the first 8 verses in the 7th chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:40.560]   Then said the high priest, Are these things so? And he, Stephen, answered and said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charon, and said unto him,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:58.800]   Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee. Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charon. And from this, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:11.920]   And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. Yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:29.600]   And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a land, in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. And the nation to whom thou, they shall be in bondage, will I judge, said God.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:45.840]   And after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day. And Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:58.320]   Now, here we are dealing, you see, with the great address, the great sermon, if you like, that was delivered by the first Christian martyr, whose name was Stephen.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:09.120]   The previous chapter tells us how this man had been arrested, and had been arraigned before this great council of judgment in Jerusalem, which is called the Sanhedrin.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:22.960]   He'd been arrested because he was not only a Christian, but he was a preacher. He was a man who was filled with the spirit. He was able to expound the gospel, teach the people. He was able to work miracles.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:37.200]   And the result of this was that he aroused the jealousy of these religious and civic authorities in Jerusalem. And here he stands on trial. They're charging him with blasphemy.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:51.600]   They say that he's speaking against the temple, that he's speaking against the law of Moses. And above all, they charge him with preaching this Jesus of Nazareth, whom they regarded also as a blasphemer.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:04.640]   Now, these are the charges that were brought against him. And as you notice, the high priest says to him, "Are these things so?" And then Stephen begins to speak.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:19.760]   And I've read to you the first portion of his address. Now, we've been looking at this on previous Sunday evenings. If I remember rightly, this must be the fifth Sunday evening that we've been looking at this beginning of Stephen's great speech.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:31.840]   It's, of course, of crucial importance. It is the first account we have, extended account at Interet, of a sermon as preached by a leading member of the early church.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:40.720]   So we have here what we may describe as authentic Christianity, and that is why I'm calling your attention to it.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.640]   We are doing this not because we are moved or animated by some kind of antiquarian, or his merely historical spirit of inquiry.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.840]   My dear friends, the times, the days in which we are living are much too urgent for that.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:04.000]   We are here, I take it, all of us, because we are in the midst of the battle of life, because we are aware of things within ourselves, our own failures and troubles.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:15.360]   We see the whole state of the world, the collapse of everything. I mean, the uselessness of trusting merely to political or social expedience, or even to education and philosophy.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:26.880]   The state of the world is displaying the bankruptcy of all human agencies, and we are here, I take it, because we have a feeling within us that perhaps it is, after all,
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:36.480]   the message of the Christian faith that can say something to us that will not only relieve us and help us, but deliver us out of our fears and forebodings,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:45.600]   and out of our failures and calamities. That's why we are doing it. So you see, the problem becomes this. What is Christianity?
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.200]   And unfortunately, there is great confusion concerning that at the present time.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.840]   Now, it's not surprising that there is confusion in the minds of those who don't claim to be Christian. One couldn't expect anything else from such.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.760]   But what makes it tragic is that there is confusion inside the Christian Church, and there are contradicting vices.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:20.480]   And so it becomes doubly important for us to know what exactly this message is. And here there is only one honest thing to do, and that is to go back to its origin, go back to its beginning.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.880]   It isn't what a modern man thinks about Christianity that matters. One man's opinion is as good as another.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.200]   If we really want to know what this is, well, let's go back to the source. Let's go back to the fountain.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:42.720]   There was a time when there wasn't such a thing as the Christian Church in this world. How did it come into being? What did it say? What did it teach? What did it do?
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:51.680]   Now, my reason for taking you back, therefore, to this is that here we rarely do go back and discover authentic Christianity.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.280]   And we have no right to regard anything that contradicts this in any way as being worthy of the name Christian.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.960]   And here, then, we are analyzing this great statement made by Stephen. And what we've seen is this.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.920]   But he does something that most of us would never have expected him to do. He gives a great lecture on history.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.360]   Here, yes, he starts off at once. The God of glory appeared to our Father Abraham. Takes them right back to their own history.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:28.080]   And begins to talk to them about that. We've considered that and have expressed our amazement at it, but we've also seen the importance of that.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.200]   We have seen that the greatest mistake of all is just to come to the New Testament and pick out certain statements.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.480]   You've got to take the whole story—Old Testament as well as New—if you really want to understand what this is about.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:52.160]   Now, Stephen starts with this word, "Hearken, men, brethren, and fathers. Hearken. Listen," he says.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.800]   And I've got to repeat that. In other words, this is a proclamation. This is an announcement.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.880]   If you want to be helped by this message, you've got to submit yourself to it.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.280]   If you come standing on your feet, as it were, confident in your own reason and understanding and your own opinions,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.440]   well, you'll go out exactly as you came in. Perhaps even worse.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.480]   If you want to know the benefits of the Christian salvation, hearken, listen, humble yourself.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:28.240]   As Christ put it, "Become as a little child. Acknowledge that you don't know, you don't understand. Listen."
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.920]   And here, you are given this great statement, and it is to this effect.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:42.320]   "God, the God of glory, and man, the world, Abraham in Mesopotamia, a pagan."
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.560]   There's the great problem. The world in its need, in its failure, and the God of glory.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.760]   And this great message is about what that God of glory has done with respect to this world and its peoples,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.040]   in its sin, its rebellion, and its failure.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.400]   And this is the whole glory of the gospel. The initiative comes from God.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:11.120]   The God of glory appeared unto Abraham. Abraham wasn't the philosopher trying to find God.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.320]   No, no, the exact opposite. God appeared, and he's gone on appearing.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.640]   It is a message of what God has done. And we were seeing last Sunday night
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:29.680]   that God has made what is called here a covenant with men. This covenant of salvation, this covenant of redemption.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.040]   This is the big thing we've seen. It comes out in the story of Abraham.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.200]   God appeared to him. God spoke to him. And this salvation is something which is supernatural.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:49.440]   It's miraculous. It starts, you see, by telling us how Abraham, at the age of 99, and Sarah, his wife, over 90,
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.360]   had a child whose name was Isaac. Oh, that's a miracle. But that's essentially the gospel.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:01.040]   It's something that staggers us, baffles us, seems ridiculous to our modern sophistication,
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.160]   to our modern scientific attitude, so-called. But this is the gospel.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.680]   If you don't come in here with the realization that you're going to hear something
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.440]   which is entirely different from everything you've ever heard anywhere else,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.800]   you haven't understood the first beginnings of Christianity.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:23.280]   This is a message that has always shocked the wise and prudent. Our Lord himself said that.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:29.120]   You remember his prayer one afternoon? "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.920]   even so foul, for so it seemed good in thy sight."
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.040]   This message has always been folly to the Greeks. Rubbish. Foolishness.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.640]   There's nothing new about this modern rejection of the gospel in terms of human wisdom.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.520]   It's as old as Christianity itself. Very well, all of that we've seen at once.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.640]   God appears, and Abram doesn't understand. Sarah still does. But God goes on with his work.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.960]   What's he doing? Well, he's producing a people, a people for himself.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.680]   He created out of this man Abram and his wife a nation, a people for his own peculiar position.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.000]   And it is through these, and what he does with them and through them,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.280]   that God is going to save mankind, and ultimately save the whole cosmos.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.400]   This old world of ours was never meant to be as it is tonight.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.280]   And here is the glory of this gospel message. It's not going to remain like this.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.600]   God is going to get a victory. God has got a plan and a purpose.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.160]   This covenant that he's made, he's going to come back in the person of his Son,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.360]   and destroy all his enemies. There's going to be a grand renovation of the whole universe.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.440]   The cosmos is going to be redeemed. And it's all going to be the result of God's action.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.400]   Well now, what we've got in the Bible is the account of all this.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.040]   So, Stephen very rightly takes them back to the beginning of the nation,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.440]   to Abram, their father, and explains their own history to them.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.280]   For these people had become so blinded in their conceit,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.520]   that they didn't even understand their own history.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.480]   They bursted of it, but they misunderstood it completely.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.400]   They'd misunderstood their own history.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.040]   They'd misunderstood the meaning of the temple and of worship.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.120]   They'd misunderstood the law of Moses.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.640]   The things they bursted of, they'd completely misunderstood.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.640]   And Stephen puts them right on their own story, their own record.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.880]   So he takes them through it. And I've got to do the same thing.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.520]   I'm not here to give my own opinions, my own ideas.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.120]   I'm just here to expound the words of the scripture that are here open before me.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.480]   And as I've already pointed out, I must repeat tonight.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.480]   It doesn't come to us as we think it does, and as we think it should.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.720]   But it comes in its own way.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.240]   And you've got to take Old Testament as well as New.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.760]   You've got to take it in the way that Stephen put it to these members of the Sanhedrin of old.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.880]   Very well. We've arrived at this point.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.840]   God has got this great plan.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.440]   And it's a plan we've seen that comes to a focus,
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.400]   to a point in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.240]   Now, Stephen, as I say, is in trouble and he's on trial
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.440]   because of his adherence to this Jesus and his teaching.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.880]   We have heard him say, say these false witnesses,
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.480]   that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.840]   and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.800]   Now, here is the center of it all.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.280]   Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.120]   The focal point of God's great eternal plan,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.560]   which he formulated before the very foundation of the world,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.960]   as we are told in many places,
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.280]   began to carry it out in the Old Testament.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.840]   Here's the preparation and it comes to the point in Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.960]   When the fullness of the times was come,
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.360]   God sent forth his Son,
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.840]   made of a woman, made under the law,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.440]   to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.240]   Very well.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.880]   Now, here is the question therefore with which we start this evening.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.720]   How is this plan to be worked out?
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.520]   What does it involve?
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.080]   What does it necessitate?
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.440]   And here again we come to a point that is not only vital,
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.320]   but a point, alas, which is greatly misunderstood at the present time.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.920]   That's why I've got to deal with it,
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.280]   and deal with it in this particular way and manner.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.760]   Now, people seem to think today that the problem of God in this world
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.840]   is a very simple problem.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.600]   Actually, there's no difficulty.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.360]   They say if God is love, well, there's no problem.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.720]   God in his love, and God as a God of love,
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.200]   has simply got to forgive us all.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.760]   And of course, as a God of love, he does so.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.000]   So the teaching is, you see, God is love.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.600]   Everything's all right.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.240]   Whether you believe in him or not, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.720]   So there are ecclesiastics who look forward, they say,
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.360]   with avidity to meeting atheists in heaven,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.240]   and things like that.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.080]   Doesn't matter whether you believe or not.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.040]   God loves you all.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.000]   You're all going to heaven.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.720]   Doesn't matter what you do, whether you live a good or a bad life.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.440]   It's irrelevant.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.160]   Doesn't matter.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.720]   The love of God solves all problems.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.320]   There's no difficulty.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.880]   They say there's no need for all your theology,
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.200]   and all your doctrines, and your dogmas.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.360]   No need for your Old Testament.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.240]   The love of God, that's the only thing that matters.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.240]   That's the only thing that counts.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.720]   Now, that, as you are aware, is the common and the popular teaching
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.680]   at the present time.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:47.040]   But you see, if you take your account of Christianity from Stephen,
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.120]   and from these early apostles, you just can't accept it.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.680]   Stephen didn't just get up and say, "It's all right, God's love.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.160]   Even you who are persecuting me, you're going to be forgiven.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.720]   It's all right.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.440]   God is love.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.800]   No more problems."
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.080]   He doesn't do that.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.640]   Back he goes to the Old Testament, and as I've shown you for about 50 verses,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.360]   he just retraces, recapitulates, goes over that Old Testament history.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.440]   And the modern man feels like asking, "Why is he wasting his time?
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.920]   I'm not interested in your Abrams, and Isaacs, and Jacobs,
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.160]   and all the Old Testament story.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.960]   It's irrelevant.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.400]   I've got nothing to do with that.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.240]   All I want to know is, does God love me?
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.200]   Will God bless me?"
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.800]   I know, my friend.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.480]   Very nice, very easy, isn't it?
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.320]   But you see, I'm here with an Old Testament and a New Testament in front of me.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.320]   And I want to show you the error of this fallacious modern attitude,
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.640]   that there's no problem, there's no difficulty.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.440]   But let me show you the answer in this way.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.600]   If it is as simple as all that, well, then I simply ask this question.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.480]   Why is it that we are given all this which we are given in the Old Testament?
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.920]   And why does Stephen go through it all?
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.440]   Why are we given the history of this man Abraham,
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.400]   and all that happened to him, and all the others, the fathers, the patriots?
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.240]   Why all that history of the children of Israel, the Jews,
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.160]   their births, marriages, deaths, wars, and all the rest of it?
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.760]   Is there any point or purpose in it?
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.080]   Or might we as well throw it away?
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.400]   What's the point of all this?
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   And then all that you read about the building of a tabernacle for worship,
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.480]   and then a temple, and all the details about the furnishings,
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.120]   and all the ceremonial and the ritual,
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.040]   and how they had to sacrifice animals, and offer the blood.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.000]   What's it all about?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.120]   Is there any meaning?
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.360]   Or is it all a complete irrelevance, something we ought to dismiss,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.800]   something we ought to reject out of hand once and forever?
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.160]   Now, I say if the modern view is right, all of this is completely unnecessary.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.880]   But I've got a still more serious and important question to put to you.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.720]   If you say that there is no problem at all
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:08.240]   in the relationship between God and this world to which you and I belong,
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.280]   well then, answer me this question.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.760]   Why was it ever necessary for the Son of God to come into this world?
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.880]   If God can easily forgive sins because he's loved,
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.840]   and if all that is necessary is that he says, "I've done it,
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.240]   whether you know it or not, or believe it or not, I've done it."
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.480]   If that is all, well then, why all that we have by way of history
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.560]   in the New Testament as well?
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:41.760]   If there is no problem, why did the Son of God ever come into this world?
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.280]   Why do we read all we read of in the pages of the four Gospels?
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:51.760]   But above all, why that death on the cross on Calvary as hell?
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.720]   Yes, you've got to face this question.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:01.360]   Our Lord, we are told, set his face deliberately, steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.120]   He was warned not to go.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.880]   They told him, "Herod's plotting to kill you. Don't go," they said.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.400]   They pleaded. He said, "I must go."
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.080]   He set his face steadfastly. He went deliberately.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.240]   He knew what was coming.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.520]   Why? If there is no problem, if the love of God is a kind of universal solvent,
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.720]   I ask not only why did the incarnation take place,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.360]   but still more, why the death on the cross on Calvary as hell?
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.000]   Now, here is the great problem.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.960]   The very learned men in the church, back away in the Middle Ages,
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.200]   perhaps towards the end of what we call the Middle Ages,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.960]   he wrote a great book bearing this title, "Cur Deus Homo."
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.680]   Why God-man?
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.880]   And that's the great central question.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.280]   Why this God-man?
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.640]   What is the truth about this Jesus?
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.360]   That's what Stephen is really dealing with.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.480]   So you see, the problem is not as simple as people seem to think it is.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.240]   And the only way whereby you can answer these fundamental questions
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.040]   about the coming of the Son of God, about his death on the cross,
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.680]   the only way to answer them satisfactorily
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.160]   is to do precisely what Stephen did, to go back and read your Old Testament.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.480]   Why do people not believe the New Testament message?
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.360]   I maintain that the chief answer is this.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.120]   They have never understood the message of the Old Testament.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.640]   There are people in the modern world standing and saying to people,
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.760]   "Come to Jesus."
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.360]   But the people don't come.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:37.860]   Why not?
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.160]   There's only one answer.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.520]   They've never seen the need of him.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.920]   No man ever becomes a Christian unless he's, first of all,
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.440]   been made aware of a need, of a lack, of trouble.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.200]   While everything's going well, while you're young and ill and hearty,
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   and you've got plenty of money in your pockets,
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.800]   you don't need Jesus Christ.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.560]   Never have it so good.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   Everything in the garden is lovely.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.840]   Isn't life wonderful?
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.880]   But you know, when you have to live with your own failures and your own soul,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   and realize you've got a running sore in your soul,
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.480]   when you realize you're a miserable failure and a wretch,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   when you see the state of your society and your world,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.280]   and you realize that there's something tragically wrong,
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.560]   then, and then only, do you begin to listen.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.040]   Well, no, the whole purpose of the Old Testament
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.920]   is to show us the need of the Lord Jesus Christ and his coming.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.720]   That's what it is.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.600]   It's the preparation for him.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.120]   Stephen, you see, is right.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.560]   He says it doesn't start here.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.400]   Don't start with Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   Go back, go back to Abraham.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.720]   Go back to the beginning of your own story.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.880]   You'll never understand Jesus, he says,
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.920]   until you've got the whole background of your history
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.840]   right in your mind and in your thinking.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.560]   Then you'll see where he fits in, and only then.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.120]   And it's still the same tonight.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.600]   No man can really preach the New Testament truly,
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.040]   except on the background of the Old Testament.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.320]   The Old Testament shows the need of the New Testament.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.640]   The New Testament is the fulfillment of the promises of the Old Testament.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.720]   It is God's great purpose of salvation.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.120]   Starting a way back before time,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.880]   working its way out until in the fullness of the times,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.640]   God sent forth his Son made of a woman made under the law.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.360]   Well now, what we are told in our text, you see, is this.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:43.760]   That God revealed the very essence of this great plan and purpose to this man Abraham.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.120]   The God of glory appeared to Abraham while he was yet in Mesopotamia.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:54.880]   He said to him, "Come out, I'm going to do something in you and through you."
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.640]   He didn't understand, of course he didn't.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.360]   But he went out not knowing whether he went.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.480]   And God began to reveal to him this great and wonderful purpose.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.920]   It comes up particularly in the story concerning his son Isaac.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.000]   But the thing is that God revealed the essence of this plan
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.320]   to this man Abraham.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.640]   And what is the problem?
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.960]   Well, I say the problem is still this.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.160]   The God of glory and this evil sinful world.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.000]   How can this world be reconciled to God?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.880]   That's the problem.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.720]   Man can't deal with it.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.960]   How does God deal with it?
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.840]   This is the question.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.400]   How can a God of glory, a God of holiness,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.240]   possibly have any dealings with sinful vile creatures?
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.080]   Now there's the problem.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.040]   And what is this problem?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.160]   Well, it's set out to us like this in the Old Testament.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.720]   And it's in the Old Testament you get the setting.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.320]   It's in the Old Testament you get the delineation of the problem.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.200]   There they are, you see, in spite of all that God does for them, failures.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.960]   You read your secular history.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.880]   You read about the great civilizations that arose and collapsed.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.600]   You read about all the learning of Greece.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.760]   And yet the verdict on it all is this.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.480]   The world, by wisdom, knew not God.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:24.240]   God gave the world a great chance with its own ability and wisdom and understanding
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.880]   to find the way and the way of salvation.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.400]   But it failed completely.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.920]   And it was then that God sent his Son into the world.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.480]   But you see, you only see the meaning of this
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.880]   when you realize the character of the problem.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.320]   What is the character of the problem?
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.120]   Well, here it is.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.240]   The problem is on the side of God.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.840]   I say this with great reverence.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.800]   Man's sin has constituted a problem for God.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.520]   Why?
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.400]   Well, because of the nature and the character of God.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.600]   You see, we tend to make God in our own image.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.760]   We think of God as of the modern indulgent father, don't we?
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.360]   The modern indulgent father doesn't believe in discipline.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.000]   Hence, the state of society.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.800]   He doesn't discipline himself in the home, and he objects if the schoolteachers discipline.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.040]   And so you get your modern moral problems, and so on, delinquency, and so forth.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.600]   But you see, the modern man thinks that God is like himself,
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.520]   like the modern indulgent father.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.680]   But my dear friends, God isn't like that.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.960]   He's the God of glory, the nature and the character of God.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.760]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.720]   You and I can't conceive of that, can we?
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.040]   No, no, but that doesn't matter.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.400]   That is God.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.200]   He's revealed himself, and has revealed himself as a holy God.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.600]   He is of such a pure countenance that he cannot even look upon sin.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.080]   He's a God of justice.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.840]   He's a God of righteousness.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   He's a God of truth.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.240]   He's the eternal antithesis to most of what we know,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:19.120]   the opposite of everything twisted, perverted, mean, small, selfish.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.280]   Oh, our trouble is we know nothing about God.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.760]   But God has been revealing himself.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.400]   That's the story of the Old Testament.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.160]   It began in this very special way with this man Abram,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.560]   whom he called out of Ur of the Chaldees.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.600]   And God began to give this revelation,
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.680]   and it runs through the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.160]   And it's this, that he is a God who hates sin.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.680]   God hates sin.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.880]   His wrath is upon it.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.040]   Now, this is the very essence of this message.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.640]   This is the great burden of the Old Testament message,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.520]   that this holy God has an eternal hatred of sin,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.040]   and is determined to punish it, and is going to punish it.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:15.760]   His wrath is upon all evil and sin and wrongdoing.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.760]   Now, we come here, of course, to the very crux of the whole matter.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.080]   When I say a thing like that,
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.680]   I know that I'm saying something that is not only objected to by the modern man,
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.600]   it is something that he abominates.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.240]   He ridicules it.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.840]   He detests the very idea.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.760]   And he does so again, of course, in terms of God's love.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.120]   You're familiar with the modern practice of pitting the New Testament against the Old Testament.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.960]   They say, "This God of wrath, this God of judgment of yours,
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.560]   this God who has a hatred of sin and who's going to punish sinners."
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.560]   They say, "That's not the God of Jesus, that's the God of Mount Sinai,
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.240]   the God of the Old Testament."
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.360]   You've heard it, haven't you?
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.760]   It's very popular in the Christian church today.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.880]   This is it, you see.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.600]   Love of God.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.800]   God loves everybody.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.840]   Don't speak of wrath.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.440]   Don't speak of punishment.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.200]   Don't speak of retribution.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.400]   The modern man hates it.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.800]   Indeed, there are many who go so far as to say this,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:17.200]   that a man like myself, who is content to preach the word of God as it's opened before us,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.080]   and who talks, therefore, about the wrath of God
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.240]   against all sin and godliness and unrighteousness,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.600]   they go so far as to say that I'm not a Christian.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.960]   The Christian spirit, they say, is one of love.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.360]   And the idea that God could ever punish anybody, that God has wrath in his being,
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.040]   it's a contradiction in terms.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.880]   They say, "You can't have wrath and love in the same person at the same time.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.640]   This is an utter impossibility."
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.640]   So they shed the whole of the Old Testament,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.280]   and they say they believe only in the God of Jesus, this God of love.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.240]   Now, this is a very serious matter.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.600]   The question for you, my dear friends, is this.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.960]   Do you believe this modern teaching, or do you believe the first martyr Stephen?
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.760]   Stephen takes you back to the Old Testament.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.400]   Now, this is a very crucial matter.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:13.520]   Do you find satisfaction in a God who has no justice and no righteousness,
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.440]   no indignation against sin, no wrath upon sin?
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.200]   He's not the God of the Bible.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.000]   But let me show you.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.080]   Let me show you the utter wrongness of this teaching,
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.680]   the danger of this teaching.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Our Lord himself accepted in its entirety the teaching of the Old Testament.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   He constantly quoted it.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.720]   He was well-versed in it.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.800]   He had it as it were at his fingertips.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.880]   He always had the appropriate word to quote to substantiate what he was saying.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:48.000]   Not only that, he said that he had come to fulfill the Old Testament.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.120]   He said he hadn't come to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.680]   And he says that heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   And he says that the universe will last until every jot and tittle.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.520]   And that means every minutest detail of the Old Testament
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.240]   has been literally fulfilled and carried out.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.960]   So you see, if you are going to reject the Old Testament and its teaching,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.200]   you are really not merely rejecting the Old Testament.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.720]   You are rejecting Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.360]   Jesus of Nazareth, the one they pit against the God of the Old Testament.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.720]   But he believed in the God of the Old Testament.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.000]   He worshipped him.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.760]   He showed that he was the same God as his God and Father.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.800]   He accepts the whole of the Old Testament teaching in its entirety.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.360]   So it's a very serious thing to reject the Old Testament.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.520]   You are incidentally at the same time rejecting the teaching
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.960]   and the message of the Son of God.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.000]   And what is this Old Testament teaching which he believed?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.240]   Well, it is great teaching with regard to the being and the character of God.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.680]   It's revealed in the Old Testament in the teaching.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.440]   You get it in the law.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.120]   "I, the Lord thy God, am holy. Be ye holy, for I am holy."
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.440]   Read your Ten Commandments.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.960]   Great exposition of the holiness of God, the eternal God.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.840]   You get the same thing in the teaching of the prophets.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.960]   That was their great message to the children of Israel.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.720]   They said, "You say you believe in God.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.040]   This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.760]   These people said, "We are God's people. We believe in God."
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.080]   But they lived in sin. They lived in vice.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.000]   They made idols for themselves.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.400]   And the prophets came to them and said, "You can't do that.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.080]   God seeth all. God knows all. Nothing is hid from God.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.720]   Your God is a God of your own imaginations.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.000]   The God of heaven is a holy God, and his wrath is upon sin."
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.520]   They called for repentance because of the nature of God.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.160]   And we've got the very word "judge" in our text this evening.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.600]   "God spake unto this wise, that Abraham's seed should sojourn in a strange land,
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.480]   and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil for four hundred years.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.520]   And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge," said God.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.720]   "I will judge," and he did.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.520]   So, you see, the teaching of the whole testament is full of this notion
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.360]   of God's indignation against sin and God's punishment of sin.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:35.280]   It's not only in teaching. It's demonstrated in action, in history.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.760]   You get it right back at the beginning.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.440]   The moment men fell, there he is, cowering in shame behind the trees in the garden,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.320]   and God comes down and speaks to them.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.040]   What does he tell them? He pronounces judgment.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.480]   And he not only pronounced it, he carried it out.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.480]   He turned them out of the garden, turned out of paradise.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.720]   Man isn't at home, you know, as we know him and as we see him in this world.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.200]   Man was never meant for the kind of life you and I have known and still know.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:10.480]   Man was meant for a life of peace and bliss and enjoyment of God in paradise.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.720]   But because he rebelled and sinned, the punishment of God came down upon him.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.960]   He was turned out, turned out of the garden, turned out of paradise.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.120]   And there is the cherubim and the flaming sword preventing his re-entry.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.320]   Man wants to get back and get the benefits without admitting his rebellion against God.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.640]   But he can't. There's a prohibition.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.720]   He's held out. It's a part of his punishment.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.120]   There it begins. Then the story of the flood.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.360]   What's that? That's judgment.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.400]   It's all right. You laugh at the flood.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.520]   Peter deals with that, doesn't he, in his second epistle in the third chapter.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.680]   He said there were scoffers in the ancient times,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.280]   and there are still scoffers who say, "Where is the promise of his coming?"
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.120]   People scoffed in the time of Noah.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.440]   They thought this man was a lunatic building an ark.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   Flood. Judgment. Destruction. Nonsense.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.800]   They took no notice of him. They said, "This fellow is beside himself.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.080]   Our Lord puts it like this."
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.040]   You remember, he summarizes the whole history in these words.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.280]   He says, "As they were in the days of Noah,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.880]   marrying and giving in marriage, buying and selling, planting and sowing,
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.760]   and knew not until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.760]   Even so, says Jesus Christ, it shall be in the last times.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.920]   They shall be marrying and giving in marriage, having a good time,
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.600]   not believing this, rejecting it all. Doesn't make any difference.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:44.080]   God's word is carried out. The judgment of the flood.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.280]   And then you go on, and you see the judgment of this nation of Egypt, you see,
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.880]   that was treating the children of Israel, the descendants of Abraham,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.280]   as captives and treating them as slaves.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.240]   Oh, God judged the nation of Egypt, and he brought out his own people.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.280]   They were overwhelmed by judgments and calamity.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.800]   God's people were brought out.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.000]   Oh, and you've got these endless stories, Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   That's history.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.280]   The cities of the plain, not only living for wealth and luxury,
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.760]   but not only living in immorality, living in vice, perversions,
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   Sodom, and all it conveys.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:29.600]   The cities of the plain were destroyed. That's an act of judgment.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.080]   God hates sin. God abominates sin, and he's going to punish sin.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.040]   Now, the Old Testament is full not only of teaching about God's indignation against sin,
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:45.120]   it is full of illustrations and examples of how God does what he says he's going to do.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.400]   He cannot abominate it. It will be punished.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.800]   Teaching and action, but especially.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.240]   The Old Testament has this teaching, to which I refer just now,
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:02.160]   about the worship of God in the temple, in the tabernacle, in the temple.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.320]   God called Moses up into a mountain,
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.800]   and he gave him detailed instructions as to how he was to be worshipped.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.640]   And this was the great point, the essence,
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:16.640]   that they were to take animals, they were to take lambs,
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:22.000]   and offer a lamb morning and evening, day by day, as an offering to God.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.800]   They were to take bulls, and the high priest was to put his hands on the head of the bull.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.360]   What for? Well, metaphorically, he's transferring the sins of the people to this animal.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.840]   Then they kill the animal and collect his blood,
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.480]   and they take that in and offer it to God,
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.760]   in the innermost sanctum, in the tabernacle, and in the temple.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.480]   Or, that you read in the book of Leviticus and other places,
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.880]   about burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and libations,
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.920]   and meal offerings, and meat offerings, and thanksgiving offerings, and so on.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   Now, I'm simply asking you a question.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.440]   Is that all a lot of nonsense that has got nothing to say to us?
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.360]   Or is it something that is of vital importance to us?
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.240]   According to Stephen, it is of vital importance, and we must understand it.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.520]   It's a part of what God spake to Abram, and what he carried out as the result of that.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.800]   Now, what does all this mean?
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.320]   Well, it's summed up like this.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:24.080]   "Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin."
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.960]   I'm not asking you to understand this.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.480]   I don't understand it myself.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:33.280]   All I know is this, that its meaning can be put in these terms.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:43.040]   That this God of glory is offended by our rebellion, and our sin against him,
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.520]   at our flouting of his commandments,
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.080]   at our supposed wisdom and cleverness,
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.840]   which leads us to think that we can run this world better than he can.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.440]   He is offended.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.160]   He is hurt.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.680]   He hates it.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.760]   And he is determined to punish it.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.800]   I will go further.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:07.920]   The very nature and character of God makes this an absolute necessity.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.800]   If God could pretend he hadn't seen it, he would no longer be God.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.920]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.960]   God can't pretend.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.320]   He can't play fast and loose.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.440]   You and I do that, and we think God does, but God cannot.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.120]   God's own holy nature makes the thing an impossibility.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.360]   As Paul argues in 2 Corinthians 6,
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.120]   "Is there any communion between light and darkness?"
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.000]   Of course there isn't.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.120]   It's impossible.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.760]   You can't mix light and darkness, black and white.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.680]   These things are eternal opposites.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.880]   There is no mean between two opposites.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.400]   And the point, therefore, of the sacrificial teaching of the Old Testament is just to tell us this.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.400]   Sin must be expiated.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.040]   God can't pretend that I haven't sinned.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.320]   I have sinned.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.400]   There are stains on my soul.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.440]   The record is there.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.600]   The blots are in the copybook of my life.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.000]   And they can't remain there to all eternity if I'm to dwell with God.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.920]   My sin must be expunded.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.280]   It must be expiated.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.760]   And the glory and the honor of an offended God must be put right.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.800]   There are two terms to cover this.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.440]   Expiation, propitiation.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.920]   And that is the meaning of the teaching of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:28.480]   They took the animal, you see, and they laid their hands on him.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.520]   They transferred the sins.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.080]   He's killed.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.440]   The blood is taken.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.200]   And it's offered to God.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.240]   Propitiation.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.400]   And God accepts it.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   And the sins of the people were covered for the time being.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.400]   Now that is the Old Testament teaching.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.560]   There, you see, they did it by substituting animals for men.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.760]   Transferring the sins of men to the animals.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.520]   And there the blood of the animals, the blood of bulls and of goats,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.360]   were offered to God in the way that is described in the Old Testament.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.120]   And that was recorded there in the ninth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.880]   that I wrote to you at the beginning.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.960]   And Abraham himself did this sort of thing.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.320]   He built altars.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.440]   He would kill animals.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.880]   He'd offer them to God.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.200]   Read the story of Abraham.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.280]   Stephen is inviting you to do so.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.360]   But the question is, why did he do all this?
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.440]   What's the meaning of all this?
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.120]   And here's the answer.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.560]   All that you've got in the Old Testament is prophetic.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.400]   It's simply pointing forward to something.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:32.080]   God is saying, now I want to put to you in a material way, a spiritual principle.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.040]   He was preparing them for something that was to come.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:40.240]   As Paul puts it, the law was our schoolmaster to lead us to Christ.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.320]   God never gave the law to the children of Israel in order to save them.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.720]   No man could keep the law.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.080]   He gave them the law to show them their need of Christ.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.600]   To show them their failure.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.200]   He's pinpointing sin.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.440]   He's showing the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.120]   The law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.600]   So are all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.320]   All the lambs, all the blood of bulls and of goats.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.520]   These are prophetic.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.800]   They're pointing forward.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:13.280]   And so Jesus of Nazareth himself uttered these words.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:18.560]   The law and the prophets were until John.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.840]   John the Baptist.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:26.640]   Since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.480]   Now here is the way in which the New Testament sums up the teaching of the Old Testament.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:41.920]   The blood of bulls and of goats cannot cleanse the conscience from sin.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.880]   Now that's the essence of this great teaching which you find in the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.360]   Here it is for you in the 10th chapter.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:57.120]   He says it is impossible that the blood of the bulls and of the goats could ever do this for us.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:02.720]   It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.440]   What did they do then?
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.680]   Well they covered them for the time being.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.600]   But they pointed forward to an act that God was going to take
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:18.160]   which really would deal with the problems of our sins and our alienation from God.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.960]   All your Old Testament is but a picture then
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.720]   of what is going to happen in the fullness of time.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.760]   What is that?
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.360]   Well in a very wonderful way.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.200]   You see it all in the case of this man Abraham.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.080]   And that is why of course Stephen so rightly starts with him.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.480]   You remember that old story that I read to you at the beginning
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.440]   from the 22nd chapter of the book of Genesis?
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.120]   God tests Abraham.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:53.360]   He went to him one day and said, "Abraham, I want you to offer your son Isaac to me."
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   You remember the story about Isaac, don't you?
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.760]   Their son that was born to Abraham when he was 99 and Sarah over 90.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.480]   The only begotten son.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.000]   They'd never had another.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.560]   And they'd waited through the years and were disappointed.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.520]   But God miraculously gives them a son.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   The only begotten son, Isaac.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:17.120]   But God says to him, "I want you to sacrifice your son Isaac."
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.800]   And Abraham made the preparations.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.680]   You see them walking along, don't you?
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.000]   The father and the son and the servants behind.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.920]   They've got the wood and they've got the fire and he's got the knife.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.280]   They've got the ropes.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.720]   Everything is ready.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.160]   And Isaac suddenly asks his question.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.720]   He awakens to the realization there's something missing.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.520]   He said, "You've got the wood.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.720]   You've got the knife.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.840]   You've got the fire.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.320]   You've got everything that's necessary for a sacrifice.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.400]   But you haven't got a lamb.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.040]   You haven't got a lamb to offer.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.320]   What about it?
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.520]   What about this omission?
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.960]   I don't understand this."
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.800]   And you remember Abraham's answer.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.000]   God will provide a lamb.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.920]   God will provide a lamb.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.960]   That's history.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.240]   Yes, but it's not only history.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.120]   It's prophecy.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.160]   It's teaching.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:14.000]   Don't you remember how our Lord himself said that Abraham had rejoiced to see his day?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.920]   God had given him a glimpse of the coming of Jesus of Nazareth, the son of God.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.280]   And he gave it him partly through this incident of the sacrifice of Isaac.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.520]   It's one of these great demonstrations, proclamations of God to his servant Abraham.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.920]   He's giving him a peep into the plan of salvation.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.040]   The blood of bulls and of goats can't do it.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.240]   Well, what's going to happen then?
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.160]   That's the question of Isaac.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.200]   Where's the lamb?
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.480]   Where is the sacrifice?
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.080]   And there's only one answer.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.840]   God will provide a lamb.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.720]   There it is a way back in Abraham.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.200]   And you follow it right through the whole of your Old Testament.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.680]   And it goes on repeating like a great echo.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.200]   God will provide a lamb.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:02.800]   And then a day came when a strange man called John the Baptist suddenly appeared and began
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.560]   to preach repentance to the children of Israel in the wilderness.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.400]   They hadn't seen anybody like this.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.000]   He was a man clad in the leather and girdle and the camel hair shirt.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.320]   He had nothing but locusts and wild honey.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.360]   He was a preacher of righteousness, a preacher of judgment.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.400]   He told people to flee from the wrath to come.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.360]   He warned them and they crowded out to listen to him.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:28.560]   But one day he was standing with two of his disciples with him.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.720]   And Jesus of Nazareth passed by.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.960]   And John pointed to him and said to his two followers,
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:40.080]   "Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.320]   The promise to Abraham is fulfilled.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.720]   God will provide the lamb.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.240]   And God has provided the lamb.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.360]   And the lamb is none other than his only begotten dearly beloved son.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:01.600]   The lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.960]   But the question is, why all this?
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.280]   Why is this necessary?
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:14.000]   Why should Jesus of Nazareth have left the courts of glory and be born as a helpless babe?
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.760]   Here he is, the one through whom everything that was made was made
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.160]   and without him was nothing made that is made.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.040]   He upholds all things by the word of his power.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.440]   But he's lying as a helpless babe in a manger.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:25.940]   Why?
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.840]   If God is just to say, "I forgive you, I have forgiven you.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.280]   I'm loved, there's no problem."
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:31.920]   Why that?
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.360]   Why the humiliation?
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.400]   Why the coming down?
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.080]   Why the suffering of poverty?
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.000]   Why being born in a stable?
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.880]   Why born amongst the lowing of the cattle and the straw?
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.240]   Why live in abject poverty?
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.760]   Why endure the buffetings and the insults of a fallen humanity as he did?
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.520]   Why sweat drops of blood in the garden of Gethsemane?
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.720]   Why suffer the indignity of a trial and condemnation?
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.560]   Why be nailed to a tree in agony and break his heart?
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.600]   Why, I ask?
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.680]   And there's only one answer.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.560]   It is the only way whereby even God can forgive us.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.320]   All men have failed.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.280]   All men have sinned.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.800]   No man can keep the commandments of God and live to the glory of God.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:28.160]   No man can erase his own past sins or get rid of them.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:28.880]   They're there.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:34.320]   "What I have written, I have written," said Pilate.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.080]   And we can all say the same thing.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.120]   You can't withdraw it.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.000]   You can't undo it.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.160]   Well, then you say, "Why not create another perfect man
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.440]   if God is all-powerful?
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.720]   If he created one perfect man called Adam, why not try again?"
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.400]   The answer is, he knew perfectly well that as Adam, the perfect man,
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.720]   had fallen and had failed and was duped and deluded by Satan,
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.600]   so another perfect man would also.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:04.880]   There is only one way whereby men can be forgiven and delivered
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.560]   and set free and at liberty.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:11.200]   And it is the way that God himself has devised.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:17.040]   It necessitates the coming of the Son of God into this world.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.880]   There's no other way.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.720]   If there had been, it would have happened.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.920]   If God by any other means could have delivered us and forgiven us
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.960]   and restored the cosmos, he would have done so.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:31.440]   But there was no other way.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.720]   There was none other good enough to pay the price of sin.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.800]   This is God's plan formulated before the foundation of the world.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.920]   He's going to send his own Son into the world, the Son of God.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.200]   He's going to take unto him human nature.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.040]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.000]   This is the record.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.200]   This is Christianity.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.080]   Jesus of Nazareth is not just a man amongst men.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:05.040]   He is God, the eternal Son, become man, taking human nature unto himself.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.560]   He hasn't ceased to be God.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.840]   He is perfect God.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.760]   He is also perfect man.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.800]   And you see, God had let Abraham into the secret.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.920]   That is why our Lord himself said,
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:24.960]   "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad."
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:31.360]   Why did Abraham rejoice to see the day of Jesus Christ?
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.800]   Why did he, why was his heart gladdened?
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.760]   Why was he filled with a sense of rapture and of glory?
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.040]   There's only one answer.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:45.920]   Abraham knew the failure, his own failure, the failure of the whole of mankind.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.800]   He'd been given this son Isaac, but he was also a sinner.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.600]   He knew that the whole of mankind had failed.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.240]   God said to Abraham, "I'm going to do this.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.360]   I'm going to start a new humanity.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.280]   I'm going to send my own Son down.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:06.320]   He'll take unto himself a purified human nature out of the womb,
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.240]   out of the ovary of a woman.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.200]   I'll perfect it.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.960]   I'll cleanse it by the Spirit.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.960]   I'll have a seed there of a new humanity joined to the Godhead.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.600]   He'll be the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.200]   He'll be a second Adam.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.240]   He'll be the last Adam, the second man.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:28.480]   In him, I'm going to make a new start and form this new nation,
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.720]   this new people who will live to my glory and to my praise."
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.440]   That's the explanation.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.560]   But still, you may ask, "Why the death?
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.000]   I can see some purpose in God sending his Son into the world to tell us that God loves us.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.360]   But why was the Son of God put to death upon the cross?
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.520]   Why had he to die as he said he had to?"
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.640]   And you see, there's only one answer.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.440]   It is the holiness of God.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.400]   Sin has got to be punished.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.960]   God doesn't remain God if he doesn't punish sin.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.360]   God can't just say, "I forgive you."
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.040]   If he could, I say it with reverence, he would have done it.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.920]   Would God have abandoned his Son to the death of the cross
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   if that wasn't absolutely essential?
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.200]   Why didn't he take him to heaven as he took Elias and others?
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.480]   No, no.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.120]   It had to be.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:32.160]   God must be just, even in forgiveness.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.160]   And there's only one way.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.920]   He has provided his own lamb.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.680]   God will provide the lamb.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:48.240]   And the lamb that he has provided is the one of whom Isaac was a kind of prototype.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.080]   Isaac was Abraham's only son.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.520]   And Jesus of Nazareth is God's own son.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:08.800]   gave him to the death of the cross, the shame, the ignominy, the agony,
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:14.240]   the suffering, the death, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.720]   but have everlasting life.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:21.680]   God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.000]   It is by his stripes that we are healed.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.200]   We beheld him stricken, smitten of God.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.920]   God the Father has laid him upon the altar.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.480]   And he has spared him nothing.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:42.080]   He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all,
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.320]   how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.280]   My dear friends, this is the Christian message.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.920]   We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels,
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:03.280]   for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor,
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:11.120]   that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.320]   That's the Christian message.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:22.240]   For you to be forgiven has cost God the death of his only begotten son.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.800]   He's made him to be a sinner.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.560]   He's laid your sins upon him.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.320]   And when the son looked into the face of God, as he thought, he couldn't see him.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.120]   So he cried out in the agony of dereliction,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.680]   "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.760]   It was because he'd been made an offering for sin.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:48.400]   He was the Lamb of God, slain from the foundation of the world.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:54.000]   My dear friend, this is what God revealed to Abraham.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   There's nothing new, as it were, in Jesus Christ.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.480]   It's a part of this great plan.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.680]   All the burnt offerings and sacrifices, they're all pointing to him.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.440]   The daily lambs, and all the other offerings.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:14.640]   The Lamb of God, the taker of the way, the sin of the world.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.960]   You don't understand, of course you don't.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:17.840]   Who can?
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.920]   This is the mystery of godliness.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.640]   Are you trying to pit your feeble intellect against this?
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.120]   This most amazing thing in God?
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:29.760]   This reconciliation of love and justice, righteousness and mercy.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.640]   The most amazing thing that ever has happened or ever can happen.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.720]   There will never be anything to eclipse this.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:47.040]   Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.320]   That's the Christian message.
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.760]   Your first need is the need of forgiveness.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.680]   God won't bless you until you're forgiven.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.480]   The enmity is going to be removed.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.560]   You need to be reconciled to God.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.760]   And God was in Christ, through Christ.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.160]   Reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:15.040]   Not imputing their trespasses unto them.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.520]   Have you believed this message?
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:23.040]   This is God's plan for the redemption of men.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:29.440]   And ultimately, the redemption of the entire cosmos.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.920]   What have you done with this message?
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.920]   Have you believed it?
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.080]   Have you accepted it?
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.360]   Have you gladly yielded yourself to it?
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.840]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:51.360]   And thou shalt be saved.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:56.480]   And the salvation that you will begin to experience and to enjoy
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:03.600]   will go on amazing you increasingly through the countless ages of eternity.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.000]   Believe on him.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:13.440]   The God of glory that appeared to Abram and told him that he so loved the world
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.880]   that it rebelled against him.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:19.040]   That he was going to send his only begotten son into it, even to death.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.640]   That men might be saved.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.340]   Amen.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:31.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
