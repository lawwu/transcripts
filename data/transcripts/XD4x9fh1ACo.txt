[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.440]   found in Paul's epistle to the Colossians in the first chapter and
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.600]   reading from the third to the seventh verse. We give thanks to God and the
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.360]   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you since we heard of your
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.440]   faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which he have to all the saints for the
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.880]   hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.000]   the truth of the gospel which is come unto you as it is in all the world and
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.880]   bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.000]   knew the grace of God in truth as he also learned of Epaphras our dear
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.240]   fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of Christ now we come back to a
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.120]   consideration of this most interesting statement but we want to concentrate
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.640]   particularly this evening on the first statement in the fifth verse the first
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.280]   statement in the fifth verse of this first chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:22.900]   Colossians for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven now I'm calling
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.720]   attention to this particular paragraph this particular statement because in it
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.740]   the Apostle gives a very wonderful summary of the Christian gospel and the
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.600]   Christian message I've been explaining the two previous Sunday evenings how he
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.160]   came to do that he's writing here to a number of Christian people in this
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.440]   church at Colossae he hadn't seen most of them they hadn't seen him they hadn't
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.760]   become Christians through his ministry but that doesn't matter at all this man
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.600]   sent out by the Apostles a man called Epaphras had preached the same message
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.680]   and under the influence of his preaching these people had believed and they'd
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.040]   been formed together into a church so it is the church at Colossae and the
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.400]   Apostle writes to and he does so in order that he may establish them in what
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.240]   they've believed in order that he may make quite certain that they really have
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.000]   got the true message that became necessary as I've been indicating
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.480]   because there were certain people in the early church as there are in the church
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.440]   today who went about vicing their own opinions teaching vague philosophies and
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.360]   innocent people were ready to listen to them and thus they'd become confused and
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.440]   uncertain some of them were beginning to wonder what Christianity really is who
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.600]   the Lord Jesus Christ really is and what exactly he's done now the Apostle writes
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   his letter because of that situation he makes that perfectly clear in the second
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.920]   chapter there it's explicit its implicit here from the very beginning well now in
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.440]   doing that you see he does give this very wonderful summary he reminds them
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.480]   here in these few verses of what it was they had heard from Epaphras and he said
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.840]   that's the real thing that's the thing to hold on to don't listen to these
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   other purveyors of these false Gospels that are not Gospels don't be entangled
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.280]   he says in human philosophies and all these speculations that sound so clever
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.160]   and so wonderful but which are not the gospel at all now I'm doing the same
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.480]   thing in my own feeble manner I'm trying to hold before you this message of the
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.240]   Apostle which is as contemporary as it was when he first wrote it and which is
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.080]   needed our less as badly as it was in the church at Colossae and in other
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:57.400]   churches for we are in a time of confusion it's not surprising that the
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.780]   Christian Church should be as she is what are people to believe when they
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.720]   hear all these strange voices saying this is Christianity well what I'm
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.560]   proposing is this that we do the only sensible thing and the sensible thing is
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.760]   this that we forget all about what is called Christendom as it's rounded about
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.040]   us today try your best to forget all that's being plugged into you and the
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.720]   television and the wireless and the newspapers about great councils and
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.280]   gatherings of Christians I don't care where they are now what label they have
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.800]   attached to them I say let's try for the time being to forget all about them now
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.720]   let's get back to the New Testament let's find what the thing was at the
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.960]   beginning that's the way to find the truth of any message we know how these
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.720]   accretions tend to gather to any kind of teaching and do you see in the very
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.920]   early days of the church they began to gather themselves around this wonderful
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.360]   message and to turn it into something that wasn't a gospel at all now I say
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.900]   the only antidote to this kind of position and condition is go back to the
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.080]   beginning look at a little gathering like this in Colossae they were not even
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.720]   in a building like this still less a great Cathedral they met in a house they
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.560]   met in one another's houses and they had their simple meetings that's
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.800]   Christianity that's the church that's the beginning that's the origin that's
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.880]   the truth thing and that's the thing surely that we all must be anxious to
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.040]   know about this message that went round that ancient world went round the Roman
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.720]   Empire and here and there in places like Colossae these little groups gather
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.120]   together the Christian Church and eventually she became such a great power
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.160]   that she was able to influence the whole of the Roman Empire now we needn't go
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.120]   after that but all I'm saying is this is the primitive the original thing this is
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.680]   true Christianity and here we have the apostle the greatest of all the
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.600]   apostles giving his own summary of what exactly it was he says I'm writing to
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.400]   you at Colossae and all I want to do he says is to confirm what Epaphras has
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.800]   already told you because he told you the right thing now we've been looking into
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.120]   it what is it well the first thing was that it was a gospel which means good
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.080]   news and if your notion of Christianity doesn't carry with it this idea of good
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.120]   news this thrilling good news it isn't Christianity whatever else it may be it
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.000]   may be morality it may be ethics it may be philosophy it may be politics not
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.720]   Christianity Christianity is good news and then he went on to say that not only
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.840]   is it gospel but it's a true gospel the word of the truth of the gospel or the
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.680]   word of the true gospel there's only one true gospel and there's no other so this
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.640]   man writing to the Galatians says though we are an angel from heaven preach any
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.440]   other gospel unto you than that which we have preached let him be accursed he's a
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.320]   liar it's not true don't listen to it it's a true gospel and then he went on
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.480]   to say that it's the only gospel this thing that's gone right round the world
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.520]   it's the only gospel there is no other and then last thunder night we were
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.280]   looking at it in terms of what he calls here a word where are we heard before in
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.560]   the word of the truth of the gospel which you remember we interpreted as
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:30.400]   meaning this that Christianity is not just a nice feeling a man becomes a
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.360]   Christian when he believes a body of truth isn't some wonderful idealistic
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.440]   thought that gives you a nice feeling no no it's a body of doctrine it's a word
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.480]   it's a it comes in statements in propositions it can be defined that's
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.360]   why these men can say that certain men are heretics that they're wrong in what
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.720]   they were teaching and they warned the church is not to listen to them now you
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   couldn't do that if you hadn't got a body of doctrine if Christianity is a
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.000]   vague feeling well what right am I to say that the other man's a vague feeling
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.120]   isn't as good as mine if it's a matter of feelings well one's as good as
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.200]   another but it isn't that as we saw it is primarily something that is addressed
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.960]   to the mind it is truth and it's a word it's a body of truth and of doctrine and
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.480]   it comes to us and it makes its specific statements and we saw that all these
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.960]   apostles and other preachers preached the same doctrine we saw furthermore that
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.880]   the passage of years doesn't make any difference to it and the fact that this
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.640]   is 1962 and not 62 doesn't make any difference at all because what we are
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.720]   dealing with here is God who's everlasting and unchangeable the father
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.440]   of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning and we're
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.560]   dealing with men who doesn't change either though he may be clever enough to
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.360]   do things now that he couldn't do in 62 he's still the same being still the same
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.680]   creature still the same sinner still the same creature of lusts and passions and
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.040]   desires he talks a lot about his intellect but he behaves exactly as he's
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.680]   always done so there's no difference and you see all our new knowledge it doesn't
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.440]   give us any more knowledge about God nor about the way to know him and to be
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.400]   blessed of him it's the same message it can't change it never will we are
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.200]   concerned about the truth once and forever delivered to the Saints it is
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.640]   once and forever nobody can add to this any man who thinks that because he lives
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.680]   in 1962 that he knows more about God than the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.480]   Apostle Paul there's only one thing to say about him he's a fool he better
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:46.320]   start thinking he's just a fool all the flux of time makes no difference to God
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.960]   and the knowledge of God so we find that it is this once and for all message and
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.160]   what is it about well there it was that's where we ended last Sunday night
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.120]   it's about the grace of God which is come to you as it is in all the world
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.540]   and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day he heard of it and
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:13.440]   knew the grace of God in truth grace is favor to the undeserving and we are all
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.400]   undeserving this is the message of the gospel that all of us who are hell-bound
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.840]   sinners and deserve nothing but hell that God in his grace has looked upon us
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:31.240]   and has sent his Son into the world in order to set us free grace that's it
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:38.400]   bread and wine broken body shed blood of the Son of God what for Oh God so loved
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.800]   the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:52.080]   should not perish but have everlasting life that's grace the grace of God
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.960]   unmerited undeserved favor but that's what God has done God hath visited and
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.880]   redeemed his people he's done this for a world that had sinned and rebelled
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.960]   against him ignored and broken his commandments and had gone its own way to
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:14.200]   destruction the grace of God that's it well now then that leaves us with the
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   question what's God's object in doing all this why is the grace of God ever
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.960]   done this why did God ever send his Son out of heaven and to be born as a baby
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.360]   in Bethlehem and to do all he did why did Christ die on the cross what's the
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.640]   meaning of this bread and wine God always has a purpose he never does
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.600]   anything for the sake of doing it he never does anything haphazardly God's
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.840]   got a great plan and purpose according to this message well what is it the
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.260]   grace of God bringing salvation hath appeared says this same writer to Titus
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:58.560]   now why why has it appeared why has God's great purpose of grace ever been
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.320]   put into operation what's at the back of all this what's the objective that God
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:11.600]   is aiming at in all that he's done in and through his dear son what do you
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:17.040]   think the answer is to that question well that's the very matter we are
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.480]   considering together tonight we give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.400]   Jesus Christ praying always for you since we heard of your faith in Christ
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.080]   Jesus and of the love which you have to all the saints what's he giving thanks
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:38.560]   for oh he says for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof of
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.760]   which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which is come
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.060]   unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.200]   you since the day heard of it and knew the grace of God in truth as you also
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.240]   learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant what was it they heard the hope
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:08.920]   which is laid up in heaven for you that's the object of it all that's the
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:18.840]   grand objective of the grace of God the hope which is laid up in heaven for you
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:28.520]   all you who believe now my friends I venture to suggest to you that this is
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:34.600]   one of the most surprising things that we've ever heard one of the most
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:41.280]   unexpected but here it is it's in the summary it's in the synopsis at the
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.320]   beginning this is one of the vital fundamental statements of the Christian
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:56.240]   gospel the hope that is laid up for you in heaven oh it's not only surprising
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.560]   this is one of these statements that enables us to see exactly whether we are
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.680]   Christians or not and whether we've ever been right in our thinking as to
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.960]   what Christianity is here you notice is the only thing that he picks out when he
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.720]   talks about the object of salvation the purpose of grace this is the one thing
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   he says the hope that is laid up for you in heaven now let me put it simply and
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.360]   bluntly like this it's when you look at a phrase like this that you see that the
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.520]   gospel of Jesus Christ is altogether and entirely different from everything the
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:43.120]   world has ever known or has ever thought there's no question about that this kind
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.800]   of statement cuts right across all our habitual thinking this is how we put it
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:56.160]   isn't it our idea of Christianity is this we say what we want is something
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.980]   practical what we want is something to help us to live in this world what we
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.760]   want is something to make this world a better place that's why we come to
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.840]   chapel that's why we listen to your preaching we are conscious of the state
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.820]   of the world and it's terrible and we see politics failing the statesman
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.440]   failing all the conferences failing we come to the Christian Church we say now
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.840]   look here have you got anything to say can you make this world a better place
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.640]   can you give us some help to live in this world that's what we want to know
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:33.160]   from you and here you are says someone you give us nothing but pie in the sky
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   hope laid up for you in heaven that's it that's just the trouble with your
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.840]   Christianity isn't that the modern man's reaction isn't that always the reaction
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.720]   of the world to this message I hoped I'd have something to help me here and now
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.480]   says the man I'm not interested in heaven and hell I'm not interested in
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.360]   some remote possibility I want something to help me now I'm having a difficult
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.440]   time and the world is in flames rounded about me and you anything to say to me
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.640]   isn't Christianity a message that's going to put the world right and here
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:10.800]   you are talking about hope laid up in heaven heaven and hell pie in the sky
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.440]   ah says the modern man that's why I've turned my back on your Christianity long
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:21.680]   ago it's too small it's too selfish and the thinking of it saving your own little
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.240]   soul your own skin with a world with these gigantic problems don't you know
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.040]   anything about these rockets they're sending up these vast spaces and you're
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.880]   asking me to think about my little soul and it's destiny in heaven
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.320]   ah says the man it's it's disgustingly small it's selfish and worse than that
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.600]   it's your escapism that's the trouble says the men of the world with you a
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.760]   Christianity doesn't face the facts it doesn't stand up to life it gathers your
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.080]   people together you pull down your blinds you sing your hymns and you say
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.240]   isn't it going to be wonderful and you're not standing up to life you're
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:02.560]   not being men you're miserable people lurking there into some distant future
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.800]   pure escapism well now I suggest to you that that is the way in which the world
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.360]   thinks habitually of its problems and of the Christian message and that is what
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.560]   it expects of Christianity so that when it hears something like this it's an eye
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.000]   and it's disgusted it feels it's all wrong it's impatient with it will have
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.520]   nothing at all to do with it isn't that right well you see this is very vital
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:34.480]   isn't it let me grant this much let me grant this quite honestly I want to be
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.640]   fair there have been many people under the name of Christian who have
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:46.840]   misrepresented it badly in that way they have just lived a selfish little life
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.860]   and they've not been interested in or concerned about anything else I have no
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.800]   doubt at all that the messes of the so-called working people in this country
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.320]   today are outside the church and won't even listen to the gospel because far
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.280]   too many who claim to be Christian in the last century in the first 14 years
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.880]   of this century we're so selfish and self-centered that they give very little
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.120]   thought to the suffering of others and there's no defense of it there's no
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.640]   excuse for it that is the failure of Christians to apply what they believe I
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:28.120]   wouldn't defend it for a second that's hopelessly wrong but remember the so
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.600]   called social gospel was equally wrong which taught that Christianity is
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.320]   nothing but some kind of way of introducing by legislation the kingdom
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.840]   of God into this world of time that Christianity is nothing but a political
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.480]   social problem program which is going to put everything right that is equally
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.040]   wrong they're both wrong let's turn from them both ever and look at this
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:19:00.600]   message as it is put here before us now you see my argument is this it's the
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:06.640]   Apostle Paul who makes this statement it isn't my statement this is what he says
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.600]   to the Church of Colossae so you see if we want to know what primitive
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.080]   Christianity is here it is now we've already seen this the two previous
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.200]   Sunday nights but I've got to repeat it again tonight you see at this point
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:27.320]   you're in one of two positions you either accept this because it comes with
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:34.720]   all the authority of an apostle or else you reject it it's got to be one or the
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.400]   other if you say well I want to know what all this is I'm tired of listening
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.320]   to these conflicting statements let's go back to the beginning and find out what
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:49.000]   primitive Christianity was here is primitive Christianity and we either
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.400]   admit it and accept it and submit ourselves to it or else I say we've
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.560]   just got to reject it and say well I don't agree with that what I want is
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.400]   something that will help me here and now and put the world in order and make the
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.080]   world a better place and I'm not interested in any other message very
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:08.760]   well my friend it's your decision but all I'm saying is that if you say that
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:14.400]   well then you're turning your back on primitive Christianity and you're
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:21.760]   believing that something is gospel which is not a gospel for this is plain New
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.880]   Testament teaching it isn't an odd phrase like this at the beginning of the
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.240]   epistle to the Colossians it is the universal teaching of the whole of the
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.920]   New Testament what was one of the last things our blessed Lord himself said to
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:45.160]   his followers listen let not your heart be troubled he believe in God believe
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.600]   also in me don't be troubled he says why well because I'm going to make this
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.700]   world a better place because I'm going to reform it not at all in my father's
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:02.560]   house are many mansions that's the comfort that's the consolation nothing
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.640]   here in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.840]   told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.880]   I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there he may be
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.920]   also in the world he says he shall have tribulations but fear not I have
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.960]   overcome the world marvel not he says if the world hate you it hated me before it
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:33.800]   hated you the whole of his teaching is precisely this there it is I say in the
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.160]   teaching of our Lord himself but it was the universal teaching of all these
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.620]   Apostles look at a man like the Apostle Peter writing his first epistle again to
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.760]   Christian people in great trouble and tribulations and trials what does he say
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.960]   to them what's his comfort here's his comfort blessed be the God and father of
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.000]   our Lord Jesus Christ which hath begotten us again and to our lively hope
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.720]   by the resurrection of the Jesus Christ from the dead unto an inheritance
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.800]   incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in him in
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.520]   heaven it's reserved so on he goes in the 13th verse of the first chapter of
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:23.000]   that first epistle wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.160]   the end for the grace which is to be revealed unto you at the coming of the
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:37.000]   Lord Jesus Christ same thing always the same thing it's the great burden of his
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.960]   second epistle in exactly the same way look at James even James writing his
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.480]   epistle and his comforting people they were enduring great suffering many of
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.680]   these workmen this is his comfort hold on he says the coming of the Lord
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:56.480]   draweth nigh that's the comfort that's the consolation and he's got nothing
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:03.800]   else to offer them it's the same with John beloved says John now are we the
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.760]   sons of God and we know not yet what we shall be but we know that when he shall
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:14.080]   appear we shall see him as he is and shall be like him same thing what's the
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.620]   message of the book of Revelations it's just this you see the book of
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:23.080]   Revelations was written to comfort the first Christians I know there are
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.880]   friends who think that it's written for some people were yet to appear and that
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.780]   it has no message no but that's utterly wrong it was written to comfort the
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.960]   people for whom it was written and what's the comfort well the comfort is
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.840]   you see this great event this blessed hope it's it's one message from
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   beginning to end to comfort Christians in all ages and in all generations and
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.280]   here we have this apostle what you've heard he says is the hope which is laid
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.400]   up for you in him he keeps on saying this everywhere our citizenship is in
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   heaven he says to the Philippians from whence also we expect the Savior it's in
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.600]   heaven look what do we read in the beginning out of 2 Corinthians 4 our
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.400]   light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.520]   exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.640]   are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen a
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.760]   temporal the things which are not seen are eternal we know that if our earthly
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.440]   house of this tabernacle be dissolved we have a building of God and house not
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:34.040]   made with hens eternal in the heaven I mustn't keep you I've simply quoted
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.200]   scripture at random in order to establish my contention that this is not
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.400]   just an odd bit of teaching here or there it is the universal teaching of
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.720]   the whole of the New Testament the Lord and all the Apostles this is the message
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.960]   everywhere well now then the question is what's it mean what's he mean by saying
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.660]   that what pleases him so much and he gives thanks to God the father of our
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.360]   Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you what what about world for the hope that
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.960]   is laid up for you in heaven what's it mean what is this message this is basic
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:13.600]   essential Christianity it cuts across all our thinking I say it comes as a
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.880]   surprise to us what does it tell us well let me try and divide it up here's the
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:25.080]   first point it's a great message of course of the Bible from beginning to
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.640]   end and the message in the first place is this it's a message that emphasizes
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:40.320]   the transitory nature and character of life in this world that's the great
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:47.400]   message of the Bible the exact opposite of what we all think by nature we regard
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:52.440]   this world as the only world that we said this is the real world the bird in
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:58.000]   hand is worth two in the bush this world I see this I know I'm in it that's what
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.760]   I'm interested in and this we feel is the real world this we feel is the
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.560]   tangible world this we feel is the lasting world so we talk about settling
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.400]   down in this world and man has always been trying to do that he's interested
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.640]   in life in this world he tries to perpetuate it that's his main interest
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.280]   in trying to abolish war at the present time he's just safeguarding and
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.520]   perpetuating life in this world he looks at this world only and this is all to
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:31.200]   him and there's nothing else but this world and the Bible comes and it
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:38.640]   contradicts it completely and entirely what is your life says James this life
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:44.680]   you talk so much about this wonderful life this thrilling life this real life
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:55.040]   what is it what is your life it's but as a vapor go to he says go to you men who
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.920]   talk so glibly and so cleverly and about what you are going to do and what you
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:04.240]   propose listen says this man you don't know what you're talking about go to now
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.840]   you that say today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a city and continue
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:14.040]   there a year and buy and sell and get gain that's how we speak isn't it we've
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:19.080]   got an endless lease on life and we are in this solid world not this world a
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:24.520]   make-belief not this pie in the sky not this spiritual unseen that well that
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.880]   may be there or may not be there this is the solid and the real world and today
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:33.600]   and tomorrow and next year and so on we plan go to says this man whereas you
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:40.560]   know not what you'll be on the morrow for what is your life it is even it is
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:51.480]   only a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanishes away now that's
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:59.000]   the message of the whole Bible life is but a pilgrim it says the Bible we are
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.920]   but pilgrims and strangers we are but journeymen and travelers Moses the
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.040]   author probably of the 90th psalm has put it all in a great phrase teach us so
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:16.600]   to number our days that we may apply our hearts and to wisdom in other words you
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.680]   see this is the great message everywhere it's the message of the patriarchs look
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:27.520]   at those men described in Hebrews chapter 11 those Giants people like Abel
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:36.040]   and Abraham and Moses David gigantic men men who left their impress upon the whole
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.140]   of civilization men who lived as Giants in this world of time what's their
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:49.280]   secret well they confessed that they were but strangers and pilgrims they had
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.600]   seen the truth that this life is a passing one a very transient one and
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.760]   that they were but moving through it and moving constantly and not able to stay
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.820]   you can't settle down in it you're always moving you're always older every
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.040]   day you're a day older and you're nearer that end you come in and you go
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:15.680]   out nothing lives but something dies change and decay and all around I see
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.200]   brief life is here our portion that's the universal message of the Bible you
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.120]   see the Bible is here shouting this at us listen it says you who want to do
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.520]   everything in this life and world and settle in this and do this and that with
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:35.160]   it listen it's a passing world it's a transitory existence you're all moving
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.840]   and moving very rapidly and you don't know when you'll be out of it that's
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:48.320]   what Epaphras preached in Colossae that is the message of Christianity he didn't
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.800]   preach about political and social conditions in the Roman Empire he just
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.640]   said the whole of life is a transient matter there's the first note let me
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.680]   hurry to the second then you see having pointed that out and it's simply a fact
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.120]   of course what fools we are that we don't recognize it don't we fool
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:11.320]   ourselves my dear friends we see that we're in the midst of life in death and
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.840]   yet you see we go on living as if we are to be here forever and that this is the
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.320]   only solid in real world we know it isn't where are our forefathers they've
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.720]   gone they're no longer here and we'll soon be gone and others will be here
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   probably but having established that it goes on to the second point which is the
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.320]   immortality of the soul I put it like that for the sake of convenience what I
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.360]   mean is this Epaphras having pointed out to them the transitory nature of life
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:48.200]   said look here the thing for you to concentrate on then is that in you which
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.000]   doesn't in a sense belong to this world at all but belongs to another realm and
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.840]   that is what is called the soul you see the life lived in this world is a life
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.600]   mainly of the body the faculties and the powers of the body even including the
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:07.740]   mind that's the kind of life we live in this world but there's another faculty
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:13.840]   and this other faculty can penetrate beyond the seam and the visible this
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.360]   faculty that we all know of if we stop to think for a moment men have expressed
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:27.560]   this in different ways our birth is but asleep and forgetting the soul that
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.000]   riseth with us our life star has heard elsewhere it's setting and cometh from
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.480]   afar owed on the intimations of immortality that thing within us that
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:50.080]   enables us in seasons of calm weather though inland far we be our eyes catch
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.900]   sight of that immortal see that brought us hither and can in a moment take us
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:32:00.000]   thither and see the children sporting on the shore and here the mighty waters
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:10.240]   rolling evermore the unseen the spiritual the life of the soul and of
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.280]   the spirit that which is not tangible that which is not material and yet it's
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.880]   the biggest thing in us we belong to another realm though we are here in this
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   tent of clay for just a little while there's that within us that's bigger
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:30.360]   than it all the soul the life lived in the body says them is this message is
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:36.280]   only temporary but the other life is the only thing that matters because it goes
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.280]   on when the body is finished and left behind and may be buried in a grave and
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:48.200]   may be treated with the worms and rots into nothing when all the beauty of the
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:56.720]   form has vanished the soul still there and it goes on that's what Christianity
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.120]   talks about you see oh but I'm interested in this world says man I want
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.760]   to get this world better I want to get some security here my dear friend that's
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:09.480]   where you go wrong you're putting the wrong thing first what about your soul
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:16.000]   this life has got to end it will end and the soul will go on epaphras talk to
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.440]   them about this this intangible immaterial thing the soul the spirit of
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.040]   men he says listen to me when you die he says you go out of your body but your
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.800]   naked spirit goes on and it stands before God in judgment and it gives an
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.440]   account of itself for God gave us this soul and spirit and he meant us to use
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.600]   it to his glory and he will challenge us and examine us as to what we've done
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:48.040]   with it and we will be judged in terms of debt and the result of the judgment
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:54.360]   is one of two fates either eternal happiness and bliss or else eternal
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:03.040]   misery and loss heaven and hell heaven and hell believe my message said
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.920]   epaphras and there is a hope laid up for you which is indescribably in its glory
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:17.600]   reject it and you go to the hopelessness of what the Bible calls hell now this is
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.240]   it this is the message this is what he's talking about so then I go on to my
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:25.880]   third point which I put like this that the Bible in addition to laying down
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.640]   those great fundamental principles about the fleeting nature of life and the
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.600]   importance of the soul and its eternal destiny the Bible then gives us a very
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   realistic view of life in this world and this is what to me proves if nothing
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:47.160]   else did that this is the Word of God because it tells me the truth all along
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.560]   if I had no other reason I say for believing it to be the Word of God
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.160]   that's be enough for me because it tells me the truth about life in this world I
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.120]   read other things my newspapers and the philosophers and so on and you see with
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.520]   their great idealism they try to tell me that this world is a wonderful place the
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.920]   world tonight outside Christ says isn't life wonderful is it have you found it
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.320]   wonderful like that is life wonderful is it thrilling is it exciting is it
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:18.120]   marvelous is it just one round of pleasure and of happiness is that have
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:26.200]   you found it that's the fairy tale to believe that to believe that the world
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.800]   has ever been like that or that the world ever will be like that that's the
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.120]   fairy tale if you want realism come here here it is it tells you all about it
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:40.200]   what does it tell you well what it tells you is this that this world is a place
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:50.880]   of sin a place of sorrow a place of sighing a place of bitterness of enmity
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:59.320]   of fighting selfishness greed malice that's what it says oh it can go even
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.400]   worse than that you know he tells us that there are times when men are so
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:08.960]   sunk and steeped in sin and iniquity that they become perverts it's all here
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.880]   there's nothing you can produce to me in a book or in a newspaper but that I'll
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:22.280]   show it you here described in stark realism that's life says the Bible it's
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:28.880]   a place of tribulations in the world ye shall have tribulations says the Son of
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.400]   God he doesn't promise anything better the Lord Jesus Christ never promised
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.600]   anybody a life of ease a man came running after him one afternoon and said
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.000]   master I want to follow you wherever you're going wait a minute my friend he
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.600]   said foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:55.540]   doth not wear to lay his head you ready for that he said no no he never painted
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.520]   a rosy picture of life he said it's a place of tribulation it's a veil of woe
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.680]   and why well do you see the Bible's got its explanation it's all because of men's
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:09.560]   sin and disobedience the world is as it is because it has sinned and rebelled
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.420]   against God and because in its folly it's trying to live life apart from God
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:18.400]   and God has said there is no peace saith my God to the wicked there isn't any you
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.200]   shan't have any you can become wealthy and learned you can split your atom you
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.520]   can organize your common market you can do a thousand and one things but
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:31.040]   they'll never be peace while you continue to be wicked and live a life
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.200]   apart from me that's what the Bible says now I'm giving you the message that a
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.760]   paraphrase preached in Colossae he said that's the sort of world it is and it
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.880]   will never be better now then are you sorry you came to this service do you
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.480]   say this is sure pessimism this is this is just depressing my friend this is
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.800]   truth this is fact this is what you really know to be true when you're
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:02.560]   honest this is life Christianity is not a fairy tale it's everything else is the
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:08.000]   fairy tale this really does stand up to it and look at it as it is and it puts
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.680]   it down in black and white it says that's the core that's the sort of world
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.320]   it is and it is that because of men's rebellion and arrogant disobedience of
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.560]   God and it'll never be better until man is changed there's no hope of reforming
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.720]   the world there's no hope that the world will ever become ultimately perfect
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:29.000]   believe me evolution the theory of evolution is a blank denial of the
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.840]   Christian message the world has not evolved it is not evolving man remains
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.960]   exactly where he's always been because men and the world are under the wrath of
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:46.400]   God and the world is doomed because it is under the wrath of God now that
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.880]   doesn't mean for a moment that we should be unconcerned about it that
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.360]   doesn't mean that we shouldn't do the best to make it as good as we can of
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.960]   course go and do that for all you're worth but all I'm saying is this don't
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.280]   tell me that Christianity is out to make the world perfect it isn't it tells you
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:05.960]   that the world is under the wrath of God it is doomed the sentence has already
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.560]   been promulgated and it'll be carried on I know not when it may be sooner than
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:17.000]   some of us think the world is doomed and of course by now even some of your
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.480]   modern philosophers are beginning to get troubled about it all you're all the
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.520]   Saxleys and others who are not Christians they're beginning to think
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.720]   now the world may end because of starvation or because of the letting off
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.120]   of the bomb or this or that or the corroding of the land and things like
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.680]   that and these dust bowls in America will all be starving this if the
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.120]   population goes on multiplying as it does and the food shortage increases
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.960]   they're all beginning to talk about an end these men you see who turned their
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.880]   backs on Christianity and who used to be so optimistic and say education will put
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:53.720]   us right they can see an end coming because the man is sinful and because
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.680]   the world is in rebellion against God that's what the Bible teaches that's
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.200]   what this man preached at Colossae and then he went on to say this he said now
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   then there is the position you're moving through this world you'll only do it
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.080]   once you'll never come back again you've got a soul and you decide it's eternal
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.520]   destiny while you're here don't talk about making the world a
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.720]   better place make certain that you are somehow delivered from this doom that's
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:26.120]   coming and then he said I can tell you how it can happen and he began preaching
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.760]   the message of the gospel Jesus of Nazareth son of God who came down from
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.880]   heaven to earth and lived and died and rose again what for to lift up humanity
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.400]   to give a Philip to the human march of progress no no that whosoever believeth
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:48.760]   individuals the one who when he was thronged by a great crowd of people felt
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.000]   a poor woman tugging at the hem of his garment and a time to listen to her and
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.040]   to heal her and to cure her he is interested in individuals thank God
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.460]   that's his message that was the message of Epaphras he says look here you can be
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:06.060]   delivered out of this my salvation is a personal salvation the whole world is
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:11.120]   doomed under the judgment and the wrath of God but believe this message of Christ
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.840]   the Son of God and you will be delivered out of their doom but he said listen
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:25.720]   you are salvation even in Christ in this world is only partial only partial you
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.960]   don't get it all here you don't he didn't say believe on the Lord Jesus
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.720]   Christ you'll never have another problem you'll go marching down the highway with
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.320]   a new step and a new thrill you'll never meet another temptation all your
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.280]   problems will be solved you'll have answers to your prayers oh that's a
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:46.120]   travesty for the gospel don't believe it it's not true the New Testament has
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:53.960]   never said that never all it has said is this and this is its glorious message
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:59.000]   we only receive a little installment of salvation in this world thank God it's
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.520]   enough what is the installment well is this that it opens my eyes to this world
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.520]   in which we're living that's the first thing we all need this is the victory
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.920]   that overcometh the world even our faith how does it overcome it how does faith
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.000]   enable me to overcome it enables me to see through the world are you
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.360]   fascinated by the life of the West End of London if you are you're not a
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.640]   Christian if you can't see through that you're not born again you're not a
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:30.400]   Christian at all if you think that's wonderful if you think the life that's
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.200]   depicted on the films and in your novelettes that that's real life you
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:39.160]   haven't seen through it my dear friend and the first thing the gospel does is
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.160]   to enable you to see through that sort of thing this is the victory that
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.440]   overcometh the world even our faith it makes you see through that it makes you
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.640]   see your own need it makes you see that you are involved in that and it's doom
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.960]   then it shows you Christ dying for you and putting a right with God and you
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:02.240]   become a child of God and you begin to live a new life and God begins to smile
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   upon you and you know he's that he is your father then you see you know that
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.360]   all being well between you and God you need no longer be afraid of death you
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.920]   need no longer be afraid of the judgment you've passed from judgment into life
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.300]   Christ has put you right with God he's reconciled you to God not only that he
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:23.280]   will give you strength and power he will enable you listen to this man the
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.120]   Apostle Paul praying for these people for this cause also since the day we
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.800]   heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.040]   with the knowledge of his will it only started he wants them to be filled with
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.480]   the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.560]   might walk worthy of the Lord and to all pleasing being fruitful in every good
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.400]   work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:51.400]   according to his glorious power and to all patience and long-suffering with
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:55.200]   joyfulness it doesn't say we're going to change the world for you and you'll
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   walk in a magic circle no no what it does say is this you'll still be left in
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:07.480]   this same old evil world the world won't change but you'll be changed and you
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.440]   love Christ as your companion you love the strength of the Holy Spirit in you
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.800]   you see it doesn't promise that everything's going to be all right you
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.360]   did you hear Paul writing to those Corinthians in this tabernacle we do
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:25.520]   groan being burdened earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:30.260]   is from heaven what's he mean what he means is this that in this old evil
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:35.460]   sinful world a man who's a Christian must be burdened he must groan he sees
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:41.220]   sin vice evil he feels its power it shakes him at times and he groans he's
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.540]   afraid of himself even wonders whether he can stand but he's given the strength
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.780]   and the power he's not made perfect he's not taken out of the flesh he's not
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:55.140]   delivered from all sin in every shape or form of just not true no no his battles
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:59.080]   he fights it's the good fight of faith he's only got an installment of his
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.580]   salvation that's all he's offered but it's enough thank God to take him
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.380]   through and so he comes to the communion table and what does he say that well
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:14.020]   this is what he's told to say by the Apostle Paul if you eat of his bread and
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:19.940]   drink of his blood he says eat of his flesh and drink of his blood what are
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:29.380]   you doing you are showing the Lord's death till he come that's it showing the
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:33.820]   Lord's death proclaiming it saying yes it's enough I'm forgiven he keeps me
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:37.340]   going but I am not all I'm still imperfect I'm still lacking in
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.660]   knowledge I'm still weak and frail and I fail I fall into sin that's my condition
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.620]   the Lord's death my sins are blotted out thank God when I sin I don't feel full
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.980]   of despair I say the blood of Jesus Christ still cleanses me from all sin
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:56.140]   and unrighteousness but I'm only going on like this I declare the Lord's death
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:01.620]   till he come I've only got an installment here yes but the full
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:09.460]   salvation is coming for the hope which is laid up for you in him listen said a
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.500]   preface to these people what I've been telling you about this life and this
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:18.580]   world is nothing but the simple truth listen to my message you'll be unable to
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.420]   go through nobody else can everybody else is defeated and falls by the wayside
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:27.180]   they're killed and they're lost and they're damned and doomed you'll be kept
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.780]   going you'll have more than enough to keep you going you'll enjoy what you've
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:35.820]   got but it isn't everything you'll still be groaning in this tabernacle but
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.780]   listen to me he said there's a hope laid up for you in heaven there is a full
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:46.060]   salvation coming what is it oh it is what will happen when this blessed Lord
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:53.860]   will come again we do care the Lord's death till he come and he's coming if
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:59.100]   you want a message for this world here it is this whole world it's sinful it's
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:04.740]   vile it's evil it's rotten all your civilizations throughout the running
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.380]   centuries can do nothing with it at all look at the civilizations that have
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.940]   risen in China gone to nothing look at them in Persia look at them in Egypt
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.820]   look at them in Greece look at them in Rome look at them in Spain look at them
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:22.220]   in Great Britain they can't do it they can't touch the problem they never could
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:29.380]   they never will but listen there is a day coming when this whole world is
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.740]   going to be put right and that will be when the Son of God comes back into it
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:41.940]   again you see this is the hope laid up in heaven this is my position as a
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:47.940]   Christian I'm saved my sins are forgiven I'm a child of God I'm enabled to go
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:54.860]   through this world of sin and shame and sorrow and darkness and should I die
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:48:00.780]   before he comes again what it means is this that I shall be with the Lord for
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:06.700]   me to live is Christ and to die is gain to be with Christ which is far better
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:11.140]   when a Christian dies he goes immediately to be with the Lord that is
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.140]   if we die before he comes but he will come again at the end of time and of
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.140]   history he'll come back into this world and what will he come back for well he'll
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:24.420]   come back my friends in order to get rid of sin and evil then he really will get
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:29.540]   rid of it not until then he is getting rid of sin and evil and making this
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:35.340]   world perfect is contingent upon his coming back into it it's a crisis it's
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:42.580]   a cataclysm it's an apocalypse then cometh the end and it will be the end
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.140]   sin and evil will be utterly destroyed the devil and all his agents and his
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:54.700]   cohorts will be cast to everlasting destruction and all who belong to him
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:49:02.180]   all who haven't believed this message concerning the Son of God and having
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:09.020]   purged the universe of sin and evil he will introduce a great renovation there
[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:13.820]   will be a regeneration of the whole universe and cosmos the new heavens and
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:18.140]   the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness and this is the amazing
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:23.780]   thing I we give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:27.540]   always for you since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:30.580]   which you have to all the saints for the hope which is laid up for you in him
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:35.820]   you know says Paul you'll be there with me we'll be together in the glory the
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:42.260]   hope laid up in heaven this new universe this new world this new cosmos this
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:47.460]   perfection no more sorrow no more sighing no more sin no more tears no more
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:57.620]   parting the glory land Emmanuel land and all who believe in the Lord Jesus
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:03.740]   Christ will be in it living in it rejoicing in it glorified themselves
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:09.740]   even their bodies reigning with Christ judging angels judging the world glory
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:20.180]   unmixed full final free everlasting and it'll go on forever and forever we
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:33.340]   shall see God blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God and we
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:40.780]   shall see him the Son of God as he is and we shall be like him and we shall
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:45.060]   enter into that inheritance which we are sharing with him we are children of God
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:51.060]   and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ we'll enter
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:51:01.420]   into the inheritance with him and we'll enjoy it forever and forever that's the
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:07.860]   object of the grace of God that's why the Son of God came from heaven and
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:18.380]   lived and died and rose again it was in order to make it possible for us to
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:26.300]   become inheritors of that glory and to enter into it in this world he gives us
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:37.260]   a hope the hope which is laid up in heaven for us Christ in you the hope of
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:46.860]   glory and a Christian is a man who's concerned about the hope of glory the
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:50.900]   hope which is laid up in him if you've never thought about that I don't care
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:54.980]   what you are I don't get how good you are you're not a Christian you can be

[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:04.640]   may be a great political reformer I don't care what you are if your hope is
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:12.500]   not laid up in heaven if Christ is not in you the hope of glory you just
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:18.460]   haven't got Christianity you've never known what it is that's Christianity

[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:37.340]   Apostle felt when he said in this tabernacle we do groan being burdened

[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:52.860]   sight of God and living in that builder land that glory that baffles the highest
