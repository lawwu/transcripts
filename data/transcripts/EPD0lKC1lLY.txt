[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.680]   We begin another week with a question from a listener named Tom who asks this, "Hello
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.960]   Pastor John, the epistles of Paul seem to be addressed to specific audiences in the
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.320]   cities of Rome and Corinth and Philippi and others."
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.320]   Indeed they are.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.920]   "So how do we know that those epistles now apply to me and to other people today?
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.920]   I know that the epistles are to believers, but I'm confused how that logically includes
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.440]   believers today.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.360]   How does the Bible answer that question?"
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.920]   It's a question that is really worth thinking about.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.720]   We just kind of assume that, and it's good to pause and reflect on why is that?
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.540]   Why do we assume that they're so relevant and valid for us today?
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:01:01.400]   So let me think out loud for a few minutes and give maybe six or seven ideas or reasons
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.840]   from the Scriptures why even the parts of the Bible that are very focused on one particular
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.120]   situation two thousand years ago or more are relevant and are valid for us today.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.840]   Number one, we know that Paul wanted at least one of his letters read elsewhere.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.440]   So he says in Colossians 4:16, "And when this letter has been read among you, have
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.100]   it also read in the church of the Laodiceans."
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.320]   So the very least we can say is, even though there were peculiar relevancies to the church
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.680]   in Colossae, Paul thought the letter would be useful in another place.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.880]   So that's a good pointer that Paul didn't think of his letters as useful only in one
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.180]   place or time.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:08.900]   Number two, not all epistles were designated for only one church, and the fact that they
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:17.360]   were written to whole regions and churches would caution us from thinking that the letters
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.520]   have only tiny, small, particular congregational significance.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.880]   So James, for example, starts, "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus to the
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.360]   twelve tribes of the dispersion."
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.960]   Well, I think that's a code word for Christians all over the Roman Empire in all kinds of
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.680]   situations.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.320]   Or Peter begins like this, 1 Peter, "Peter, an apostle to those who are elect exiles of
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.080]   the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, Bithynia."
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.320]   My, my, my, that's a lot of places and a lot of diversity that this letter is set
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   to.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.400]   So let's be careful that we don't over-particularize the letters of the New Testament.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.360]   Third response, "The apostles knew that the teachings they were giving were not merely
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.920]   their own, but were the words of the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit always knows how to
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.380]   make His words valid and relevant for His people, His people of all time."
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.320]   So Paul says, for example, 1 Corinthians 2.12, "We have received not the Spirit of
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.540]   the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.720]   given to us by God."
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.220]   And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit, interpreting
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.920]   spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.440]   Those who are spiritual would include us, and the Holy Spirit is able to see all of
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.640]   those who will be reading His words and know what to say through the apostle Paul so that
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.320]   they would be useful.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.980]   Number four, the fourth reason for thinking these are valid and relevant, "The teaching
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:14.600]   of the apostles was seen as the foundation of the whole church, universal, not just the
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.680]   foundation of a single local congregation."
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.820]   For example, Ephesians 2.19, "So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.080]   are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.220]   of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Himself being the cornerstone."
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:48.160]   So that verse is teaching that the apostles, that is, in their writing and in their teaching,
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.080]   have become a foundation for the household of God, universal, not just a particular church
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.480]   in Ephesus.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.920]   And so the foundational nature of the apostolic teaching in their own minds is a pointer to
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.000]   the fact that the church of Jesus Christ would rest upon them and find them foundational
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.840]   and useful for their whole existence, the church's whole existence.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.440]   Number five, much of the epistles are instruction about the nature of salvation, the nature
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.120]   of man, the nature of God, and His way of working in the world, and not about a situation
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.760]   in the local church.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.680]   Here's just a few examples.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.360]   First Corinthians 15.3, "I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.000]   that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that He was buried, that
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.920]   He was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures."
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.400]   There's nothing about that sentence that is time-bound or situation-bound.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.000]   It is an explication of the historical reality of the gospel.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.660]   Here's another one, Romans 3.28, "We hold that a person is justified by faith apart
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.000]   from works of law, or is God the God of the Jews only?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Is He not God of the Gentiles also?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.320]   Yes, of the Gentiles also, since God is one who will justify the circumcised by faith
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.440]   and the uncircumcised through faith."
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.320]   That's a statement that is not determined by any particular local situation.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.960]   It's good for all time because it's rooted in the very nature of God.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.760]   One more example, First Corinthians 2.14, "The natural person does not accept the things
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.120]   of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.960]   He's not able to understand them, for they are spiritually discerned."
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.360]   That's a statement about the nature of fallen man that's good for all time.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.040]   So the point there is lots of instruction in the epistles is not related in particular
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.800]   to the situation or the time.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.240]   And here's number six.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.520]   The arguments that are made in the epistles for why we should act a certain way, even
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.440]   if it's in a particular time and place, are arguments that are based on truths that
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.040]   are valid across time.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:16.080]   For example, Ephesians 4.25, "Having put away falsehood, let each of you speak truth
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.280]   with his neighbor."
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.720]   Now should we stop there and say, "Well, maybe that's not true for us today.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.240]   Maybe we can speak lies to each other."
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.800]   He grounds it like this, "For we are members of one another."
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.080]   In other words, he roots the call for truthfulness in a truth that is true for all time.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.560]   In the body of Christ, we are members of one another.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.840]   Or Romans 12.19, "Beloved, never avenge yourselves.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.080]   Leave it to the wrath of God."
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.660]   Now if a person says, "Well, maybe we should avenge ourselves today.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.160]   Maybe that's only relevant for the Romans."
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.160]   No.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.200]   Here's the way he argues, "For it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,' says
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   the Lord."
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.160]   So the nature of the argument is in God, not in the situation.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.680]   Here's another example, 1 Timothy 2.12, "I do not permit a woman to teach or exercise
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.680]   authority over man.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.360]   She is to remain quiet.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.800]   For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.160]   Adam was not deceived, but the woman."
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:22.800]   In other words, the argument for a woman's listening and submitting to the teaching of
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.160]   the men in the church isn't rooted in the local situation.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.920]   It's rooted in creation.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.080]   Or take Philemon.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   Now Philemon is the most personal book in the Bible.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.720]   It is so unbelievably concrete and specific.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:46.280]   And yet, Paul, writing to Philemon to try to get him to take back Onesimus, who had
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:52.360]   been converted under Paul's ministry in prison, he says, "Though I am bold enough in Christ
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:09:00.120]   to command you to do what is required, yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you."
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.200]   Now, in that way of talking, he's showing us something about the nature of love that's
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.840]   not grounded in the situation at all.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:15.200]   It's grounded in the nature of love that prefers to appeal rather than to command.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.640]   And I've got a whole bunch of more illustrations, but that's enough.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.120]   Let me just close like this.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.640]   Number seven, "Would it be like God?"
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.560]   I don't think it would be like our Good Shepherd if he gave a book to his people in the first
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:41.440]   century that was useless to the people that he loves and intends to guide in the later
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440]   centuries.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.280]   It's always good to ask foundational questions like this one and not make assumptions about
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.280]   the relevance of the Bible.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.180]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.680]   This is the purpose of the podcast.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.840]   I mean, taking important topics that are often assumed and then rethinking them.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.640]   And to that end, thank you for the question, Tom.

[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.240]   Well, why is John Pfeiffer so opposed to fun?
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.320]   Does he shudder in the presence of glee?
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.080]   Is he a moody killjoy, a cloudy curmudgeon, a melancholic puddle glum, a wet blanketed
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.360]   downer or just a sore headed codger?
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.840]   We'll find out more tomorrow about John Pfeiffer's beef with fun.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.600]   I'm your host Tony Reike.
