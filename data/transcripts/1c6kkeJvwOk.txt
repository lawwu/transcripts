[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   I hope you had a delightful Christmas weekend experiencing the peace of Christ in your life.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.280]   And we are back to work with a really important question from Josh in South Carolina.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.680]   Pastor John, in your book, God is the Gospel, you make this statement, "The gospel is not
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.600]   a way to get people to heaven.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.520]   It is a way to get people to God."
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.560]   You then close chapter three saying, "If we do not see him and savor him as our greatest
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.080]   fortune, we have not obeyed or believed the gospel."
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.400]   Are you saying that those who acknowledge their need of Christ's propitiation to be
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.600]   justified and stand righteous before God and yet fall short of God being the object of
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.520]   their affection are not effectively justified by the gospel?
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.400]   How would you respond to Josh?
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.040]   Well, I am very, very thankful for this question because I have had others talking to me recently.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.920]   I'm eager to clarify this, if I can.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.680]   I know that the way I often talk about the nature of saving faith troubles some very
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.360]   good people who are faithful to the gospel.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.600]   For example, I say things like, "Faith is being satisfied in all that God is for us
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.320]   in Jesus."
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.000]   I say that all over the place in the book Future Grace, the most prominent place where
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I say it.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.640]   Now, in the places where I have said things like that, and I say them unrepentantly, I
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.440]   try to give many supporting Bible foundations for that definition.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.760]   And we can't go into all those, but let me just mention one because it's going to relate
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.280]   to the answer here.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.000]   Jesus said to them, John 6, 35, "I am the bread of life.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.520]   Whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.040]   So Jesus portrays himself as bread, and by implication water because he refers to thirst.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.400]   And then he gives two parallel statements.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.080]   "Whoever comes to me shall not hunger," and then parallel to that, "Whoever believes
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.200]   in me shall never thirst."
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.400]   And therefore, coming to Jesus so as not to hunger and believing in Jesus so as not to
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.360]   thirst are parallel.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.800]   And I think they are referring to the same reality.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.480]   Jesus is the bread that satisfies the hunger of the soul, and Jesus is the living water
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.560]   that satisfies the thirst of the soul.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.360]   And coming and believing are virtually interchangeable in these parallel statements.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:07.560]   And so coming so as not to hunger and believing so as not to thirst are the same.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.240]   And therefore, it seems to me that Jesus is pressing us to see deeper into what believing
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.720]   really involves.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.880]   Believing is a coming, not geographically, not physically, but a movement of the soul
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.200]   in thirst and in hunger for its deepest needs to be satisfied.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.440]   That is a coming to Jesus for that satisfaction and finding it in him.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.440]   That's what I think that verse teaches about the nature of believing, of faith.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.800]   And I think it's all over the place in the Gospel of John that it means that.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:59.360]   And therefore, I do believe that if we do not see and savor Jesus as the supreme satisfaction
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.700]   of our souls, we don't believe in Jesus in a saving way.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.880]   Not because I'm adding anything to faith, like you got to believe to be justified, then
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.560]   you got to do something else to get to heaven or something like that.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.960]   That's not the point.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.280]   The point is I am pressing into faith in the New Testament.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.160]   I'm pressing into numerous places in the Bible where saving faith is more than knowledge,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:37.040]   more than agreement, and more than trust or receiving of a partial Christ.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.480]   When I say faith is more than the receiving of a partial Christ, I mean faith includes
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.840]   not only receiving Jesus as Savior and receiving Jesus as Lord, but also receiving Jesus for
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.360]   what he really is, namely the supreme treasure of the universe.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.080]   Or if you prefer to stay with the word Savior and Lord, I put it like this.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:12.360]   I mean that faith receives Jesus as a treasured Savior, a treasured Lord.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:20.360]   And if you say that a person can be a Christian, born again, justified, heaven-bound, enjoying
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.440]   eternal life, a person can be a Christian and have a higher treasure than Jesus, I do
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.000]   not know what Bible you are reading.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.320]   Jesus said, Matthew 10, 37, "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.840]   of me.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.660]   Whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:55.520]   Do we think he would say, "Well, it's not okay to treasure mother or father or son or
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.320]   daughter more than me, but it's okay to treasure your job more than me.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.160]   It's okay to treasure your health more than me.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.680]   It's okay to treasure your nation more than me.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.040]   It's okay to treasure your reputation more than me.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.440]   It's okay to treasure your life more than me."
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.760]   No!
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:20.600]   Where Jesus is not treasured above all things, he's not trusted with saving faith.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:30.280]   Now, of course, I am deeply aware, both from the Bible and from John Piper's own experience,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:41.680]   that the trusting and the treasuring of Jesus rise and fall in intensity from day to day.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.840]   Anyone who has read my books, especially the book, When I Don't Desire God, knows I don't
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.800]   have a perfectionist bone in my theological body, because I'd be a goner.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:04.000]   I am a sinner in need of grace every day, including the grace for my imperfect faith
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.880]   and my imperfect treasuring of Jesus as part of that faith.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:19.000]   The issue is—not perfection—the issue is, have I set my face with as much of my
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.600]   heart and as much of my mind and as much of my soul and my strength as I can to treasure
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.960]   God in Christ above all things?
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.540]   And I have more or less success just like believing rises and falls.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:42.000]   The fact that—it's not a criticism of my view to say that treasuring Jesus rises
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.120]   and falls, and therefore you can't equate it with faith.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.200]   Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.400]   Faith rises and falls every day.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.800]   Justifying faith rises and falls every day.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.680]   John wrote, "He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.600]   But to all who received him, who believed on his name, he gave the right to become the
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.620]   children of God."
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.680]   We become children of God through receiving Jesus.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.680]   That is, believing.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.920]   That's what belief is.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   Belief is a receiving.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.280]   It's a reception.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:28.280]   And I am simply pressing the issue that comes out over and over again in the Bible, that
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:35.600]   to receive him as a forgiver of sins, to receive him as a guilt remover, to receive him as
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:45.040]   a door out of hell, to receive him as a healer of the body, and not to receive him as a treasure
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.520]   to satisfy the soul, is not to believe on Jesus.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:59.600]   Jesus is not honored, and the Father is not glorified, where he is welcomed only for his
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.800]   gifts and not for himself.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:10.020]   So to answer Josh's question more directly, let me point to something strange in the way
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.680]   he worded his question.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:22.120]   He says, "Are you saying that those who acknowledge their need of Christ's propitiation to be
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:30.480]   justified and stand righteous before God, yet fall short of God being the object of
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.400]   their affection, are not effectively justified?"
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.920]   Indeed, I am.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.160]   But look what he left out.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.480]   Did you notice he never mentioned faith?
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.640]   Faith is missing from that.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   I'm going to read it again just so you see it.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:52.040]   "Are you saying that those who acknowledge their need of Christ's propitiation to be
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:58.640]   justified and," and now right here, "you need to hear and receive him by faith," that should
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.440]   be there because that's how you're justified.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.560]   Faith is how you're justified, not just seeing your need.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.000]   You're not justified by seeing your need.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   You're justified by seeing your need and then trusting him, receiving him as all you need,
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.960]   and that's totally missing, and so I don't know quite how to respond when it's totally
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.760]   missing, so I'm going to stick it in.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.000]   I'm going to say, here's the way his question, I think he really meant it.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.240]   I think this was an oversight.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.280]   "Are you saying that a person can acknowledge their need of Christ's propitiation to be
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:37.760]   justified and receive him by faith and thus stand righteous before God?"
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:45.200]   Are you saying that that can happen and a person not be satisfied in God or find God
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.720]   as his supreme joy and still be justified?
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.380]   And my answer is that is an impossible situation.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:11:03.720]   It cannot happen because receiving Jesus by faith is a receiving of Jesus, which includes
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.960]   a receiving of all that God is for us in Jesus, namely, he is our supreme treasure, as is
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.840]   writ large all over the Bible.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.800]   I'm not adding anything to faith.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.480]   I am trying to define faith biblically so that it can have a transforming effect upon
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.760]   the world which it so desperately needs right now.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.120]   And there is more there in the Bible about the nature of faith than is often seen.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.600]   Exactly.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.000]   This is exactly what we are all about at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.040]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   That's our motto.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.120]   And if all of this is new to you, that faith in Christ is treasuring Christ as your supreme
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.360]   treasure, I would invite you to take some time this week, even today, to get familiar
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.080]   with DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.840]   We have a lot of content that centers on this crucial theme.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.240]   And if your heart resonates with the message of what Pastor John just described, we want
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.840]   to invite you to become partners with us in our work.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.400]   First, we need your prayers.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.680]   There's a lot of work to be done, and we feel needy for God's grace every day.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.400]   And of course, if you're not, please consider becoming a financial partner as well.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.360]   You can do that by going to DesiringGod.org and look for the "Donate" button at the

[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.160]   And we are deeply grateful to God for you and to the many supporters that we have around
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   the world.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160]   Thank you.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
