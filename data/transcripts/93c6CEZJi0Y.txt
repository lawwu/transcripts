[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Once more, I deem it to be wise to remind you of the exact point at which we have arrived
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.160]   in our consideration of these biblical doctrines.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.800]   Having seen man in his fallen condition and his hopelessness, we have gone on to consider
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.020]   the great biblical doctrine of redemption and of salvation.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.680]   And having considered together the covenant of grace and the covenant of redemption, we
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.920]   have found that it always, everywhere, points to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.200]   He is the great central figure and person of the Bible, and there is no salvation apart
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.880]   from him.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.500]   So the Bible always points us to him as being absolutely vital and essential to our whole
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.480]   position, so that we have started considering together the great biblical doctrine of the
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.540]   person and work of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.940]   And at the moment we are considering the doctrine of the person.
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.780]   We shall not be able to get beyond that before we come to the end of this session next Friday
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.540]   evening.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.380]   Now in considering the doctrine of his person, we are at once confronted by the doctrine
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:33.980]   of the incarnation, the doctrine which tells us that the eternal Son of God became flesh
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.060]   and came into this world in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.900]   And we have defined together what exactly the doctrine of the incarnation does say and
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.660]   what it does not say.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.740]   But there it is in its essence that the eternal second person in the blessed Trinity came
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.780]   into this world and took into him human nature and appeared as a man amongst men.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.860]   And that, of course, in turn then led us to consider the way in which that happened, how
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.540]   he came into this world.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.660]   And there, of course, we were considering together the doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.220]   And that was the thing which occupied most of our time last Friday evening.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:28.180]   Very well then, there we were looking at this babe in Bethlehem of whom we assert that he
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.500]   is God the eternal Son.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.140]   Now that obviously means that we must look a little more closely together at what the
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.580]   Bible tells us about this person who there came into the world as a babe and grew into
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.460]   a boy and developed into manhood and set out in his public ministry.
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.580]   It is of vital importance that we should be clear with regard to the doctrine concerning
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.580]   his person.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.020]   We have already adduced evidence to show the importance of that.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.620]   So now, before we make any attempt really to understand what the Bible does teach about
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.100]   the mystery of his person, we must look at the evidence with which it presents us in
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.720]   order that we may arrive at an adequate doctrine of his person.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.220]   And we find at once that there are two main things which the Bible tells us about his
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.060]   person.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.260]   The first is, it makes many claims to the effect that he is divine.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.300]   It asserts and teaches his divinity, or if you like, still more accurately, his deity,
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.420]   the divinity of the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.740]   Now I want to present this evidence to you.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.260]   It is voluminous and it could occupy a great deal of time.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.140]   I am afraid, therefore, you will have to forgive me if I give you more or less hurried headings
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.920]   this evening.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.860]   You can look at the evidence and check the evidence and consider the evidence for yourselves
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.860]   at leisure.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.980]   I am simply anxious to classify it in order to make your study a little more easy.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.620]   Now the first evidence is this.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.620]   There are certain divine names which are ascribed to him, divine names.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.540]   Now there are altogether some sixteen names ascribed to him, each of which clearly implies
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.180]   his deity.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.180]   Let me mention some of them to you.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.300]   He is described as the son of God forty times, son of God.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.780]   He is referred to as his son, God's son.
[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.440]   God refers to him audibly as my son.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.220]   So there is that title, son, son of God, in various forms.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.700]   Then he is also referred to as the only begotten son of God, five times.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.380]   You get it in John 1.18, which we read together just now, but there are many others.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.860]   A notable one, of course, is the parable of the wicked husbandmen.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:25.780]   When God says, "They will reverence my son," the teaching there is perfectly clear, words
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.980]   uttered by our Lord himself.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.980]   Then he is described as the first and the last.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.540]   You will find that in Revelation 1.17.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:44.020]   He is described as the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, again in terms
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.180]   of deity, obviously.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.740]   There is nothing before the beginning, there is nothing after the end.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.860]   Then you remember that Peter preaching in Jerusalem, you will find it recorded in Acts
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.500]   3.14, refers to him as the Holy One.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.460]   But he denied the Holy One and the just, again in terms of deity.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:16.500]   Then take the great term, "the Lord," which is used of him and ascribed to him several
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.700]   hundred times in the New Testament.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:27.140]   Now that word is the word which is equivalent to the Old Testament term, "Jehovah," which
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.380]   we have already considered together.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:38.820]   The Lord stands for and represents Jehovah, one of the highest titles ascribed to God.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.740]   Then another term used of him is "the Lord of glory."
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.340]   You will find that in 1 Corinthians 2.8.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.900]   Had they known him, says Paul, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory—a most
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.380]   exalted term.
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.580]   Then he is actually referred to as God.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.660]   Thomas says, "My Lord and my God."
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.380]   He is also described, you remember, we saw last week, as Immanuel, God with us.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:14.540]   You will find that in the first chapter of Matthew, Immanuel, God with us.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:21.020]   Then there is a most remarkable statement in Titus 2.13, where he is referred to as
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:29.980]   our great God and Savior, our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:37.500]   And again another equally remarkable ascription of titles to him is found in Romans 9.5, where
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:44.900]   he is described as God blessed forever, whose are the fathers and of whom, as concerning
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:51.780]   the flesh, Christ came, who is overall God blessed forever.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.860]   Now there you have a number of names which are ascribed to him, all of which are divine
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.340]   names.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:09.660]   But secondly, the Bible ascribes and attributes to him divine attributes, certain divine attributes.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.420]   You remember when we were dealing with the doctrine of God, we were considering the divine
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.420]   attributes.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.960]   Well, now you will find that those very attributes are also ascribed to our Lord.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:27.640]   For instance, omnipotence, Hebrews 1.3 says that he upholds all things by the word of
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.120]   his power.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.800]   No stronger statement than that is possible.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.720]   And that all things are subject to him.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.600]   I am simply giving you one reference; there are others which you can find for yourselves.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.800]   Then omniscience is attributed to him.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.160]   In Matthew 11.27 you will read this, "No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; and no
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.120]   man knoweth the Father, but the Son.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.000]   And they to whomsoever the Son chooseth to reveal him."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.560]   There is a claim again of omniscience.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:10.240]   And you will find in John 2.23-25 the same claim, that he knew what was in men.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.560]   And it was not necessary that anybody should tell him what was in men, for he knew what
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.560]   was in men, omniscience.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.640]   Then in a very extraordinary way, omnipresence is attributed to him.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.920]   In Matthew 18.20 you will read this, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name,
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.440]   there am I."
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:42.080]   In Matthew 28.20 he says, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end."
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.400]   And in John 3.13 there is a very striking statement, "No man hath ascended up into
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:56.160]   heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven."
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.640]   He says that while he is on earth, the Son of man who is in heaven.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:10.440]   And indeed we read of him, according to the Apostle Paul, "that he filleth all in all."
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.680]   Again a comprehensive statement.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.080]   Then another divine attribute is his eternity, "In the beginning was the world."
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.400]   That is an assertion of his eternity.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.040]   In the same way, we have statements about his immutability, he cannot change.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:37.920]   Hebrews 13.8 tells us, "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever."
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.800]   Immutability, another attribute of God.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.920]   Then of course the Bible asserts his pre-existence.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.840]   Colossians 1.17 tells us, "He is before all things and by him all things consist."
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.540]   In John 17.5 he prays that the Father will restore to him the glory that he had with
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:05.480]   him from the beginning, his pre-existence.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.680]   And again you remember in the great passage in Philippians 2.6, which we hope to consider
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:20.920]   next Friday evening, Paul there asserts that he was in the form of God before his incarnation.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.080]   And then we have another comprehensive statement to wind it all up where Paul tells us that
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.360]   "All the fullness of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily."
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.040]   In the second chapter of the epistle to the Colossians, "All the fullness of the Godhead
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.920]   dwelleth in him bodily."
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:49.340]   Thirdly, we go on to consider certain divine offices which he is said to hold and to fill.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.600]   First of all, creation.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:12:00.480]   John 1.3, "All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   made."
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   Creation.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:11.800]   You get the same thing repeated in Colossians 1.16, and again in the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.640]   But we are also told that he preserves everything also.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:21.440]   Hebrews 1.3 again, "upholding all things by the word of his power."
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.680]   All things are upheld by him.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:29.000]   And in Colossians again, in the first chapter, you find that all things consist in him and
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   by him.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.200]   So, my dear, preservation.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.120]   Then you notice that he does not hesitate to claim the power of forgiveness of sins.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:49.200]   In Mark 2.5-10, he says to a certain man, "Thy sins be forgiven thee."
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.660]   He claims that power.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.360]   He also claims power to raise the dead.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.000]   You will find that mentioned several times in the sixth chapter of the gospel, according
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.880]   to St. John, verses 39-44, "I will raise him up," he says, "at the last day."
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.880]   He has power to raise the dead.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:16.440]   The apostle Paul claims for him in Philippians 3.21 that he also will have power to transform
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440]   our bodies.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.780]   "Who shall change this our vile body, or this our body of our humiliation, and fashion
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.800]   it like unto his glorious power, according to that mighty power whereby he is able to
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.400]   subdue even all things unto himself."
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.360]   He can transform our bodies.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.320]   Judgment is committed to him.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.400]   Read John 5.22-23, "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   the Son."
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.120]   Again, in Acts 17, Paul makes that claim.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:56.760]   You get it again in 2 Timothy 4.1, "Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   dead."
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.880]   So, the power of judgment is given to him.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:10.020]   And also the power of bestowing eternal life, John 10.28, "And I give unto them eternal
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.400]   life."
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:17.920]   John 17.2, the same thing, "That he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   given him."
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.640]   Very well, there are certain great claims.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.480]   But now the fourth bit of evidence is this.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:35.800]   Claims are to be found in the Old Testament, which are made distinctly of Jehovah, but
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.760]   which in the New Testament are ascribed to the Lord Jesus Christ and are definitions
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760]   of him.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.800]   Now, I am not going to give you the words, but I will give you the texts.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   John 1.2, 24-27, look for it in Hebrews 1.10-12.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:09.480]   Then Isaiah 40.3-4, and then turn to Matthew 3.3 and Luke 1.68-69.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:17.400]   Then Isaiah 6.1, 3 and 10, and John 12.37 and 38.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.680]   These are parallels.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:29.960]   Then the last is Isaiah 8.13 and 14, and 1 Peter 2.7 and 8.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.200]   Now we can sum this up for you like this, by putting it in this form.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:40.440]   The term "Lord" is always used in the Old Testament of God, except when the context
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.480]   makes it perfectly clear that it is used of a man in the sense of "Sir," as we address
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.360]   a man as "Sir."
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.120]   Sometimes the title "Lord" is used like that, but whenever it is used like that, the
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.320]   context will always make it clear.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.560]   Apart from that, the term "Lord" in the Old Testament always refers to God.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.800]   And in exactly the same way, we can say that when the term "Lord" is used in the New
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   Testament, again when the context does not make it quite plain that it is something else,
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.520]   it is always used of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:22.480]   So that we have this tremendous statement that these specific terms, which are used
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:29.400]   directly of Jehovah, are indeed used of the Lord Jesus Christ also.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:36.520]   Then the fifth bit of evidence is this, to note the way in which the names of God the
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:42.240]   Father and Jesus Christ the Son are coupled together.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.400]   There are several examples of this.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.920]   Matthew 28.19, "Go ye therefore, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.280]   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.320]   Romans 1.7, "God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.840]   2 Corinthians 13.14, "The so-called apostolic benediction, the grace of the Lord Jesus
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:12.000]   Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit."
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.280]   1 Thessalonians 3.18, "Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.560]   direct our thoughts unto you," and so on.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.600]   And you find it indeed in the epistle of James, the first chapter and the first verse.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:36.480]   James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.400]   That brings us to the sixth bit of evidence.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.840]   That divine worship is ascribed to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.720]   He accepted such worship of men when he was here on earth.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:57.640]   You will find that in Matthew 28.9 and in Luke 24.52.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:05.680]   But you get it also by way of exhortation, 1 Corinthians 1 and 2.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:12.080]   Paul refers to all who in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.000]   That is worship.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   In 2 Corinthians 12.8 and 9, he tells us, "I besought the Lord for this thing thrice,"
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.480]   the Lord Jesus Christ, quite clear from the context.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.520]   We read of Stephen as he was being stoned in the seventh chapter of Acts, verse 59.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:40.600]   They stoned Stephen, calling upon the Lord and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.520]   Indeed our Lord himself has already prepared us for all this in John 5.23, when he says
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.840]   that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:58.720]   "He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father that has sent him."
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   There are other instances also of worship ascribed to him and the claim in Philippians
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:11.560]   2.10 that a time is coming when at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of things in
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.080]   heaven and things on earth, and things under the earth.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.360]   That brings me to my last bit of evidence, the seventh bit of evidence, which is his
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:28.160]   own self-consciousness and his own specific claims to deity.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.040]   I am simply picking out some of them, which I regard as most important.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.200]   There are many others, of course.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.240]   The first is found in the second chapter of Luke's Gospel, in the incident described
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.440]   in verses 41 to 52.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:50.360]   You remember how he said that he must be about his father's business, or about the things
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.320]   of my father, if you like.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.720]   A most remarkable claim made by him when he was but a boy twelve years old.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.120]   My father's business.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.760]   You get, of course, the same thing exactly at his baptism.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.640]   You remember when he went to John to be baptised of him, John remonstrated with him and said,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.760]   "I ought to be baptised of thee."
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.920]   Now our Lord does not reject that statement; he accepts it.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.200]   He simply says, "Suffer it to be so now."
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.640]   He does not reject John's statement; in other words, he accepts it and thereby acknowledges
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.840]   his superiority to John.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.120]   In this connection we notice also the voice from heaven, of course, that came and attested
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.960]   as to his person and to his deity.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.800]   And then you get much the same kind of thing in the accounts of his temptation.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.680]   The devil tempted him like this each time, "If thou be the Son of God."
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.740]   He never said that he wasn't.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.920]   He accepts the devil's statement and proves to him that he is the Son of God.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:02.720]   And by accepting the statement, he thus asserts and makes a claim of his own deity.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.480]   And he does so, of course, in many other ways.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.940]   In the calling of the Twelve, for instance, he clearly is asserting it.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:16.000]   In giving power unto them, giving them the message, giving them the power to cast out
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.400]   devils, he again, of course, is claiming for himself this uniqueness.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:32.480]   And you also get it in the fact that he tells them to cast out devils in his name, specifically.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:38.240]   He gives them that injunction.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:47.360]   And so on, we find that he makes this unique claim for himself.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.720]   In the Sermon on the Mount, he does it, of course, by contrasting what they had heard
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.400]   from them of old times, but what he says, by way of contrast.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.880]   And then the specific claim in the eighth chapter of John's Gospel, before Abraham,
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.480]   was, "I am."
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.520]   And once more, I would refer you to that statement in Matthew 11, verse 27, where he claims this
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.400]   unique knowledge of the Father.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.880]   But in many ways, of course, the most important section of Scripture under this heading is
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.960]   to be found in the Gospel according to St. John, chapters 14 to 17.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.320]   And as you study them at your leisure, keep an eye out for this particular aspect of the
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:42.040]   matter, his claim and his self-consciousness of his unique deity.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.640]   And then finally, to round it off, you can give it a separate heading if you like or
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640]   not.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   We have already dealt with it.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.400]   The virgin birth, of course, again, and everything that the Scriptures teach us about the virgin
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:59.040]   birth, are again a form of the claim of his deity.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:05.640]   And finally, to cover it all and to bring it all to its climax, as the Apostle Paul
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:13.720]   teaches us in Romans 1, 4, ultimately what proves and declares him to be the Son of God
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.640]   is the resurrection from the dead.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.960]   Well, now, there we have looked in general at this great evidence, which, as I have said,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   is voluminous and almost exhaustless.
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.200]   But we have taken a kind of synoptic view of it, and there are the main headings into
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.720]   which it can be classified.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:39.760]   Thus, the Scriptures claim for him his divinity or his unique deity.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.880]   But of course, I must hurry on to say, as the second great claim, that the Scriptures
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:51.940]   also equally definitely teach us his humanity, his deity and his humanity.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.440]   And we cannot arrive at an adequate doctrine of the person without again looking at the
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.280]   evidence carefully which is provided in the Scriptures for his humanity.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:10.920]   Now, the first bit of evidence here we have already considered—the virgin birth again,
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.640]   and all the arguments that we considered in connection with his virgin birth.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:23.880]   All those can establish the fact of his humanity, and our arguments about the precise nature
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.400]   of the doctrine of the Incarnation, that it was not a phantom body and so on, but that
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:36.080]   he really did take on him human nature, and that he was truly the son of the Virgin Mary,
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.800]   that it was not an appearance but that it was a fact.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.120]   Well, there is our first bit of evidence.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.920]   The second, again, is provided by names.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.520]   Take for instance what you read in 1 Timothy 2.5.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:25:00.640]   There is but one God and one mediator between God and men, the man, Christ Jesus.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.800]   He is described as the man.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.400]   And you notice you cannot have read the Scriptures, the Gospels, without noticing the frequency
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.920]   with which the term "the Son of Man" is used about him.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.560]   It is used over eighty times.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:24.440]   Now, the Son of Man, of course, is a very special term, and it has a very special significance.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.760]   I am simply concerned to remind you and to emphasize at this point that he is described
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:37.640]   as the Son of Man; that clearly is an indication of his humanity, as well as this peculiar
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.440]   title which is involved in the designation.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.760]   Then the third bit of evidence is that the Scriptures make it abundantly plain and clear
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:56.600]   that he had a typical human physical nature.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:03.460]   Take that statement in John 1.14, "The Word was made flesh" or "became flesh."
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:09.880]   Take again the statements we considered last week in Hebrews 2, particularly verse 14,
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.640]   where we are told that because the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he also
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.040]   took likewise of the same.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   Then another very striking bit of evidence under this heading is this, that he obviously
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.200]   looked like a man.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.000]   Not only that, we have evidence to prove that he looked like a typical Jew.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.240]   Do you remember what we are told of the incident of the woman of Samaria meeting our Lord at
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.840]   the well?
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.080]   She expressed her astonishment that he should speak to her.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.020]   "How is it," she said, "that thou, being a Jew, should speak unto me that I am a woman
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.160]   of Samaria?"
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.800]   She had no idea who he was.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.640]   But she looked at him when he spoke to her, and she at once recognized that he was a Jew.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:06.040]   So that I say that he not only looked like a man and had an ordinary human physical frame,
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:14.480]   he even appeared as a Jew in particular.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.520]   Then the next bit of evidence still under the same heading of his human physical frame
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:28.440]   is this, that the Scriptures teach us that he still had this human body even after his
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.500]   resurrection.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:38.240]   Do you remember when he appeared to the disciples when Thomas was present in the room?
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.320]   And he is anxious to prove to Thomas that he is the same person.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.600]   "Reach hither thy hand," he said, "and put thy finger into my side, and into the marks
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.600]   of the nail prints."
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:59.080]   Do we find in Luke 24, verse 39, again he says to these disciples that he is not a spirit,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:05.940]   because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as they see that he has.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.160]   So he still has a true human body even after the resurrection.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.240]   Indeed, I can go beyond that.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.960]   There is evidence in the Scripture to teach us that he still has his human body even in
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.640]   glory.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:32.480]   In Acts 7, 55 and 56, we are told that Stephen saw the Son of Man in the glory, and he saw
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.540]   him as the Son of Man.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:41.000]   He is still the Son of Man and recognizable as such.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.240]   And again I would refer you to the statement of Paul in Philippians 3.20, which I quoted
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.000]   to you just now, but now I must quote it putting a different emphasis.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.760]   "He shall change this our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.760]   body."
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.760]   His glorious body.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.880]   It is still the same body glorified.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:16.400]   So he still has this human body there in the glory, a most remarkable statement and a striking
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.160]   bit of evidence.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:26.120]   Now that brings us to the fourth general evidence of his humanity, which is this, that he was
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:32.080]   subject to growth and to development like all of us.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:40.000]   Luke 2.40, "And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.560]   the grace of God was upon him."
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:51.360]   In the same chapter, Luke 2.52, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.200]   with God and men."
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:01.800]   Hebrews 2.10, "For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.880]   in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.640]   suffering."
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.720]   The suggestion of growth and of development.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:22.640]   And still more specifically, in Hebrews 5.8, "Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.400]   by the things which he suffered."
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.640]   Growth and development.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:38.020]   The fifth evidence of his humanity is that he was clearly, here on earth, subject to
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:42.160]   certain limitations in his knowledge.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   Limitations of knowledge.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:52.040]   Here is an instance in Mark 11, verse 13, the incident of the barren fig tree.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:56.240]   We are told that our Lord came to it expecting to receive fruit on it.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.320]   He did not know that it had not got fruit on it.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:08.360]   In Mark 13, verse 32, we read these most important and momentous words.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:16.320]   Mark 13, verse 32, "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.800]   are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:29.020]   He there says specifically that he does not know this day which is coming, the precise
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.280]   time of the day.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:37.560]   Not only do the angels not know it, even he does not know it, but the Father.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:43.000]   Now we shall try next Friday evening to consider the significance of these statements and to
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.920]   reconcile the two aspects together when we come to the actual doctrine itself.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:53.720]   I am simply providing you now with the evidence, the material out of which the doctrine is
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.200]   formed.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:03.080]   So that brings me to proof number six, which is that he was clearly subject to physical
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.580]   limitations.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.320]   Subject to physical limitations.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:14.440]   Again in John 4, the incident of the woman of Samaria, we are told that he was weary.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.480]   He sat down by the side of the well because he was physically tired and did not go with
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.160]   the disciples to buy provisions.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.680]   Many times we read of him as asleep in the boat on the sea.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.240]   He was sleeping in the stern of the vessel.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.400]   He slept.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.920]   We are told he was hungry.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:40.840]   The incident of the barren fig tree again, going in the morning to Jerusalem, you remember.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.840]   He felt hungry.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.880]   He was unhungry.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.260]   He thirsted.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:52.880]   We are told that he said, "I thirst upon the cross."
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.160]   He endured physical agony.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:03.360]   He was in an agony in the garden of Gethsemane, and he was there sweating great drops of blood.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:10.880]   And finally, of course, and conclusive, and most important of all, he actually literally
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.600]   died.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.160]   He died.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:24.560]   And his death is the ultimate final proof of his humanity, this physical limitation.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:31.320]   That brings us then to the seventh evidence, which is that he was tempted.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.300]   We get this in the second chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, in addition to the accounts
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:42.280]   of the temptation in the Gospels, and in Hebrews 4.15, it is put specifically like this, that
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:50.740]   he was tempted in all points, like as we are, yet without sin.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:57.400]   The Holy Scriptures say that he was tempted in all points, like as we are.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.600]   Proof number eight is this, proof number eight is that he obviously had need of prayer.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.720]   Now, here is a great theme.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.760]   Keep your eye on the frequency with which our Lord prayed, and ask yourself the question,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.760]   "Why?"
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.760]   Why did he pray all night before he chose his disciples?
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:22.800]   He constantly was engaging in prayer, and as he comes to face the end, he goes into
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:28.360]   that garden to pray, and asks these men to pray with him and for him.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:34.860]   The need of prayer is an absolute proof of his true humanity.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:39.240]   And then you can look at it like this, if you like, as the ninth proof, that he was
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.080]   clearly given power by the Holy Ghost.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:48.120]   Though he is the eternal Son of God, he needed the power, and he was given the power by the
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   Holy Ghost.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.560]   This is Peter, Acts 10.38, "How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.280]   with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil,
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.040]   for God was with him."
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.040]   God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with power, and that, of course, is the significance
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.960]   partly of his baptism and of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon him, and the statement
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.720]   of John in the third chapter of his Gospel, that "God giveth not the Spirit by measure
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.920]   unto him; he hath it in its fulness."
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.760]   Evidence number ten is that he refers to God as his God.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.240]   John 20.17, "Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto my
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.440]   Father.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:39.040]   But go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.000]   to my God and your God."
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.720]   "My God," he says.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:51.200]   But you see there is a great comprehensive claim again, you can make this the eleventh,
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.560]   that he really was human in all things.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:03.820]   This is Hebrews 2.17, a very crucial statement, "Wherefore, it behoved him in all things,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:10.040]   in all things, to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:16.680]   priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people."
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.760]   I shall have to use that verse again next Friday, God willing.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.760]   I am simply asserting now that it claims that he was made like unto his brethren in all
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   things.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.440]   Remember, always sin apart, sin accepted.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.680]   But in body and in soul and in spirit, he is human.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.240]   He said, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful."
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:46.640]   At the end, he said, "Into thy hands I commend my spirit."
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:53.880]   So he is truly human, body, soul, and spirit, in every respect.
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:37:03.600]   And yet finally, of course, we must emphasize this, that the Scriptures also remind us everywhere
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:10.200]   that though he was truly human, he was also sinless.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.480]   He was without sin.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:18.920]   Now, last week we saw that the angel already told Mary about this.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:24.800]   In Luke 1.35, he says, "The holy thing that shall be born of thee."
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.840]   That is the first assertion of his sinlessness.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.040]   But you remember our Lord challenged people to convict him of sin.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:42.120]   John 8.46, "Which of you," he says, "convinceth me of sin?"
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.480]   And then let us consider some of the great claims that are put forward by him in the
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.440]   epistles.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:56.680]   The classical statement of Paul in 2 Corinthians 5.21, "God hath made him to be sin for us.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:05.800]   Who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him?"
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.080]   And again, the statement in Hebrews 4.15, which I have already quoted, "Tempted in
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:17.760]   all points, like as we are, sin apart, sin accepted, yet without sin."
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:26.200]   Hebrews 9.14, we are told that, "He offered himself without spot unto God."
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.840]   No blemish, no spot, no sin.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:34.320]   A perfect sin offering, fulfilling the Old Testament type.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:42.640]   1 Peter 2.22, we find Peter saying of him, "Who did no sin, neither was guile found
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.120]   in his mouth."
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.080]   He did no sin.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.560]   They assert and claim his sinlessness.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:39:01.600]   And 1 John 3.5 asserts and claims exactly the same, "And in him is no sin."
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:08.580]   Now, there are other statements which are careful to tell us, and you notice the importance
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:14.400]   of believing in the full inspiration of the Scriptures and the importance of every word.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.360]   Paul goes out of his way to say that he came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.840]   He did not come in sinful flesh, he was in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:32.040]   Now, we can put it perhaps best like this, by saying that the Scriptures claim that he
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.320]   is truly human, but they never say that he was carnal.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   And this is the most important point, because carnality is not an essential part of humanity.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:52.680]   Adam, as he was created perfect at the beginning, was truly human, but he was not carnal.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.840]   Carnality is the result of sin.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.960]   And the Scriptures therefore never say that Christ was carnal, but they do assert that
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.160]   he was truly human.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.720]   And here again we see the importance of taking our doctrines in their right chronological
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:14.640]   and logical sequence, because we see that he was given this human nature, he took unto
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:20.680]   him this human nature from Mary as the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit upon her.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.080]   It is truly human, but it is free from sin.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.380]   In other words, it is not carnal.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:37.140]   And I take it that no one is in any difficulty about the fact that he was subject to temptation,
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:44.300]   because the fact that he was subject to temptation does not imply any defect in him whatsoever.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.860]   Of course, he could not have been subject to temptation if he had not become human.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.300]   If he hadn't taken human nature unto himself, he could not have been tempted, for God neither
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.540]   tempteth any man, says James, neither can be tempted.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.420]   God cannot be tempted.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:07.220]   So that the fact that he was tempted proves that he was truly human, that his human nature
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:13.180]   was truly human nature.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:19.860]   So we assert about him that he was subject to temptation, but was at the same time sinless.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:27.220]   And indeed we can go further, and we can say that he was not even subject to fall.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.900]   You remember the famous statement which I quoted once when we were dealing with this
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:36.380]   whole subject of sin.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:41.860]   It was not merely the case that it was possible for him not to sin.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.360]   It was not possible for him to sin.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.020]   And that is the essential difference between him and Adam.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:56.460]   That is the difference between the first Adam and the second Adam.
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:02.460]   The first Adam was perfect, he had not sinned, but sin was possible.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:09.860]   It was possible for Adam not to sin, but you could never say of Adam that it was not possible
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.220]   for him to sin.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.900]   Is that clear?
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:21.180]   It was possible for Adam not to sin, but we cannot say of Adam that it was not possible
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.500]   for him to sin, because he did sin.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:32.300]   But of the Son of God, we say this, that not only was it possible for him not to sin, it
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:38.980]   was not possible for him to sin, because he is the Son of God.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:45.380]   He is God-man, divine and human, and not only human but also divine.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:50.020]   But still, because human, subject to temptation.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.140]   And the devil did tempt him.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:59.380]   And thus, we see the importance of asserting at one and the same time the doctrine of his
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:08.020]   true humanity, and yet the doctrine of his complete sinlessness, his entire, utter, absolute
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.900]   freedom from sin.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:18.700]   In other words, it is not essential to temptation that there should be anything sinful in the
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.180]   one who is tempted.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:27.460]   Sin can be purely external, and the fact that it is purely external does not in any sense
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.860]   mean that it is no longer temptation.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:35.820]   The devil tempted him with all his might in a way that nobody else has ever been tempted.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.340]   It was a real temptation.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:47.060]   But he, at the same time, was entirely free from sin, and it was not possible that he
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.060]   could or should fall.
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:58.020]   God has sent him to be the Savior, and God sending him, there cannot be and there was
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.020]   no failure.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:05.540]   Well, very well, there we have looked in general at the evidence for his divinity and his humanity.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:14.660]   I hope, as I say, next Friday night to go on and to show you how these two great statements
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.700]   must be brought together.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:22.620]   And as we do so, we shall start by showing that this person, of whom it is claimed that
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:28.580]   he is divine and human, that he is God the Son, nevertheless subordinated himself to
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.260]   the Father.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:35.320]   And then, with this complete evidence, we shall consider what the Scripture tells us
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:44.740]   about the actual character of his person, the nature of this person who is divine and
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.220]   human.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:52.700]   And our attempt, in the light of the teaching of the Scripture, to hold those two statements
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.620]   together at one and the same time.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.340]   Let us pray.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:07.580]   Our Heavenly Father, we do thank Thee again for Thy Word and for this amazing teaching.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:14.420]   Oh, how we thank Thee that Thou hast not left us merely with the record, the tradition,
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:19.780]   the oral statement, that Jesus of Nazareth was Thy Son.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:26.340]   We thank Thee for the profusion of evidence, for all this mass of evidence that Thou hast
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:33.100]   given us, so that we may always know that we have not believed cunningly devised fables
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.500]   when we believe about His coming.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:42.780]   Oh, God, we thank Thee for this loving condescension, for the way that Thou hast stooped to our
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:50.260]   weakness, our ignorance, and our frailty, and has given us this Thy great Word with
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.820]   all these infallible proofs.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:46:00.180]   Oh, God, make us wise unto them, give us understanding of them, lead us into them and into their
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:08.060]   mystery and their marvel, in order that we may praise Thy Name and glory in Him, the
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:16.740]   Lord of glory, the Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour, our Redeemer, and our Lord.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.340]   Hear us, O Lord, in His most holy Name.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:29.140]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:35.900]   fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.060]   and evermore.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.620]   Amen.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.540]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
