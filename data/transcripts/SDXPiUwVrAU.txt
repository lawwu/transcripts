[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   As we come to the teaching of the Word of God this morning, obviously we are talking
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.360]   about the resurrection of our Lord.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.200]   But I want to direct our attention to the great reality of the fact that most people
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.120]   don't understand that everybody who has ever lived and died will rise again.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.720]   That's right, everyone.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:33.400]   There will be a resurrection of every single person who has ever lived and died.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.560]   Wherever their bodies were laid, to whatever degree of corruption they were then subjected
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.300]   will have nothing to do with God's ability to raise them in a new body fit for their
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.740]   eternal dwelling.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.340]   Everyone lives forever.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.340]   People who...
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.340]   .
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:02.080]   think that death is sleep and they go out of existence are mistaken.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.320]   They will go into an eternal existence with all their faculties heightened and intensified
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.880]   to a degree that's incomprehensible to them.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.180]   They will also be raised in a body that is fit for their dwelling place, either in heaven
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.360]   or in hell.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.740]   A body suited to eternal blessing and service to God, or a body suited to eternal punishment
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.320]   and suffering.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.680]   But everybody will rise.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.860]   People who assume in taking their life they have escaped have only ushered themselves
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.920]   into the reality of the next and eternal world.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.360]   Back in the book of Job, which was a book written in the early 20th century, the book
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.220]   written in the patriarchal period back in the time of Genesis, the question is posed:
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.420]   "Shall a man live again, or is there life after death?"
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:11.940]   And the answer comes in the 19th chapter of Job where Job says this: "After my skin is
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.740]   destroyed," - in other words, after his body has decayed - "yet in my flesh I will live."
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.740]   Now, this is the question that comes to mind.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.740]   Is it a life after death?
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:32.420]   "I will see God, whom I will see for myself, and my eye will behold, and not another.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.740]   My heart faints within me."
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.560]   Asking the question, "Will a man live again?"
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.420]   Job answers the question, "Yes, he will live again.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.120]   His flesh is corrupted, but yet in a new kind of flesh he will see God."
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.500]   And that's enough to make his heart faint.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:07.640]   Every human being who dies will be raised to see God, every person who's ever lived.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.980]   There is no escape.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.520]   Once you're born, you're forever.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.000]   Now I want you to turn to John, chapter 5.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.120]   And I want to offer you a little bit of a lesson.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120]   I want you to turn to John, chapter 5.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.520]   I want to offer this very, very profound text to you to help you understand what I've
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.240]   just said.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.120]   The resurrection is the subject of this passage.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.560]   The chapter begins with Jesus healing a man at the Pool of Bethesda, a man who had been
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.120]   in some form of disability for 38 years.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120]   And he had been in a very difficult situation.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.480]   He had believed a kind of superstition that if he could get into the water first when
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.880]   the angel stirred the water, as the superstition might have indicated, he could be healed.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.780]   Well, he'd been there for many years, and it never happened.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.780]   But one day Jesus came along, and Jesus healed that man and told him to roll up his little
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.120]   straw mat, put it on his shoulder, and walk.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.500]   And he did.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.340]   It was a massive, massive miracle, inescapably obvious to everybody who had seen that man
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.400]   there for decades.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.680]   As a result of that healing by Jesus, the Jews escalated their desire to kill him.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.120]   Their desire was already to kill him, but it was sort of under the surface.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.020]   It hadn't really boiled up.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.500]   But healing that man and telling him to take his bed and walk.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.540]   It brought their hostility to the surface.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.240]   And verse 16 tells us why.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.560]   For this reason, the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because He was doing these things on
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.260]   the Sabbath.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.340]   They had created false rules for the Sabbath.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.500]   The Old Testament did say that you were to limit your travel on the Sabbath, but certainly,
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.460]   a man who had been healed in a divine miracle could pick up his bed and walk away from the
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.960]   place of his healing.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.340]   But they were so circumscribed to these externals that they saw this as an act of blasphemy
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.840]   on the part of Jesus, doing even the work of healing, because you weren't supposed to
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.300]   work on the Sabbath.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.500]   And then having the man do the work of carrying his bed.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:52.220]   And so, in verse 18 we read, "For this reason, therefore, the Jews were seeking all the more
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.020]   to kill Him."
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.700]   They had been already seeking to kill Him, because He rejected their false religion,
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:06.800]   and now it was intensified because He had violated the Sabbath.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.740]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him, verse 18 says, because He not only was breaking
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.500]   the Sabbath, but also was calling God.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.500]   And so, in verse 18 we read, "For this reason, therefore, the Jews were seeking all the more
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   to kill Him."
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   They were seeking all the more to kill Him.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:15.380]   Verse 19, "Then therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, 'Instead of backing
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:23.540]   off when they were accusing Him of blaspheming, for claiming to be equal with God, He intensifies
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.740]   the reality of that and presses it even stronger.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.860]   Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself unless it is something
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.060]   He sees the Father doing.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.480]   For whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480]   For whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   For whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480]   For whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.720]   For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing, and the
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.920]   Father will show Him greater works than these so that you will marvel.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.540]   For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.840]   life to whom He wishes.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:05.080]   For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, so that
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.460]   all will honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:14.040]   For He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him."
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:22.160]   This is a terrifying set of claims by our Lord Jesus.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:30.260]   He is saying, "I'm not subject to your rules on the Sabbath.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.800]   I align with God.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.300]   I do what the Father does."
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.440]   Look at verse 17.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.000]   "My Father is working; I am working."
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.960]   And they understood that.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.660]   Verse 18, that He was saying He was equal with God.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.620]   He was one in nature, one in essence.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:57.420]   In fact, He is God, the ultimate blasphemy in the mind of the Jews.
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.560]   Not only was He one with God in nature, but He was one with God in work.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.060]   Verse 19, "Jesus answered and was saying to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.420]   can do nothing of Himself.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.600]   He can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.200]   For whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.340]   Everything you see Me do is because it is the Father doing it.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.980]   Everything you see Me do is the work of the Father, based on the will and purpose of the
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:24.980]   Father."
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.180]   So He is one with God in nature.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.160]   He is one with God the Father in works.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:37.400]   And then coming into verse 21 - or verse 20, rather - "The Father loves the Son."
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.940]   "The Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing."
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:50.440]   In other words, the third thing He says here is that He has full knowledge of everything
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.400]   that God knows.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.680]   So He is equal to God in nature, equal to God in works, and equal to God in truth, in
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.880]   revelation, in knowledge.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.380]   And then He adds, "The Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.460]   marvel."
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.140]   Greater works than the healing of that lame man.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.900]   And what would that be?
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.680]   Verses 21 and 22: "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.820]   so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:30.860]   For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son."
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:37.360]   Here He says He is one with God in power to raise the dead, and He is one with God in
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:45.600]   sovereignty to give life to whomever He will, and that He has been given the right to judge
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   everyone.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   That's how sovereign He is.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:57.800]   One in nature, one in works, one in knowledge, one in power, one in sovereignty with God.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.120]   Sovereignly He will judge.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:07.340]   Even the Father, verse 22 says, "doesn't judge, but has given all judgment to the Son."
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:13.220]   Final declaration: "So that all will honor the Son, even as they honor the Father.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.600]   He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent Him."
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.780]   The Jewish people thought they knew God, they honored God.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:26.180]   They did not, because you can't honor the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ if
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.400]   you don't honor Him as well.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.320]   So He is equal to God in nature, and works, and knowledge, and power, and sovereignty,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.560]   and judgment, authority, and honor.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:49.560]   He's just pressing this issue of equality to a degree that was shocking beyond comprehension
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.560]   to the Jews who thought He was a liar and a fraud.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:01.040]   He claims this power and authority, which is the heart of this section that I want you
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:07.300]   to look at in verses 21 and 22, when He says He has power to raise the dead and give life
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.300]   to them.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.840]   He says He has power to raise the dead and give them life, and He gives it to whomever
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.420]   He wishes.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:20.100]   And then He has the power and the authority to judge everyone.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:26.600]   This is ultimate sovereignty and ultimate power, the power to give life and the power
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   to judge.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:37.280]   He is the one who will make everyone alive, and He is the one who will judge everyone.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.300]   Since that's the case, look at verse 24: "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:48.660]   My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.820]   has passed out of death into life."
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.460]   This is the sum of all of it.
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.600]   This is an invitation.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.500]   This is a declaration of fact.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:05.420]   Since it is the Son of God who has the power to raise the dead and will do that, who has
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.260]   the authority to judge everyone.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:16.860]   "And will do that, then truly, truly, you must hear His word and believe in Him and
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:24.980]   the God who sent Him to have eternal life and to escape from death into life and not
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.820]   come to judgment."
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.480]   This is the simple reality of gospel truth.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.280]   Everybody's headed for eternal judgment.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.240]   Everyone is headed for a resurrection.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.240]   The resurrection is a resurrection unto damnation, a resurrection unto condemnation, a resurrection
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.420]   unto judgment.
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:52.300]   The only way to avoid that is to hear the word concerning Christ, believe in Him, believe
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:14:00.580]   in the One who sent Him, receive eternal life, avoid judgment, and pass out of death into
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.880]   life.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.700]   This is the heart of the gospel.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.220]   Many times when you hear about the gospel.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:13.020]   In our time, it seems as though people only want to talk about what it can accomplish
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.180]   for you in this life.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.180]   That's a lot.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.840]   I mean, we are currently blessed with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies in Christ,
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.600]   so there are benefits in this life.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.740]   But the reason for salvation is not to bring you bliss in this life, because even if you're
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.640]   a believer in this life, you still have to fight your way through all of the realities
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.200]   of a fallen world and you being a fallen man.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.980]   You're a fallen person.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:47.060]   Several years ago I preached a sermon based on Joel Osteen's book, Your Best Life Now.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.960]   And I said, "If this is your best life now, you're on your way to hell, and it is your
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.040]   best life.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:00.400]   But for those who are in Christ, this is far from our best life."
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:07.180]   So what the gospel offers you is an escape from eternal judgment.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:14.540]   Christ, the only One who can save you, will either be your Savior or He will be your judge.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:24.120]   He will either raise you to life abundant and eternal in His presence forever, or He
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:34.960]   will raise you to condemnation and judgment, to suffer forever out of His presence in a
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.160]   place the Bible calls hell.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.600]   So the word here is to listen to Him.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.380]   Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word concerning Christ.
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:57.640]   He is the one who raises the dead and gives life and escape from judgment.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:05.300]   So I can't emphasize probably enough for you to understand the shock of those kinds of
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.140]   words to the church.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.360]   But I can say that the word "lives" is a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360]   It's a very important word in the Bible.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.240]   I want to focus on just two things.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:37.960]   They are the statements in verses 21 and 22 that He raises the dead, gives them life,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.220]   and He is the judge.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:45.120]   He has the power to raise the dead and the authority to judge.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.680]   This is Jesus Christ.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.340]   Now as we keep that in mind, I want you to draw down to verse 25; this is the focus of
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.400]   the passage that I want to call to your attention.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:09.220]   Here He is going to demonstrate His power to raise the dead and to judge.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:16.080]   Listen to what it says: "Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and now is, when
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.720]   the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.320]   For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so He gave to the Son.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.280]   So to have life in Himself.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:36.440]   And He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:45.700]   Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:56.300]   His voice, all, and will come forth, those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.860]   faith, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.180]   Mark it.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.060]   Everybody is going to be raised from the dead.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.920]   Everybody.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.540]   Everybody who's ever lived and died.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:18.480]   And the Lord will have no problem sorting out that individual from the completely disintegrated
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:26.280]   and dissolved parts to bring back to life that same person in an eternal life.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:39.620]   form, some kind of body, a body suited for service and worship in heaven.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:47.280]   For the unbelievers, it's a body suited for suffering and punishment in hell.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:54.400]   Everybody will be raised from the dead, everybody.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   Don't marvel at this.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   And why does he say that?
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.600]   Because this is shocking.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.280]   This is shocking.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:08.240]   Now there are two aspects to resurrection that our Lord is referring to.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.680]   And if you go back to verse 25, I'll show you how He does that.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:17.020]   He says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.640]   hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live."
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.520]   Well, there wasn't a physical resurrection at that time.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.160]   The great final resurrection is yet to come in the future.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.460]   So what is He saying?
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:38.020]   An hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.560]   those who hear will live.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.340]   What does He mean by that?
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:47.620]   He's talking about spiritual resurrection, spiritual resurrection.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.960]   Look at the "now is."
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.520]   Even at the time in our Lord's ministry and life.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:01.460]   In which He was speaking here, He was giving life to people.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.860]   He was saving people.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.420]   He was raising them from spiritual death.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.960]   Jesus defined people as dead.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.760]   He said, "Let the dead bury their dead," in the book of Matthew.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.820]   And what He was saying is, "Let the spiritually dead bury the physically dead."
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.520]   The Scripture is clear about the deadness of the connected.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.720]   The deadness of the condition of the unconverted.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:32.980]   In the familiar story of the prodigal son, twice in that parable, Jesus defines the
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:41.960]   prodigal as dead, Luke 15, and dead in sin.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:50.480]   So even now, Jesus is saying, "He is giving life to the spiritually dead."
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.520]   And I can show you that.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.140]   Go back to John, chapter 1.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:01.140]   Before the cross - listen - before the cross and before the resurrection, He was giving
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:07.240]   life to people who believed in Him.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:15.940]   Listen to John 1:12, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.900]   of God, even to those who believe in His name."
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.320]   There's no cross yet.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.900]   There's no resurrection yet.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.140]   They weren't required to believe in His death and resurrection.
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.560]   It hadn't happened.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:36.040]   "But to any who received Him, having believed in Him, believed Him to be who He claimed
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:44.120]   to be, the Messiah, the Son of God, and received Him as Savior and Lord, without even knowing
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:50.320]   anything concerning an as yet unfulfilled event."
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:56.540]   The cross and the open tomb, He gave them the right to become a child of God.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:02.180]   So they could believe, and they could receive Christ, and have nothing in their minds at
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:09.700]   all about His death and resurrection, and they would still be children of God.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.440]   Go over to the familiar third chapter of John.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:18.460]   "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.320]   - " what?
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.720]   " - in Him, not in the cross, not even in the resurrection, but believes in Him, shall
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.080]   not perish but have eternal life.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.660]   For God didn't send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.700]   be saved through Him.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:40.560]   He who believes in Him is not judged, but he who has not believed in the name of the
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.980]   only begotten Son of God is judged already."
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.040]   So already He was making people alive.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.320]   He had been making people alive since the beginning.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.560]   Go back to Abraham.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:00.000]   Paul says about Abraham in Romans, "He believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness."
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   He was - here's the illustration of justification in Romans 4.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.240]   He believed God, and he was justified by believing in God, and Abraham knew nothing about the
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.140]   cross or the resurrection.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.320]   Now, I know Romans 10 says, "If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe in your Father, you
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   will be saved."
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.100]   And believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:26.700]   That's because on the side of the death and the cross, the death on the cross and the
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.300]   resurrection, you must believe in that.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:35.820]   But before that, it was a matter of believing all that had been revealed, and God accounted
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:44.320]   that kind of faith as the faith that embraced divine righteousness.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   You see, the same thing happens in Romans 10.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:54.040]   You see the same thing in the 36th verse of John 3: "He who believes in the Son has
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:01.140]   eternal life, and the wrath of God doesn't abide on him."
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.500]   So already people who believed in Him, like the disciples, they hadn't gotten to the cross
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.220]   yet, like the Samaritans.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.400]   We'll see that in chapter 4.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.320]   If you look at chapter 4 of John's gospel, you see many Samaritans who believed, down
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   in verse 41, after Jesus' encounter with the woman at the well, "Many more believed
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.660]   because of His word.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.660]   And they were saying to the woman, 'It is no longer because of what you said that we
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.840]   believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.140]   the world.'"
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:40.520]   They needed to believe that He was the Savior of the world, the anointed of God, the Redeemer,
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.320]   and believing they would be saved.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.660]   Now, that goes through the gospel of John.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:54.360]   Even before you get to the cross, He's calling people to believe in everything He has revealed.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:03.540]   At any point in progressive revelation, salvation came to one who believed what God had revealed.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.180]   Believing to the point that God had revealed was all that could be expected.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.020]   So that's the "now is" part.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.160]   Go back to verse 25.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.160]   "Now.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.620]   The dead are hearing the voice of the Son of God and coming to life."
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:25.520]   Spiritual life is being given to those who hear the voice of the Lord, who hear the voice
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.060]   of Christ.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:35.540]   The hour of life is already here, as it always has been.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.680]   Salvation is available.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.380]   But there's more to come.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.160]   An hour is also coming.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.400]   Also coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.580]   What is it that's coming?
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.680]   What's coming is the cross and the resurrection.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:59.040]   And an hour is coming when there will be a great sweeping response to the cross and the
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.100]   resurrection and faith.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.880]   We'll give birth to the church, and I read you that from Acts 2.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:11.480]   The hour that was coming was the cross, the resurrection, the birth of the church, the
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:18.120]   preaching of the gospel, the gospel of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.920]   So already the spirits of the dead were being made alive as Christ was giving them life.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:29.760]   But yet in the future, after the cross and resurrection, there would be an even greater
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.980]   explosion of faith.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.660]   On the day of Pentecost, 3,000 people were converted.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.940]   Another few chapters and you have 5,000 being converted, and pretty soon the gospel turns
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.220]   the world upside down.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.480]   So our Lord is talking here about spiritual life.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.400]   He raises the spiritually dead.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.140]   It takes us back to Ephesians 2.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:27:00.540]   You were dead in trespasses and sins, but God has, together with Christ, made you alive.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.100]   You have been given life.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.300]   Romans 6:13 describes Christians as those who have been made alive.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.180]   You were dead in your trespasses and sin.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:09.940]   Colossians 2.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:15.140]   You were dead in your transgressions.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:21.660]   Dead because you were literally born dead.
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.120]   Only the Lord could give you life.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   How did it happen?
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.380]   By hearing the voice of the Son of God.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.960]   Christ is the only one who can speak life into the dead.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.920]   He is the one who regenerates.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.560]   He is the one who gives spiritual life.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.260]   This is an amazing expression of spiritual power.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.860]   He takes the spiritually dead and regenerates them.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.200]   It's the new birth.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.100]   It's regeneration.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.000]   It's new life.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.500]   It's new creation.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.760]   And by the way, He is given the title "Son of God" in this particular ministry of giving
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.640]   life because only God can give life.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.020]   Only God is the source of life.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.720]   And those who hear the voice of the Son of God as He speaks.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.420]   Those who hear the voice of the Son of God as He speaks will live because He has the
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:19.960]   same power, verse 26, to give life that the Father has as well.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.480]   Ephesians 5:14 says, "Awake, you sleeper.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:30.180]   Arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light."
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.640]   This is what we do with the gospel.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:38.180]   We preach the message of salvation in Jesus Christ, by which the Holy Spirit is the light.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.600]   He is the light that makes people alive.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.460]   Colossians 2:13, "He made you alive."
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.200]   Spiritual resurrection.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:56.380]   He has the power for that, and He has the authority for that.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:03.600]   But the issue that I want to focus on just briefly is not that spiritual resurrection,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.500]   but rather what follows that spiritual resurrection in the future.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.120]   That is the physical resurrection.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.480]   Look at verse 27.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:19.980]   The Father not only gave the Son also to have life in Himself, but He gave Him authority
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.740]   to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.260]   He's the Son of God because it takes God to give life.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:34.840]   He's the Son of Man because it takes one who is a man to sit in judgment on men, lest men
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.780]   think they were judged by an unfair judgment.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:38.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.780]   That's the physical resurrection.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.860]   He gave Him the authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   So He is the life.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.760]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life," He said.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:06.260]   "Whoever finds Me" - Romans 8:35 - "finds life, and He also has the power to give life."
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.260]   He's the one who gives life.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:28.640]   Believing in Christ is the only way to escape Him as judge in the sense of a condemnation
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.360]   by judgment.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.660]   Everybody comes out of the tombs, they will hear His voice, not the spiritual resurrection,
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.940]   but the physical one.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.620]   And it will come.
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:42.220]   That those who believe in Christ will be saved.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:49.680]   That those who did the good deeds are taken to a resurrection of life, and those who committed
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.400]   evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:32:01.060]   The point there is simply to say again, "Everybody rises from the dead, absolutely every one."
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.200]   And would you notice that they will be judged by their deeds?
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.120]   You say, "Well, I thought salvation was by grace."
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.120]   You're right.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.720]   Not of works that any man should boast.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.180]   Salvation is by grace.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.140]   It's by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.220]   So why are we judged by our works?
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.120]   Because that's the validation of your salvation.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.500]   If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.640]   Old things have passed away and new things have come.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:35.240]   Or Ephesians 2:10, "You were created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.800]   ordained that you would walk in them."
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.140]   Paul says much the same in Romans 2:6-10, that the final judgment is the judgment of
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.140]   the world.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.080]   The final judgment will be a judgment based on works.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:52.520]   And the works of one who has been regenerated and given life and been transformed will manifest
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.080]   righteousness.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:03.760]   And it is by those works that they will receive the resurrection of life.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:12.100]   Again, this speaks to this important issue that salvation is not a matter of some experience,
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:18.720]   some point in your life, or some prayer, or some emotional connection with Jesus.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.980]   You will be judged on your works.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:29.740]   They don't save you, but they affirm the reality of your salvation.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:36.160]   If you are truly transformed as a child of God, it shows.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:42.060]   But just think of it: "An hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear His
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   voice."
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:49.200]   The power to do that is stunning, incomprehensible.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:56.900]   Taking you back to the creation, in six days the triune God spoke the entire universe
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.400]   and everything into it into existence - everything.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.220]   In six days He created everything.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:10.040]   So it's really not a difficult situation for Him to raise the dead and reassemble them
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.020]   in some eternal form fit for heaven.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.340]   Heaven or hell.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:22.780]   But the power to do that is beyond any kind of comprehension.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:28.340]   I think we know enough science to know that matter is never really destroyed; it just
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.700]   changes form.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:39.640]   So the Lord will reach back into the creation and reassemble everyone in some expression
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.980]   of who they actually were.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:51.220]   They will continue to be who they were, only in a physical body suited for heaven or hell.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.840]   When I say "physical," that's the only word I can use.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.500]   It's not an ethereal body; it's an actual body.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:01.580]   Jesus walked and talked and ate, and the believers will have a glorified body.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:06.240]   Young believers will have a body also that can feel pain.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.940]   Hell is described as burning, darkness, pain.
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:18.120]   Gnashing of teeth, agony.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.880]   So this is astounding power.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:26.400]   Again, you have to put yourself in the position those Jews are in as He is speaking this to
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   them.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.800]   First, there was enough that He did something on the Sabbath and then said He could do what
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:38.920]   God did because He was God, to go from there to saying, "I have the power to raise every
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.900]   single person from the dead."
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:47.220]   "I have the power to bring them to judgment, and then I have the authority to judge them."
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:53.360]   Obviously, for those who have been raised spiritually, there is no condemnation, Romans
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.360]   8:1.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:01.460]   And they are raised to the resurrection of life, not judgment.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:06.180]   Those who committed evil deeds and therefore demonstrate there was no transformation have
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.960]   a resurrection of judgment.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.860]   This is where the world is headed.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:18.300]   It's pretty shocking when you think about how cavalier people are about the end of their
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.200]   life, how little they think about it.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.700]   Luke 14 talks about the resurrection of the righteous.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.860]   That will happen at the rapture of the church and at the end of the tribulation, as the
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:36.420]   saints are all raised and brought into the thousand-year kingdom with Christ.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:41.820]   At the end of that thousand years is the resurrection of the unjust.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.000]   It's a special resurrection.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:58.200]   I want to close by showing you that resurrection in Revelation, chapter 20.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.680]   In the book of Revelation, we follow the chronology.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:11.780]   Christ comes in chapter 19, sets up His kingdom for a thousand years.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:19.160]   And after the thousand years, look at verse 5 of Revelation 20, "The rest of the dead
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.540]   didn't come to life until the thousand years were completed."
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.060]   That's a parenthetical statement.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:32.820]   So the unbelieving dead will remain in the grave until the thousand-year millennial kingdom
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.120]   is finished.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:40.860]   The saints, first group of them will be taken at the rapture of the church, then comes the
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.740]   tribulation.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:48.400]   The Old Testament saints at the end of the tribulation, Daniel, chapter 12, indicates
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.580]   will be raised from the dead.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:55.740]   And so you'll have the New Testament believers and the Old Testament believers in glorified,
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.840]   resurrected form coming back with Christ.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.840]   You see that in chapter 19.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.040]   They come back with Him.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:09.540]   Their robes are washed white to reign with Him on the earth, all the resurrected saints.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.700]   During that thousand years, there will be still praise.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:16.960]   They will be called the people who went into that kingdom alive on earth as believers.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.920]   They will have offspring over the thousand years.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.480]   There will be a rebellion and insurrection against God at the end by those who refuse
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.460]   to believe even when Christ is reigning in the world.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.820]   And there will be a judgment at the end of the thousand years, but that will involve
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.980]   all the unrighteous dead.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:41.660]   That's exactly what it says: "The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.980]   years were completed."
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.080]   The first resurrection, however, is different.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:52.920]   The first resurrection, verse 6, is for the blessed and holy ones.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.400]   They're in the first resurrection.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:02.740]   Over these, the second death - the second death is that eternal death - has no power.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:10.500]   They will be priests of God and Christ and reign with Him during His thousand-year kingdom.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.620]   So all the saints are raised.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.000]   They're raised to go into the kingdom.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   But when the kingdom is over, the rest of the dead are brought to life.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.020]   Go down to verse 11.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:27.880]   Here is the picture of that judgment: "I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:35.900]   it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:40.320]   I saw the dead, the great and the small."
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.580]   Significant and insignificant.
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:47.380]   "Standing before the throne, and books were opened.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.780]   And another book was opened, which is the book of life.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:55.040]   And the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books according to their
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.960]   deeds.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:02.720]   And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.420]   were in them.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:11.540]   And they were judged, every one of them, according to their deeds; then death and Hades were
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.940]   thrown into the lake of fire."
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.140]   This is the second death, the lake of fire.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.520]   "And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.520]   lake of fire."
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:28.480]   If your name is not in the book of life, you're going to be judged by your deeds, and your
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:34.760]   deeds will not be sufficient.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:41.500]   Whether the body is in the ground or in the sea, every unbeliever will be at that place.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.120]   They will not be judged.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:48.440]   And they will be judged for their sins.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:56.200]   And then sent to the eternal lake of fire.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.120]   For all that we celebrate in the resurrection of Christ, and rightly we have done that today,
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.560]   and lifted up our hearts in praise.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:11.460]   For all that we are grateful for, for all the joy, for all the hallelujahs, for the
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:18.020]   resurrection of Christ, that's only for those who listen to His voice, who know Him and
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.540]   have received life from Him.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:30.340]   For the rest, this is a terrifying reality, because they killed Him, but God raised Him.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:34.720]   And He has now the power to give life, and He will raise everyone.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:41.420]   And then He has the authority to judge everyone, and He will judge them by their deeds.
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:54.280]   And unless those deeds manifest the transformation of salvation, they will be thrown into the
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.500]   lake of fire.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.040]   That's the second death.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:08.860]   That is the fact Scripture lays out, and that's where the Bible draws to a conclusion.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.380]   Be warned.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:23.440]   Down in verse 8 of chapter 21: "For the cowardly and unbelieving, and abominable and murderers,
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:30.280]   and immoral persons and sorcerers, and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:38.800]   that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:45.560]   You want to be a part of the first resurrection, right?
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:52.180]   The resurrection of the just, the resurrection of the righteous.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:43:07.400]   One final word from Scripture, Hebrews 10:26: "If we go on sinning willfully after receiving
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.580]   the knowledge of the truth…"
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.520]   You've heard the gospel, you know Christ alone saves.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:19.020]   "But you go on sinning willfully, rejecting, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sin."
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:23.940]   If you reject Christ, there's no sacrifice for sin, so you will bear your own sins to
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.940]   the judgment and pay for them forever.
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:33.580]   All you have left if you go on sinning willfully, rejecting the knowledge of the truth, the
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:38.360]   gospel, all you have left is a terrifying expectation of death.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:44.920]   "And the fire of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries."
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.120]   All there is left is hell.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:55.580]   And He gives an illustration or a comparison: "Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.620]   dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.220]   If you violate the law of Moses, that's Old Testament order.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:06.980]   "How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.140]   the Son of God?
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.220]   And regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which He was sanctified and has
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.180]   insulted the Spirit of grace?"
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:19.160]   When you insult the Spirit of grace by rejecting the gospel, when you trample underfoot the
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:30.340]   Son of God by rejecting His sacrifice, there's a much severer punishment.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:36.920]   And God says, "Vengeance is Mine," verse 30, "I will repay, the Lord will judge His
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.920]   people."
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.920]   And He says, "The Lord will judge the people."
