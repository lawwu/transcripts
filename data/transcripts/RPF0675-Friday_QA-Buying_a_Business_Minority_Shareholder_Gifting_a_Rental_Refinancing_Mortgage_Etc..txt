[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.040]   Today we have, looks like, five callers on the line, and we go first to Lou in Toronto.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.040]   Lou, welcome to the show.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040]   Louie (00:00): Hey, Josh.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.840]   I want to get some advice on some of my plans for next year.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.320]   I'm looking to buy a business early next year.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   I'm currently going through the process of selling an investment property to raise equity
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680]   for that.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.520]   My question is more around the timing in the new year.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.240]   I've got a few different ideas that I wanted to get your opinion on.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.640]   First off would be, I continue in my current job.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.360]   I conduct my search nights and weekends.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.120]   And once I have something lined up and ready to pull the trigger on, then I'd go and quit
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.600]   my job and then start this new venture.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.280]   The other option I was looking at is waiting for the new year.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.840]   I get my year in bonus.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.280]   I then quit, or actually go on, I have the option of going on maternity leave, which
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.680]   is a nice little bonus.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.200]   So I'd have some income coming in and conduct my search full time.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.080]   And once I have something lined up, then obviously go into that full time.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:35.640]   The third option is something similar, except when I'd quit, I'd take a month off.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.960]   I would go back and visit family for a month and then dive into the search full time from
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.320]   there.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.960]   And obviously there's risks and benefits for all those options.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:04:00.080]   In terms of some other details around me, I'm the provider for the family.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.160]   My wife stayed at home.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.880]   So taking that time off does really impact.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.560]   We would have some maternity income, which would be about $500 a week versus about $1,500
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.280]   a week for our regular income.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.600]   In terms of our net worth and stuff like that, we're probably around about $500,000 looking
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.000]   at equity for the business, so about $300,000.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:38.520]   So liquidity and cashflow of $100,000 and then retaining 20% or $100,000 in equity in
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.280]   the home.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.840]   And how much are you currently earning at your job?
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.000]   It's about $110,000 gross.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.320]   It ends up being about $1,500 a week.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.160]   Would you be able to effectively conduct a search for the type of business you're planning
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.440]   to move into on nights and weekends?
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.920]   That is a tricky question.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.560]   I sort of struggled with that.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.680]   I think I could.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.960]   It would be a lot more work.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:25.160]   Part of the thing that sort of weighs on me with that would be perhaps you're missing
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:33.320]   out on the opportunity by not investing yourself full time in that search.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.800]   Or possibly the deal that you end up making isn't as of higher quality as what you could
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.480]   have if you did invest all your time and all your focus into that.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.760]   On the flip side, I can also see, well, if you're doing nothing but that, you'd kind
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.400]   of feel a bit of pressure to get something rolling, which maybe is less than ideal as
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   well.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   Right.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.360]   Yeah, I think your analysis there is spot on.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.000]   And to me, that would be a big, big deal.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.680]   If you're the sole income earner for your family, obviously you have some money saved
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.800]   so that can get you through a time.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.700]   But if you're the sole income earner for your family, you quit your job and you focus exclusively
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.840]   on finding a business, you can't make business deals pop out of the woodwork.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.560]   They occur when they occur naturally in the cycle of the current owner, etc.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.820]   And just from a negotiating perspective, if the current owner knows that you've been looking
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.040]   for a business for a while, you quit your job, you've got to have something, that's
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.800]   a big negotiating chip in their favor versus you're well employed, you're making lots of
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.640]   money, you're looking for a business and you're serious about it, but you don't have to have
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.640]   this one.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   You've got some other candidates, etc.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.960]   And I'm not sure that when you talk about looking for a business, I don't think we need
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.840]   to go into the details of the specific type of business, I'm not sure how you could actually
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.760]   invest 50, 60 hours a week into looking for a business.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.000]   Could you profitably invest 50 to 60 hours a week into looking for the kind of business
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.480]   that you want to move into?
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.840]   That is a great question.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.760]   I could definitely see that being hard to do.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:36.000]   I do see the benefit though of, as opposed to sort of like the online and telephone inquiries
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.880]   and getting information that way, you would have more time to set up meetings and sort
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:55.000]   of create the network with brokers and in that space, which could lead to better quality
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.880]   deals that haven't actually hit the market yet.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.720]   Does your job allow you normal levels of flexibility where you could take a midday meeting if you
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.360]   came in a little bit early, you could take some lunches, you could take a day off here
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.200]   or there if you needed to, or is it a hardcore, you've got to be here nine to five every day
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   kind of job?
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.120]   It does have that flexibility.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.160]   It is sort of like a middle management type role.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:31.120]   Taking that time off does, that work doesn't disappear as opposed to say, say for a shift
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:37.480]   work where you take the time off, it has to be covered by someone else.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:43.440]   That could be done, but then it's also, it is tricky trying to balance that work.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.920]   Have you and your wife already had the baby or is the baby expected at a certain time?
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.520]   She's been a month old now.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.680]   So you can still take off maternity leave now?
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   Yes.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.680]   Yes, I'm up in Canada.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.360]   So it's a year maternity leave.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:09.240]   So and say in about four months time I took maternity leave, I would still have eight
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.680]   months maternity leave available to me.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.480]   But you don't get paid during maternity leave or do you?
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:28.760]   I would get about $500 a week as opposed to about $1,500 of regular income.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:37.720]   So the income is not such a, so important specifically because you are, you're implying
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.240]   that you're positioned either way.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.760]   You know, you're considering completely quitting, taking a month off, visiting family, etc.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.920]   So certainly unless there's some really compelling thing that you really want to do with option
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.240]   three, I don't think you should go with option three.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.560]   Why quit if you don't have to?
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.080]   At the very least you could hedge your bets and use maternity leave.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.600]   But there's not, probably not any reason to really quit.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   And with a month old baby.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.080]   I'm sorry, I didn't actually mean, when I mean quit, I would in either a scenario would
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.080]   take maternity leave.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.560]   And then I have the option of coming back if things did go pear-shaped.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.360]   Right, right.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.380]   If it were me, I think I would do it nights and weekends.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:25.420]   And I would schedule a day off, schedule a half a day, every couple of weeks to do those
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.780]   interviews, to do that networking, etc.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.940]   Now very clearly that could raise your profile at work.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.720]   If you are not accustomed to taking those times away from the office during the day,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.500]   now all of a sudden you're gone for two hours here, you're gone for a half a day there.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.320]   It's certainly possible that they would say, are you looking for another job?
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.780]   But that's probably not a big concern for you, even if that were the case.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.980]   But I think that, I think my option would go in option number one.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.720]   If you are earning, you know, let's just do the math here.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.660]   If you are earning $115,000 per year, ignore taxes, let's just say $75,000 net of taxes,
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.000]   $75,000 to $100,000 net of taxes.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.560]   If you're in a position where you would consider simply stopping work and living on savings
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:23.620]   while looking for a business, then that basically implies that you could save virtually, you
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.540]   know, in a sense, all $75,000 or $100,000.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:34.140]   Well at a net worth of $500,000, for you to be able to save $100,000 over a year of working
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.500]   would be a huge deal.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.680]   It's a dramatic increase in your net wealth.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.760]   So it's not like the income is unimportant to you.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.160]   So I would keep the income coming in, save like crazy, keep my expenses as low as possible,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.380]   and look diligently at nights and on weekends for the type of business opportunity, and
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.100]   then schedule in the time that I need during the work week.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.460]   I wouldn't sacrifice to not be able to take those midday meetings and just do everything
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.660]   online.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:09.380]   But it's hard for me to imagine how you could productively employ 50 to 60 hours a week
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.940]   looking for a business.
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.780]   I can understand how you could employ 20 hours a week looking for a business.
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:20.900]   I can understand how you could employ 10 hours a week, you know, doing interviews or doing
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.920]   due diligence, etc.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.620]   But I think you could work that around your job and the extra money will be helpful to
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.760]   you when you do find the business.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.360]   And I think it puts you in a much stronger negotiating position with the business seller.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.120]   It also potentially puts you in a better financing position where you have an income.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.240]   So if you need to borrow money, you have an income, it's easier for you to borrow money
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.440]   when you have an income than when you're unemployed.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.620]   And it takes the bear off of your back of saying, "I've got to get this business.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.440]   I've got to make this deal work," which you know as well as I do, that's when you make
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.540]   a bad deal.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:13:00.740]   So I would go with number one until I were convinced that I had to do something different.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:06.180]   And then if you're convinced that you have to do something different, then maybe go to
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.000]   maternity leave and go to that option as well.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   But the goal of course, do it, find something as quickly as possible, then you can make
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.400]   the transition as quickly as possible.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.560]   But I wouldn't quit.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.920]   Not with a new baby, not with a wife at home, not without a business in hand, I wouldn't
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   quit.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   Okay.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   Thanks, Josh.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.760]   All right, we go now to Dave in New York City.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.240]   Dave, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   Hey, Josh.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   Thank you.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   Can you hear me?
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   Yes, sir.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   Sounds good.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.680]   I have a similar question about a potential purchase into a business.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:49.320]   My questions for you are, I'm an employee and I have an opportunity to buy a minority
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.920]   interest in the business.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.960]   I've been there for eight years or so.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:00.720]   And what are your thoughts on what are some of the key protections you might advise somebody
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.080]   when entering into this kind of deal?
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:13.000]   Secondly, if you had any thoughts about persuasion, discussion, negotiation for why selling equity
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.800]   to some employees would be beneficial.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.560]   And like the prior caller, some of the funding options, if any of those, if you feel like
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.160]   you have any insight on any of those three, I'd love to hear them.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.640]   In terms of your process of buying in, what is the deal that's been offered you?
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:40.760]   We don't have a structure yet other than this is something that was on the table as part
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.920]   of like the opportunity come join this business, help us grow it.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.760]   And now we're at the stage where we're now, the owner has said, I'm interested in pursuing
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.760]   this.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.420]   Let's figure out some ways to do so.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.600]   And so it's a relatively blank canvas.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.440]   Do you think that this kind of opportunity would ever result in your moving into a majority
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.960]   ownership stake?
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.360]   No.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:13.600]   So if that's the case, then in a way, there's really no point in looking at this as a business
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.660]   owner.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.320]   This is basically a form of incentive-based compensation.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.140]   The idea being that you'll be more closely tied to the business and you have an opportunity
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.320]   to share in the profits of the company.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.960]   But if you're only going to be a minority owner, then there's not going to be any, you're
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.520]   not ultimately going to have control of the business.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.760]   How many other owners are there currently?
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.540]   There's currently one owner who recently bought out, there were two partners, the current
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:53.440]   owner as 100% and earlier this year bought out the other partner.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.480]   And the idea was with the second partner gone, there's opportunities for us too.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.300]   And then there'd be three employees, myself included, who would potentially be stepping
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.040]   into that other position.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.080]   And what's the nature of the business?
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.560]   It's a training company.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   Okay.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.440]   Okay, great.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.260]   So here's how I look at it.
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:23.200]   If you've got one majority partner in a company that doesn't have a lot of significant assets
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:31.640]   or equipment, et cetera, and if you expect that current majority owner to continue as
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.180]   an owner, then you're never going to wind up controlling this business.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.760]   This is not the kind of thing that you're going to wind up controlling.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.880]   So just think about it like a form of incentive-based compensation.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.360]   That's really all it is.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.160]   You aren't going to have any real input in the decisions.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.840]   Yes, you can offer your opinion, maybe there'll be some change in status if the lead owner
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.160]   has a company meeting and says, "Let's talk to the partners."
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.240]   Yeah, they'll listen to you, but probably he's listening to you now.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.000]   So is that going to be that big of a difference?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.560]   I don't see it.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.640]   And if you don't think you're going to grow into a majority owner at some point yourself,
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.820]   then this isn't really owning a business.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.680]   This is having a minority stake in a business.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.040]   So you analyze it on that basis.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.400]   It's great, absolutely, to have a minority stake, but you analyze it differently than
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.480]   something that you can control.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:32.800]   So with this case, you look at it and say, "Will my compensation go up based upon having
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.520]   a stake in the business?"
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.320]   And it might be, right?
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:43.280]   The idea from the owner's perspective, if I own 100% of a company, why would I give
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.200]   away some percentage of my ownership in that situation as a business owner?
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:54.840]   The number one reason I want to do that is I want to create increased loyalty on behalf
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:02.840]   of my employees, and I want a way to compensate them on their productivity rather than with
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.220]   a promise.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:09.040]   So the loyalty thing is a big deal, because for the owner of a company, the hardest thing
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   that they have to do is to find good employees who work well in the company.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.400]   And so you want to do everything you can as the owner of a business to get your good employees
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.440]   to be connected to you very tightly.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.160]   In the financial planning world, we call it golden handcuffs.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.000]   And so you create programs that are going to put golden handcuffs around the wrists
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   of your employees.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.020]   You create some form of deferred compensation plan so that when they're thinking about going
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.840]   somewhere else, but they recognize, "I'm not vested in a pension yet, but I'm going to
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.800]   vest in a couple of years," then they say, "Well, I'll go ahead and vest in this pension."
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.760]   You build perks into the job that would be hard for them to replace, and you try to make
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.880]   sure that they have a long stake in it.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.720]   Now, the easiest plan, the easiest way for me as a business owner to put golden handcuffs
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.900]   around my employee is to give them a minority stake in the business, because now they're
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:12.260]   going to share in the profits of the business, but I'm off the hook for any kind of promises.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:17.900]   If I make a specific promise of a deferred compensation program that I have to fund,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:24.240]   and my share of that funding is $100,000 per year, I've created a cash flow liability of
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.100]   $100,000 per year.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.840]   But if I create a share of ownership that you would expect that your share of the profits
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.800]   of the company is $100,000 per year, I only have to pay you that share of ownership if
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:44.340]   we actually produce the $100,000 of profit, the extra $100,000 of profit that would, on
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.540]   a pro rata basis, to your shares.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.760]   That's the basic reason that I, as a business owner, would be trying to do that, would be
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:57.620]   trying to create that opportunity for you, is I want to create loyalty and put golden
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:02.740]   handcuffs around my employees' wrists so that they will be incentivized to stay with me
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.740]   longer.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.220]   So now let's flip and let's talk about it from your perspective.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.620]   Is that a good thing to do?
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.180]   Well, the answer is, is that the best deal that you can get?
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:17.140]   Certainly, if you're making $300,000 per year today, and the boss says, "Tell you what,
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:23.540]   I'm going to give you 10% of the company, and your 10% stake would make you an extra
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.260]   $100,000 per year at the current profit margin, etc.," and the boss is just giving you that
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.860]   as a gift, now your income is going to go up to $400,000.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.260]   Well, of course, why not?
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:39.300]   There's no reason not to accept that, because even though you are now a minority shareholder,
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.620]   you're not stuck at the company.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.700]   You could leave, you can go somewhere else, and now you can just simply take your share
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.380]   of the profits, whether or not you're working there or not.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.100]   So there's no reason not to take it.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.740]   Now if there's a buy-in process of some kind, then it becomes a little bit more difficult.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.780]   If you have to buy in, if you have to pay, if you have to create some difference other
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.500]   than just simply your labor, now you have to assess what's going to be the long-term
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:10.100]   value of this company and of these shares of the company based upon my buy-in.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.860]   Your analysis there would be, number one, how much is it going to cost me versus what
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.380]   am I going to get?
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:22.460]   So if it's going to cost me $100,000 to buy in over the next year, and then I create $100,000
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.740]   per year of extra money, well, it's worth considering it.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.740]   But where is the profits of the company going to go?
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.740]   Are they going to go up, going to go down, et cetera?
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.780]   And then the second thing is, what's going to be my protection?
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:37.820]   Because with a small private company, you don't have any ability to control the direction
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.900]   of the company.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:45.300]   The owner gives you and the other three employees 20%, but now dies.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.380]   And now his widow is caring for the company or gets divorced.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.820]   And now all of a sudden you're in business with someone else.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.500]   And if you have a company that's just a small company that doesn't have a lot of plants,
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:59.460]   a lot of equipment, a lot of big professional management, as most smaller companies are,
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:05.140]   there's a good chance that company dies with the death or the disability of something of
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.300]   the founder.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.980]   So could you be getting in at the entry level of a Coca-Cola?
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.340]   Certainly you could.
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.820]   But it sounds like that's probably not the kind of company that you're working for.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.580]   So as far as I'm concerned, you look at it and say, is this the best deal that you can
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.580]   get?
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.140]   In some ways, you're better off getting a deal of more guaranteed compensation or you're
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:32.260]   better off getting a deal, sometimes a deal where you have a more direct scenario.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.700]   For example, if I knew I was never going to become a majority owner, would I rather just
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:45.020]   have a different commission structure based upon my actual productivity versus a share
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.260]   in the profits of the company?
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.260]   Maybe.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.460]   You'd have to look at the numbers.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:54.360]   But it's hard for you to say what's going to happen with the profits of the company.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.980]   Profits are dependent upon the expenses of the company, and you don't have control over
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.300]   that necessarily.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.380]   Whereas if you have a direct commission structure that's paid to you based upon your activity,
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.440]   that can open up a little bit more.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.380]   So that's how I would analyze it and think it through.
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.580]   Not a bad thing, but this isn't going to be the kind of thing where you're going to ultimately
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.580]   control the company.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.020]   It's just a matter of, is this the best deal you can get?
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.140]   Right.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:25.780]   And along that line of what is the cost versus what do I get, if we are a profitable company,
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:32.340]   so you can look at, in that regard, you could look at this as what are the returns that
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:39.220]   I can expect and project as best I can having my money in this business, my business, or
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:44.300]   the business I'm operating in, versus invested in the market at large.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.020]   Is that a reasonable way to think about this?
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.220]   I think it is, as long as you adjust for risk, certainly.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.420]   It can be a wonderful thing and a wonderful investment for you, especially if the business
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.100]   is on a growth path.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.640]   Let's say that now there's one owner, but there's three key employees, but the owner
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:08.420]   has plans to quadruple the size of the company, and he wants you and the other three employees
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.860]   to participate in that.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.820]   Well, if you can quadruple the size of the company, and now you own 10% of a company
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.940]   that's quadrupled in size, that could be an extremely wonderful return.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:24.340]   And definitely, without question, if the owner has growth plans like that, and you're a key
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.180]   part of them, it could be, without question, one of the best investments you could make,
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:35.180]   because now you're leveraging the work, labor, and productivity of other people, of a larger
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.780]   growing company.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:42.080]   And even if you never control the company, that could be a tremendous financial benefit
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   for you.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.380]   And yes, without question, you should compare that to all of the other investment opportunities
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.740]   you have.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:53.420]   And it better be a way higher return than when you get buying GE stock on the stock
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.600]   market, because a small business has a lot more room to grow, usually.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.380]   It can, and you can have a much bigger stake.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.480]   And so yeah, it certainly is much more impactful.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:11.540]   But there's a very different risk profile between your having some shares of a very
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.580]   large company that has professional management, etc., versus you're having the shares of a
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.820]   company that is probably very dependent on a few key people, and is working in a much
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.440]   smaller market that could change at any time.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.860]   So I wouldn't compare them exactly, but I would pursue, without question, the smaller
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.380]   business and the productivity of that, even if it did cost me some money.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.380]   >>Toby: Great.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.380]   All right, great.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.380]   Thanks for all this insight.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.380]   I really appreciate all you do.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.380]   >>Steve: My pleasure.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:45.500]   I don't know if there's any specific suggestions at this point on the actual structure, the
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.500]   details.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.700]   You'll hammer that out with the owner and with the lawyers.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.920]   I think the biggest thing that I would want to see is simply fair negotiations, and a
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:00.760]   lot of openness, and a lot of clear, honest communication, and making sure that everybody
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.220]   understands the incentives in place.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.400]   You want a win-win deal.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.800]   You want to make sure that the owner does not...
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.840]   You need the owner to feel like he's getting the better end of the deal, because now his
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.560]   team is being enhanced.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.020]   You don't want him to feel like he's getting the worse end of the deal, because he's lost
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.000]   30% of his company.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.200]   You want to make sure that you feel like you're getting the better end of the deal, where
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:30.880]   now you're participating in the profits of the company instead of just having a higher
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.880]   salary.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.320]   Which, from a tax planning perspective, by the way, I guess we should mention that, certainly
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.520]   it can be much better for you to be a partial owner of the company than just to receive
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.720]   more earned income.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.360]   You may be able to put in place some interesting executive benefit programs as an owner of
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.520]   the company or a key employee that you may or may not have access to right now.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.520]   Think about that.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.300]   I think you're a little bit premature on the tax planning.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.280]   We go now to Mark in Texas.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   Mark, welcome to the show.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   Mark Cunningham Hi, Joshua.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   Good to talk to you.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.280]   Thanks for all you do.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.280]   My pleasure.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.280]   Can you hear me?
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.280]   Yes, go ahead.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.280]   Sounds good.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   Okay, good.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   My dad has had a couple of rental properties for years and years.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:22.160]   He's been making noise for a few years about getting rid of those and getting out of that
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.280]   phase, part of his financial life.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:34.600]   He's decided to transfer ownership of this one house to my sister and myself.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:41.080]   This house is a rental house in a suburb about 30 minutes away from where I live.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.280]   Its value is $160,000.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.040]   The current renter is moving out.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.000]   He's been using a property management company and he's been very hands-off, letting them
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.680]   handle most everything.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:08.000]   His CPA, I think, has advised him that to transfer it to us would save about a $25,000
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:17.680]   tax bill that he will have to pay if he sells it himself and takes the proceeds.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:26.360]   He's also been helping us pay for some college tuition for our kids.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:36.400]   He's thinking that this will also be the funding for some of that ongoing tuition stuff for
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.400]   my side.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.000]   It doesn't affect my sister.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.600]   There's that objective thing that we're checking as well.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:51.880]   I'm just looking to see if we turn around and sell the property after it's transferred
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:29:05.960]   to us, am I foregoing any great opportunities in particular to transact this all in this
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.800]   way?
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.680]   I am open.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:15.360]   I like the idea of having rental property, but this has come on suddenly and I don't
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.680]   know that I'm prepared to take on this house.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:25.360]   It may need some significant updating or repairs.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.760]   Just want to see where you go with this.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   How old is your dad?
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.640]   My dad is 78.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:39.320]   Do you know about what his basis in the property is?
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:45.400]   I think it's around $100,000.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:53.320]   Do you know what your dad's total income is or his marginal tax bracket?
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:02.240]   Is it high, higher than yours, low, lower than yours?
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.200]   Higher than mine.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:11.160]   It's probably at the 25 to 32 range, somewhere in there.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   He's retired.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.480]   How much is your dad's net worth?
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:23.520]   It's probably a million two.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.760]   Let's talk just about the one property first.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:32.880]   If your dad sells the property right now, he's going to ... Let's just assume that his
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   adjusted basis on the property is $100,000.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.600]   That may or may not be true.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   It's probably not.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.840]   It's probably his adjusted basis is lower because of the fact that you said his accountant
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.200]   says he's going to have a $25,000 tax bill.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:55.600]   It would be pretty unusual if the property has $160,000 value but his true basis is $100,000.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.480]   I don't see why we would lose $25,000 of taxes.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:05.840]   Most likely, his adjusted basis is much lower than $100,000 for some reason.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   There's going to be additional recapture of gains that's different.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.240]   For the sake of our discussion, I'm going to use that $100,000 and $160,000 number so
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.080]   you understand the principle.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.440]   Let's go through some scenarios.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.340]   Scenario number one is your dad just simply sells the property.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:29.960]   He's going to sell the property and he's going to have $60,000 of capital gain.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:36.520]   If he has $60,000 of capital gain, he's going to pay long-term capital gains taxes on that
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.480]   $60,000.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:46.080]   Let's assume that he winds up netting $125,000 number.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.560]   Let's say that he nets $135,000 of cash after the sale.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:59.880]   At this point in time, with $135,000 of cash, he can give you and your sister each $70,000
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.920]   of cash.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   He gives it to you guys.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.200]   He's still well under his lifetime gifting amounts for gifting exclusion, file a gift
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.440]   tax return, but he gives you guys each $70,000 cash.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.320]   You walk away free and clear.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   That's the first thing.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   Make sense?
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.320]   >> Steven: Yep.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   >> Adam: Okay.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.600]   Now, option two is going to be if he gives you the house.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.280]   Let's say that he gives you and your sister the house.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.760]   He deeds it over to you.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:36.240]   Well, you're going to inherit the property, but you're going to keep the basis of the
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.920]   property as it's given to you.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.920]   You have $100,000-
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.920]   >> Steven: Current value?
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   >> Adam: Sorry?
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.160]   >> Steven: Current value?
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.240]   >> Adam: No, the basis.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.800]   You will inherit his tax basis.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.080]   He's going to give you the property.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.000]   It's worth $160,000, but he has $100,000 tax basis in the property.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.280]   He gives it to you.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.800]   You and your sister put it on the market.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.840]   You sell it for $160,000.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:05.360]   Now, you have a $60,000 capital gain.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.640]   You're going to pay capital gains taxes on the $60,000, you and your sister, at long-term
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.240]   capital gains rates.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.620]   You're going to pay the same amount of taxes probably that he is, unless there's some dramatic
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:23.560]   difference in your effective bracket, depending on which long-term capital gains tax bracket
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.320]   you're in, etc.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.740]   I don't see that there's a big win there either way.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.080]   It really isn't going to be that big of a difference one way or the other because when
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.280]   you get the property as a gift from him, you don't get a step up in tax basis.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.960]   >> Steven: Okay, I thought you did.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   >> Adam: No, you don't.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.680]   You don't, not as a gift.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.320]   Now, how could you get a step up in tax basis?
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:53.760]   Well, your dad can continue to own the property and then he can keep it until he dies.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.920]   And then when he dies, he can leave you the property in his will.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:03.800]   And in that situation, if he leaves you the property in his will, then he can put himself
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.640]   ... So let's just assume that your dad keeps the property.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.480]   Three years from now, he dies.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.040]   The property is sold.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.320]   Now as the executive's will, you sell the property for $180,000.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.300]   At that point in time, you have $180,000 that you split with your sister and there's no
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.920]   capital gains taxes paid in that scenario.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.520]   So the only way to get a step up in tax basis for this property is for him to continue owning
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.120]   the property until he dies.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:41.400]   Now, I don't know if he should do that or not, but I'll tell you here are some ideas,
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   some ways that you could do that, that you could make this work if he wanted to keep
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.440]   owning it.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.600]   The first thing I would say is that if he's just simply tired of managing it, let's say
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.520]   it's a good property, but he's tired of managing it, then you can start a property management
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:05.240]   company and/or your children who are in college can start a property management company and
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:11.240]   you can make an agreement with him to manage the property for him in exchange for a management
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.360]   fee.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.960]   And that I think would be a really good idea.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.800]   I would much rather have your children start a small property management company under
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:26.080]   his tutelage and then they receive 10% of the rents on the property as compensation
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:33.640]   rather than them just simply getting money and being given money for their college tuition.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.120]   You can do the same thing.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.880]   And there would be substantial tax benefits for you and for your children in having a
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.620]   property management business.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:46.140]   It could be the seed of a bigger business and you can have other clients that you also
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:53.040]   manage property for and it could provide you with the ability to try out being a landlord
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.540]   without having to go and actually buy the property.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:00.020]   This could be a good way for you to see do you yourself want to be a landlord or not.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.720]   That would be one way of accessing some of the money in it.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.560]   The next thing is let's say you say, "Well, 10% of the rents is not going to solve our
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.560]   problem.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.160]   What we need is we need $30,000 to pay a college tuition bill."
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:16.960]   Well, your dad can just simply take out a $30,000 mortgage on the property.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.360]   He takes out a $30,000 mortgage.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:26.100]   Then he can give you $30,000 as a gift and then in time he will let his tenants pay down
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.800]   that mortgage again.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.480]   So then he can continue to own the property.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.760]   He gives you the gift.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.800]   You receive the gift of $30,000 tax-free.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.560]   The property stays in his name.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.040]   He continues to own it.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:43.080]   Then when he dies, the property receives a step-up in tax basis and you inherit the property
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.680]   at the higher level with no taxes due.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.540]   So that would be one way of accessing the equity in the property as well.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:54.480]   So it all depends on what do you need.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.080]   Is the property worth keeping?
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.300]   Do you need a lump sum of money?
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.200]   Do you need an income?
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.040]   Or is it better just we pay the tax and be done with it?
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.960]   But that's how I would analyze it.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.760]   >>Ted: Okay.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:15.240]   Yeah, I mean he's got the flexibility that he can give the money.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.440]   He doesn't have to get a mortgage for it.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:25.560]   He just thought this was going to kill two birds with one stone and get him out of it
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:38.040]   and while dealing with the cash flow and giving part of his estate to us two kids at the same
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.040]   time.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.080]   But without the step-up, it's...
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   Go ahead.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.080]   >>Steve: No.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.640]   Yeah, you're not going to get the step-up on a long-term capital gain asset until he
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.640]   dies and so you have to wait for his death to get the step-up.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.040]   So I guess just one more thing.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:00.080]   Again, you and he can decide whether all these moves are worth it and in the long-term best
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.880]   interest of him and you and the whole family because sometimes it's best just to go ahead
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.140]   and pay the bill and pay the tax bill.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:15.440]   But one other thing that you could do, just by way of example, are your children in the
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.480]   same town as this property?
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.880]   >>Ted: Two out of three.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   >>Steve: Okay.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.440]   >>Ted: Are in school here.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.440]   >>Steve: And are you in...
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.320]   You live in the same town as this property?
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   >>Ted: Yes.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320]   >>Steve: Okay.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.960]   >>Ted: About 30 minutes away, yeah.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.400]   >>Steve: So the other option that he could do...
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.560]   Let's say our number one most important goal is to avoid paying the tax.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.520]   We don't want to pay the capital gains taxes on the asset.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.520]   That's our goal.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:48.280]   Well, the other solution is if you say this particular property isn't a property that
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   he necessarily wants to keep owning but there might be another property that would be a
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:58.160]   better property, then he could do a 1031 exchange from this property into another property.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.520]   So let's say that what he actually says is, "This single family house is not the kind
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.480]   of property that I want to leave, but what I'd like to do is I'd like to buy a quadplex.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.080]   And the benefit of buying a quadplex that's here is I can get a good deal on one, and
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:19.400]   now my college-age grandchildren can use this as a component of their property management
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.400]   company."
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:25.560]   So yes, they'll be managing four tenants instead of one, but I want to do this because I want
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.520]   to help them to start to learn the property business, and my son's going to be partaking
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.840]   in it as well, and it'll be a good learning experience all around, a good business all
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.920]   around.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.840]   So what he does is he sells this property for $160,000.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:45.560]   He does a 1031 exchange of the $160,000 into the quad, and maybe this is the down payment
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:50.000]   on it, and then he continues to own the quad until his death.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.920]   Meanwhile, you and your children set up a property management company.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:59.480]   You manage the property in exchange for a percentage of the rents, so that allows you
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:06.000]   to gain income from the property, and then it also allows you to use this business as
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.360]   a way to shelter appropriate business expenses, et cetera.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.320]   Maybe you can get some other clients as well.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.520]   This allows you to get your feet wet and your children their feet wet in the rental business,
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.040]   and then he just simply leaves it to you in his will.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:26.400]   Now let's say he pays $300,000 for the quad, but it grows to be $400,000 at the time of
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.400]   his death.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.360]   Now you inherit the $400,000 quadruplex.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:36.880]   Maybe the mortgage is paid down by now, and you've received an increase from a tax-free
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:43.980]   increase from $100,000 to $400,000, and all of that gain, $300,000, is received by you
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.540]   income tax-free.
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.800]   You don't get the step-up in tax basis unless he owns it to the date of his death.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.760]   Your tools are, number one, take a mortgage against the property if he needs cash.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.560]   Mortgage because it's debt.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.760]   Mortgages always come to you with no income taxes.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.880]   And then with real estate, if it's profitably rented out, this is the best strategy because
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.480]   mortgages on real estate are low interest.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.360]   You can be fixed interest, and the tenant can pay them off.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:17.440]   You can deduct the interest expenses, et cetera, and/or use the property and set up a property
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:22.280]   management company and charge property management fees to take a little bit of the income off
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.280]   for your family.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.200]   Those are the most tax-efficient options that I can come up with for you.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   Okay.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   All right.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   Very good.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   My pleasure.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   Anything else?
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   Lots to think about.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   Thank you.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   Great.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   That'll do it.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   Okay.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.200]   Thank you.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   We move now to Jason in Kentucky.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   Jason, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.

[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:29.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:02.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:14.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:26.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:32.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.

[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:58.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.

[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:22.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:28.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:34.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:40.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:46.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:52.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:04.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:28.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:46.200]   And I'm going to be taking care of her.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.200]   - Okay, so let's talk about skillsets.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   Let's talk about skills, because that's probably a very accessible word.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.200]   So the skills would be business analytics and programming.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.200]   What other skills does that guy have that you don't currently have?
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.200]   - He'll sell skills.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.200]   That's one area I've been working on building myself in my current role.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.200]   And did a little bit of a road block, but yeah.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   What other skills?
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.200]   I guess if you're talking about management skills,
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.200]   I mean, most of the people are earning higher in some sort of
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.200]   management position, even if they're just managing a few people on a team.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.200]   Or like, what's it called?
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.200]   Project management, that's a skillset.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.200]   - Okay, good. Is there anything else that comes to mind?
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.200]   Anything else that he has that you don't have?
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   - I mean, I think I mentioned
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   competence, but I think that's part of it. Like communication skills.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   The phrase that's being thrown out a lot is executive presence.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:02.200]   Kind of that way of presenting yourself.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.200]   I guess it can be learned, but it's...
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   - Okay, so if we had more time,
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.200]   or if I were coaching you one-on-one, I would spend quite a bit of time with you
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:18.200]   asking you about what you're doing for these things.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   And asking you what you're doing, etc. Because of this format, I'm just going to give you
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   some things that I want you to think about and some homework to do. So grab a pen,
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.200]   so you are ready. So this is a good list of things. And by way of reminder,
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.200]   we've said business analytics skills. The ability to look at a business
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.200]   and analyze it. The ability to look at a spreadsheet and analyze what's happening with the numbers.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.200]   Programming skills. The ability to actually do a technical function of programming.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.200]   Sales skills. The ability to close more sales and to close bigger sales.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.200]   Management skills. The ability to manage and inspire people
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.200]   to a higher level of collective performance.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:58.200]   Project management. The ability to bring a project to fruition
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.200]   in a quick and efficient way. And confidence. Personal confidence,
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:06.200]   executive presence, and communications skills.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.200]   The key thing to recognize is that every single one of those things
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.200]   is a skill. It's not something that's
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   inborn in a human being. You don't, you know, when my
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:22.200]   son came out of the womb, I didn't look down and say,
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   "Oh look, he's a programmer." Right? No, programming is a learned skill.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.200]   You don't look at a little child and say, "Oh, look, they've just got such an executive
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.200]   presence." Executive presence is something that is trained. It's a skill.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.200]   And the key thing is, any skill
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.200]   that somebody else has learned is a skill that you can learn
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.200]   as well. Now, maybe somebody else learned it easier
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.200]   than you did, or than you can, because they have a
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.200]   better starting place, maybe they're smarter than you are, maybe their parents
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.200]   loved them more than yours did, or maybe they started out behind and they had
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   to work twice as hard as you do to learn something. But any skill
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   that somebody else has learned is a skill that you can learn.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   And if you want to increase your income, the simplest
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.200]   and the easiest way for you to start is to start by analyzing
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   the people that are in your company. Look at who is
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.200]   making more in your company, and then try to figure out
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.200]   how do I develop the skills that they have
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.200]   that I don't currently have. And then go to work on them
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.200]   little by little by little by little. Now, there are other
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.200]   great career strategies that you can employ as well,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:42.200]   but the simplest one is just simply look at the people that are in your company.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.200]   You have a boss, you have a job, you have a work environment that you know. Look at them
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.200]   and analyze what skills they have. And so here is your homework.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.200]   The first thing that I would strongly encourage you to do
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:58.200]   is to choose one person to start with, but ultimately choose a half a dozen
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   people in your company that are your superiors. They're your superiors
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   whether they're direct superiors or somewhere else, but choose people
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.200]   in your company that you admire. Don't choose the person you don't like, but choose the guy that you
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.200]   admire that you know works well
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:18.200]   and that you know has skills that you don't have and that you know is making
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.200]   more money. Choose people that are making in your company $100,000
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.200]   and ask them for lunch and say, "Would you be willing to have lunch with me?"
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.200]   And take them out for lunch. They'll all say yes. It's no big deal. So you take them out
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.200]   for lunch and specifically say, "I am working hard
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   on developing my skills and I really want to develop
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.200]   more confidence. I really want to be able to progress in my
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   skills at the company.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   I want to be able to move on in my career. What advice
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.200]   do you have for me? How did you get..." A good question to start
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.200]   with is, "How did you get where you are? Where did you start from and how did you get
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:02.200]   where you are?" And ask them what they did to get where they
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   are because if they started out as we all do
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   as little children not knowing anything, but over time they did
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   a certain set of things. Maybe they got a degree. Maybe they didn't
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   get a degree. Maybe they took a certain job. Maybe they didn't. Maybe they read a book. Maybe they took a class. Whatever they did.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   If they can tell you how they got where they are
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.200]   and then you do what they did, then it goes
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.200]   to reason that you'll get where they are in
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:34.200]   time. But they'll give you much better advice than that. So ask them,
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:38.200]   "How did you get where you are and what would you recommend that I do to develop the
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.200]   skills that I need to succeed in a job like yours?"
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.200]   And so ask them more questions. They'll give you answers, but take notes.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:50.200]   They might suggest that you read a certain book. You know, "This book here on this kind
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.200]   of programming is the key book." Or, "I took this class on accounting
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.200]   and it really helped me to understand how to read a business balance sheet." Or,
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   "You should go to this sales seminar or listen to this sales podcast." Or,
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:06.200]   "Here's how I learned management skills," etc. And ask them for their
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:10.200]   advice and then make notes of it. And the secret is do what
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.200]   they said. So if they say, "Oh, read this certain book,"
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:18.200]   you immediately go home. You order the book. You read it. And then
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.200]   two weeks later, you go back to them and you say, "I read the book that you gave me.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.200]   Would you be willing to go to lunch with me again? I'd like to talk to you about it and
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.200]   ask you some questions from it." Then two weeks later, you go to lunch. And you
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   bring the book with you, which you've marked up, you've highlighted, you've underlined,
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.200]   you've written your questions in it, and you've said, "Here's what I thought was really good,"
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.200]   or, "Here are the questions that you have," and you have a conversation with them about the book.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.200]   And then you ask them, "What should I do next?" And they say, "You should go take this class."
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:50.200]   So you go take the class. And then you come back a month later, take them to lunch, go to lunch
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   with them, etc. And you start to build this relationship with them. And you do
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   what they tell you to do to learn the skills that they have learned.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   And what happens is, this does a few things. Number one, it starts you on the
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   process of developing the skills that you need to succeed in your job.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.200]   You read the book on programming, you write the program. You read the book on
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:14.200]   sales skills or go to the seminar, and then you start implementing some of the techniques in your
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   business. But you're doing it with someone that's in your company that
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.200]   knows the things that work in your company and the things that don't work in your company.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.200]   For example, just as an aside,
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.200]   I used to want to learn how to sell. And so I would read these books on sales.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.200]   But the problem was that I was in the life insurance business. And so I was reading these books on
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.200]   life insurance sales. And a lot of the people would talk about the importance
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.200]   of what in sales world is called the "one-call close," where
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.200]   what you do is you pressure somebody to make a decision, either a yes or a no decision,
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.200]   and you pressure them to make a decision
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:54.200]   on the first call. You don't call back and try to make another call. You do it right
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.200]   there. But I quickly learned that that was completely the wrong advice
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.200]   for the type of business that we did. And I learned I never,
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.200]   I never sold on the first close. Never. Because
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.200]   what would happen is, the market that we were in was so totally different
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.200]   that if I sold on the first close, it was guaranteed to be
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:18.200]   terrible business. The stuff that we did was always something where I
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.200]   wanted somebody to take a significant amount of time to think about it and really be
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.200]   sure about what they were doing. It had to make sense. And so closing on the first
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.200]   call may have worked in 1952 when this one guy was selling a
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.200]   $322 life insurance policy, but it was not the right advice in
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   2010. And so somebody in your industry would quickly say, "No,
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.200]   no, no, you don't do that." And so you're getting the right advice from people who are in your
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   industry, and they're steering you towards the type of programming or the type of business
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   analytics or the type of sales skills that are helping you. You're also building
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.200]   a mentoring relationship, and you're bringing yourself to the attention of those who
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.200]   are in leadership in the company. People who are in leadership of the company are
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.200]   desperate to find good employees. They're desperate to find people to replace
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.200]   themselves. Because this guy who's making $100,000, he can't move
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.200]   up until he can find and cultivate his replacement. That's his job. If you want to move
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.200]   up in a company, your job is to figure out who's going to replace you so that you
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.200]   can move up and be promoted yourself. And so you're putting yourself on the radar screen
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.200]   as a hard worker, as an active go-getter, and as a learner, and as
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.200]   somebody who's coachable and teachable and trainable. And that's what every coach
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.200]   wants. That's what every company wants, is employees who are coachable, teachable, and trainable.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.200]   And so the process of simply asking for help and asking for advice has the
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   major benefit of raising your profile and allowing you to be a mentee
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.200]   of the leaders in your company. And within a company, this is a totally
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.200]   natural and normal function if you just simply take initiative.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   So the first piece of homework for you is schedule a lunch appointment at least
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.200]   once per week with somebody in your company that you
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.200]   admire. Now, if it's the senior executive vice
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   president, and I don't know how big your company is, and they don't want to take you for lunch, at least
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.200]   say, "Listen, would you be willing to have a few minutes? I'd like to get some advice from you."
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:10.200]   I have done this over the years again and again, and I have never had anybody
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.200]   say no. Even at the most, the highest levels.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.200]   Because people who are successful and highly successful respect
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   people who are willing to take a risk
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.200]   and ask for help. I always think of it like this. Think back to when you were in high school
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.200]   and how hard it was, probably for you, to ask a girl out.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.200]   Now today, being 39 years old, you look at that and say, "That's ridiculous."
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:38.200]   The most obvious thing in the world would have been just simply to be the
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.200]   kind of guy who asked the girl out. And by simply behaving in a confident way,
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.200]   if you went back to high school, you'd kill it with the girls because you'd just ask them out. There would be no fear.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.200]   But you in high school had the problem of thinking that it mattered
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.200]   if she said no somehow. But you at 39, you know that's a bunch of bunk.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.200]   It's the same thing in business. When you simply ask for help and you ask for advice, and you go right
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.200]   to the top, the guy at the top knows that that's the key skill and is
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.200]   happy to help you. So homework one, schedule a lunch appointment. Plan it at least
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:10.200]   once a week. You should, by the way, if you run out of people in your company,
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.200]   you should do exactly the same thing with people that you know in your industry or that
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.200]   you know in your life. Start with a friend of yours, an older person
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.200]   that you know and respect. If you have a competitor at another company
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.200]   that you met at some company function or something like that, ask them to lunch.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:30.200]   Ask them their advice. And if you practice simply being a good student, that will
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:34.200]   help raise your profile at your job. The second piece of advice I would have for you
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.200]   specifically because you said that confidence has been a challenge for you
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.200]   and that you need more confidence, more executive presence,
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.200]   and more communication skills. You need to join Toastmasters International.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.200]   Toastmasters International is the single
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:54.200]   best way for you to develop personal confidence,
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:58.200]   executive presence, communication skills,
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.200]   and management skills. You must join Toastmasters
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.200]   International and participate in what they do. And let me explain to you why
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.200]   Toastmasters is such a tremendous opportunity.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   Number one. I've done that in a long
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.200]   time, but I need to rejoin Toastmasters. Yeah, rejoin.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.200]   Rejoin and make it a practice. And probably what you should do is take it beyond
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   just speaking if you didn't take it before. Let me explain
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.200]   how Toastmasters works, especially for people who have never done it. The basic
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   concept of Toastmasters is to collect a group of people who are
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:38.200]   all friendly with one another and encouraging who want to learn how to speak in public.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.200]   Speaking in public is the number one fear that many people
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:46.200]   have. And yet it's also one of the most important skills that you can have
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.200]   in both career advancement, right? There's nobody who's an executive
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.200]   of your company that would be uncomfortable standing
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:58.200]   up at a big meeting and saying, "Hey, here's what I think." So it's important for career advancement,
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.200]   but it's also important for self-confidence. If you can tackle the number
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:06.200]   one fear that many people have, and you can learn to deal with that
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.200]   fear, to act in spite of that fear, and in time to eliminate that fear,
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.200]   it'll do tremendous amounts of good for your personal
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   self-confidence. And so they do that by giving you a speaking curriculum and
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.200]   you're learning how to speak. The process of going through the
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   curriculum that Toastmasters offers of learning how to speak in public
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.200]   and learning how to do it in the way they do it in the clubs, and for those
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.200]   who've never been to the clubs, some of it is with prepared speeches, you prepare a five-minute
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.200]   speech. Some of it is with extemporaneous speaking, where you just simply stand
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.200]   and speak on a question that's asked to you. That process will help you to
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:46.200]   develop executive presence. Also, you serve in all of the roles
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.200]   of the meeting. So you may have never chaired an important meeting at your job,
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.200]   but at Toastmasters you will chair a meeting, and they'll evaluate you
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:58.200]   at the end of the meeting on how you did, and they'll evaluate you on your executive presence.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.200]   And you learn how to stand still in front of a room, how to take control of a room,
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.200]   how to order a meeting, etc. All of that will contribute to your executive presence.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:10.200]   The process of going through it in a friendly environment will build your self-confidence.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:14.200]   The process of preparing and delivering speeches, both pre-planned
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:18.200]   prepared speeches and speaking extemporaneously,
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.200]   will help you to build your communication skills. And then the major
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.200]   secret of Toastmasters is this. Once you go
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   through the basic level of communications training,
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.200]   you can move into the management track. And they have
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.200]   both a communications track, where you can become a skilled professional
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.200]   public speaker, if that were your ambition, but they also have a management track,
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   where you start by working as the treasurer of a club, or
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.200]   the secretary of a club. But then you can move on to be the president of your local
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.200]   club. Maybe there's 15 people in your local club, but you now have the chance to be the president
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.200]   of your local club of 15 people. Now,
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.200]   do you think that that experience of managing a club
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.200]   of 15 people, who are all positive, optimistic, want to support you
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.200]   when you make mistakes, etc. Do you think that that could help you to develop management
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.200]   skills that can be applied in your workspace?
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.200]   Yes, definitely. And here's the thing. Toastmasters gives
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:22.200]   you a manual on everything that you need to do to become
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.200]   a competent treasurer, or a competent secretary, or a competent manager of a local
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.200]   club. And then once you serve as the president of your local club for a year,
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:34.200]   and you have a manual on everything to do, and all of those things directly translate over
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:38.200]   to your business, to your job, then you become a manager of a
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.200]   region, and you can become the manager of a huge region if you want.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.200]   Which, that's the kind of skill that now you're going and, for example, they give
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.200]   you projects. Like one of the projects you would do at one point would be to host a regional
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:54.200]   conference. And so there'll be a regional conference of 100 speakers
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.200]   coming together, and you'll be the organizer of that conference. Certainly, you're
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.200]   volunteering your time. Certainly it's going to take several hours a week for you.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.200]   But once you've put together a regional conference and hosted a regional conference for
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.200]   100 competitors, and there's 700 people that come to
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:14.200]   your meeting, and you're standing up in front of the room of 700 people, that
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:18.200]   will help you to build those management skills, and that will translate over
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   to your job. So for you, my two things are this. One,
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.200]   do homework assignments of scheduling at least one meeting a lunch, one
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.200]   lunch meeting a week, with somebody that you admire, that you look up to, who makes
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.200]   more money than you do, and who is farther ahead
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.200]   in their career than you are. Ask them for their advice, and then do
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   what they tell you to do. And then number two, join Toastmasters, go through the
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.200]   communications track, and then get involved in the club management track to build those executive
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.200]   management skills.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.200]   I've got a lunch meeting already scheduled on Tuesday, so
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.200]   I'm getting started there. Good. Take a notebook and ask for advice.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.200]   Jason, thank you for calling in. Congratulations on the birth of your baby, and I'm really glad that you're here, and I appreciate
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.200]   your listening. Yeah, thanks, Josh. All right, we finish
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   out today with Shiv in Washington. Shiv, welcome
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.200]   to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.200]   Hey, Josh. Thanks for taking my call, and of course, thanks
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:22.200]   for everything, especially your recent episode on how to read books. It has
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.200]   helped me a lot. Good. With the
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:30.200]   question, in short, I have some confusion about how
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.200]   to diversify investment distribution between stock
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.200]   position and real estate. A bit of detail,
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:42.200]   I have a mortgage balance, and I have a single
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.200]   stock exposure in my portfolio in excess of a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:50.200]   The stock has done really well in recent past, but I'm concerned
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.200]   now due to the market wipe and
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:58.200]   recession is coming, all those sort of things.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.200]   I'm confused. Should I sell my stock or I
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.200]   mortgage, or should I keep holding the stock more, which
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.200]   has done phenomenal for me?
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:14.200]   How do I decide? I know I'm alluding to market
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   timing here, but it's making me restless these days,
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   and I also know that this is an appropriate question for a financial
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.200]   advisor, but I'm trying to learn that process to do myself
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.200]   DIY, and I would like to know how
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.200]   financial advisor thinks about it.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.200]   So, the first thing is you should pay
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:42.200]   attention to the fact that you're feeling restless. One of the
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:46.200]   things that I don't like is when people think that they should ignore
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.200]   how they feel about, especially when it results in your money, because at the end of the
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.200]   day, it's your money, and you're the one who cares more than anybody else what happens
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:58.200]   with it. And so, if you feel concerned and you feel restless
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   about something, you should pay attention to that. Doesn't necessarily mean you should sell,
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.200]   it just means you should pay attention. And you gotta go back and analyze that and say
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:10.200]   why do I feel restless? Am I exposed here?
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:14.200]   Have I made a bad decision? Or is this just simply an emotional
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.200]   response to the news that I'm taking in, and I need to go back and look, what's my
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   core strategy? What do I own? Why do I own it? How confident do I feel
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.200]   about the future of this, etc.? And go with that process
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   there. But you need to start by homing in on why do you actually feel
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.200]   restless and analyze that. So, do you have a clear plan
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.200]   that you are pursuing to...
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:42.200]   Do you have a clear plan that you're pursuing at this point in time?
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.200]   So, in short, my plan is to
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.200]   pay down the mortgage and have
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.200]   a chance to reach my 4% goal and then
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.200]   move out of job and do
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:02.200]   the gigs. I haven't decided what the gigs are.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.200]   But right now I'm in a good place.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:10.200]   My sole purpose from that income is to
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.200]   pay down my debt. The only debt I have is mortgage and build
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:18.200]   portfolio. So, you mentioned real estate.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:22.200]   Why are you attracted to investing in real estate?
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:26.200]   Real estate...
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:30.200]   Right now, real estate is my house. So, I'm not like
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:34.200]   I have done research on real estate or something. It's just that I have bought a
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:38.200]   house, so that's why I...
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:42.200]   Okay. We're having a little bit of
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.200]   connection issue, which is making it a little bit hard to hear
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:50.200]   everything you're saying.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.200]   The question that you're asking is fundamentally unanswerable
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:58.200]   because you don't have a specific scenario that you're presenting.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.200]   I don't know whether stocks are going to go up or whether stocks are going to go down.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.200]   I don't know whether we're going to go into a deep,
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:10.200]   dark, long, hard recession and depression for the next
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.200]   10 years or we're going to go into
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.200]   the next greatest thing. Every politician wants me to believe one extreme or the other.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.200]   I don't know. I don't know what investment strategy
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   you should pursue in stocks or if you should pursue a strategy of real
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.200]   estate, etc. I don't know. But what I do know is that
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.200]   you can work your way through the scenarios by thinking them through
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.200]   and then comparing those scenarios to your current
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.200]   plans and to your current strategy. So, the first
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.200]   thing I would look at is what are my goals? What are my ultimate
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.200]   goals that I'm trying to work towards with my finances?
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.200]   What am I trying to fund? Now, you mentioned that you're trying to fund financial independence.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.200]   I would say, "What does financial independence mean to me?" You've got a number. That's what
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.200]   you've calculated, etc. I would ask myself, "What would I do when I
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:06.200]   hit that number? Is there any way that I can get there faster?"
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.200]   If you are well-employed at a job that you like and your
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:14.200]   primary strategy for hitting financial independence is to own stocks
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:18.200]   and your number is a few years out and you have
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.200]   an investment plan that is solid, then you don't worry about the market
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:26.200]   going down because the market's going to go down. That's what happens. You get a 30%
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.200]   correction every decade. You get a 15% correction every
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.200]   downturn every year. You get a 50% correction every couple decades. That's what's going to happen.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:38.200]   And so, you know that I'm going to be in a situation where
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:42.200]   I'm going to keep working. I've got a job that's fine. I'm saving lots of money.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:46.200]   And what I would be doing if my stocks went down is I would buy, buy, buy, buy. There's no reason
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:50.200]   for you to be nervous in that kind of situation. Now, if on the other hand, your
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.200]   financial independence plan is to quit your job, buy a bed and breakfast
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:58.200]   in the smoky mountains, or buy a... You're in Washington.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.200]   Buy a bed and breakfast with a beautiful view of Mount Olympia,
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   then I would be really nervous about owning stocks because if
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.200]   my portfolio goes down by 30%, and that means I can't
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.200]   buy my bed and breakfast like I've been planning to, I'm really nervous about
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.200]   that plan. So, if I were in that situation, I would sell my stocks. I would
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.200]   say I'm not worried about getting the maximum return. I'm worried about
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.200]   getting to the next stage in my plan. Same thing if I were trying to buy
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.200]   real estate. If you're trying to move into real estate because you're convinced that real estate is a better fit
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:34.200]   for your personality or that you can make more money in real estate or that there's more leverage
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.200]   opportunities, etc., then I would adjust
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.200]   my portfolio. Back to your stocks. You look at your stocks and you say
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.200]   is this a fair value? If you're buying single stocks, you
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:50.200]   look down and company A is at $50 a share.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.200]   You ask yourself, would I buy this company again at $50 a
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:58.200]   share? And if you would, then you keep it. If you wouldn't, then you sell.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.200]   So, everything is going to be based on your strategy. The key thing is to have
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.200]   total clarity about your goals and then
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.200]   have as much clarity as you can about your plans and then all these
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:14.200]   decisions are fairly simple and straightforward.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   That makes sense.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.200]   Here's what I would do if I were you. Here's the homework I would give you.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.200]   Spend some time articulating as clearly as
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:30.200]   possible your specific financial goals.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:34.200]   What you're trying to achieve. Ask yourself the why questions.
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:38.200]   Why is this important to me? And spend some time journaling those things out.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.200]   Then, as you have your goals, sit down, put on some soft
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:46.200]   gentle music, meditation music or whatever you want to. Lie down or sit down
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:50.200]   in a comfortable chair and envision yourself having fully
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.200]   achieved those goals. And then work backwards in your mind
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:58.200]   and say how did I get here? How did I get there from here?
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.200]   What did I do? And build the plan step by step
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   by step in your mind.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.200]   When you've done that, write it down and organize it and then it should be fairly clear.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.200]   When I left the financial advice
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.200]   business, I sold all my stocks and
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.200]   among other reasons, one of the reasons I did that was because I didn't care
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.200]   what my returns were going to be 30 years from now.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:30.200]   I was in the middle of a course correction. I could see very clearly in my head
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.200]   what I wanted to build. I knew. I'd gone through all
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:38.200]   the exercises that I teach. I knew what I would do if I won $10 million tax free
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.200]   in a lottery. I knew the kind of life and the lifestyle that I would build.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.200]   And I sat down and I thought it through and for me at that stage, owning stocks was
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.200]   totally meaningless. Whereas having cash was incredibly important.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   And so I moved everything to cash so I would have the maximum cash available
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.200]   to me to make the various lifestyle moves that I wanted to make.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.200]   Now, I executed that plan. I accomplished that plan.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.200]   It took me longer than I thought, but I made the complete change that I had
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.200]   and today the life that I live is exactly what I sat down and I imagined
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.200]   5, 6, 7, 8 years ago. It's exactly like that.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:18.200]   Now, I'm still enhancing and going from here, but at this point everything has changed
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.200]   where now the stocks are not a
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.200]   key thing. So now when I sit down as I look at my portfolio, I'm not worried about
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.200]   my portfolio creating income for me. Now I want my portfolio to create impact.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.200]   And so I sit and I think, how do I create impact with my portfolio?
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:38.200]   And I imagine, what do I want to do? What is my goal?
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.200]   If I'm going to be the steward of this money, what is the goal of this money?
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   Why is it in my hands and what am I doing with it? And so I'm working hard to build
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.200]   the clear vision of the impact of the money that I
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:54.200]   manage and then to try to see what are the paths that I can
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.200]   proceed through to make the impact that I ultimately want to make.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:02.200]   I don't have it perfectly figured out, but I can confidently answer
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:06.200]   for me, just for me personally, I don't care about the stock market.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.200]   I will never create the impact that I want to create by simply owning
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:14.200]   stocks and publicly traded companies. And so it's very obvious to me
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:18.200]   that for my goals, the stock market is completely immaterial.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.200]   But that comes from sitting down, getting a very clear
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.200]   picture of where you're going, and then doing your best to imagine your way through
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.200]   the process of how you think you're ultimately going to get there.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.200]   So that's how I would tackle it if I were you.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   That makes perfect sense. Thank you so much.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.200]   Do I have some more time to ask some corollary questions
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:46.200]   on real estate? Let's do it quickly. Yeah, I got about five minutes or so.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.200]   So go ahead. And if not, we can pick it up next week.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.200]   Number one, with the recent interest rates going down,
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.200]   how to decide between whether to refinance or not?
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.200]   And the second one, should I treat my home mortgage
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:04.200]   equivalent to other investments? Should it be
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:08.200]   a real estate investment or should I treat it something different?
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:12.200]   Number one, how to decide whether to refinance or not. You go and you get
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.200]   a quote on refinancing your mortgage. And you get
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:20.200]   that quote as best you can. You get the best information that you can from
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:24.200]   a couple of mortgage brokers. And you do your best to find out
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.200]   what the full costs of a refinance would be. And then you make a spreadsheet.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   You take your current mortgage. You put it into a spreadsheet.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:36.200]   All of the costs, etc. And then you get your new mortgage estimate.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.200]   Any closing costs, refinancing costs. And you make an amortization
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.200]   schedule for both of them. And then you analyze that amortization schedule
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:48.200]   to see where your break-even point is. And you
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.200]   look at it and you say, "How long if I make this, because there's going to
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:56.200]   be costs to refinance a mortgage, how long would it take me to recoup
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.200]   these costs?" And in some cases, the answer is, "By
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:04.200]   13 months from now, I'll recoup this. And my situation will be better because
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:08.200]   I'll have a lower payment. I'll have a lower total interest cost. I'll have more free cash flow that I can invest
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:12.200]   into other things." In some cases, it'll be 17 years. "I'm not going to
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.200]   do that. I'm probably not even going to be in the house 17 years." And so you sit tight. But the answer
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.200]   is a spreadsheet. Number two, should you look at your house as
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:24.200]   a real estate investment or as a personal lifestyle investment?
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.200]   Are you married? Do you have children? - Yes, I am married
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:32.200]   and I have one son. - Okay. So if you are married and you have children,
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:36.200]   then that's going to generally push you, if your wife is
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:40.200]   anything like most women, that's going to push you in the direction of saying,
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.200]   "This is my home where we live and this is where my family lives."
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:48.200]   Now, that's not to say you shouldn't make changes, but I'm not going to try
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:52.200]   to milk every dollar that I can out of my house. Right? How many
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:56.200]   bedrooms does your house have? - Three. - Three.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.200]   And so you could, if you wanted to,
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:04.200]   you could move your children into the master bedroom, put their beds in
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.200]   there with you and your wife, and you could rent two of your other bedrooms out to
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.200]   borders to make maximum money. You could do that, right?
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.200]   But you don't, right? Because you're not trying to get as rich as you can
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:20.200]   out of your house. You're sitting there and saying, "This is my home. This is where we live."
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:24.200]   And so you're trying to build a home. Now,
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:28.200]   what I find is that my tolerance for discomfort
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:32.200]   and for lack of lifestyle
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:36.200]   freedom was much higher when I was younger and when I was single than it is
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.200]   now. I'm much more willing to give up money in favor of
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:44.200]   atmosphere and comfort at this stage of my life than I was when I was 20.
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.200]   And so the key for 20-year-olds is to rent every bedroom out of your house and you sleep
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:52.200]   in your pickup truck in the garage and make as much money as you can because that's not
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.200]   going to be the long-term
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:00.200]   environment that you're in once you're married and you have children.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:04.200]   So unless your house is costing you something important,
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:08.200]   assuming that you live in a reasonable house, you're still able to save and invest, you're still making
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:12.200]   progress towards those goals, etc., then you just simply view it as a home.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:16.200]   And you own that home in as cost-efficient as a way as you can figure out how
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:20.200]   to do. But I don't put it down as real estate. I just put it down as a home.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:24.200]   That said, there's no reason not to make an intelligent decision along the way. So if you can buy
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:28.200]   in an area where you think there's going to be good long-term appreciation, buy
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:32.200]   in an area where you think there's going to be good long-term appreciation. If you can finance your home
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.200]   at a really inexpensive, with a really inexpensive plan, do that.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.200]   You don't have to be financially stupid, but I don't consider it a real estate
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:44.200]   investment. I consider it a home. Got it. Makes sense.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:48.200]   Makes sense. Thank you very much. Good question, Shiv. I really enjoyed them.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:52.200]   And I thank you very much for calling in.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:56.200]   Good questions today. I hope you guys enjoyed this. I guess I would say in closing
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:00.200]   here that the number one thing is always going
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:04.200]   to come down to goals. The longer and longer that I have done
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:08.200]   financial planning, the more scenarios I have worked in, what I have
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:12.200]   realized is if you have total clarity about
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:16.200]   what you're trying to do, the answers are relatively
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.200]   clear. The answers are relatively obvious.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.200]   But if you're not sure what you're trying to do, then you can't... it's hard
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.200]   to know what's the best path forward.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:32.200]   So more and more when I face a difficult decision in my life
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:36.200]   and I realize that I'm in a situation where I don't know what to do,
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:40.200]   I try to go back and do whatever work I can do to gain more clarity
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:44.200]   on the path, on what I'm trying to do, and then consider
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:48.200]   my options in light of that.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.200]   You can come up with your own analogies to prove that point.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:56.200]   But as you hear, as you listen to me answer these questions, just always hear the tone.
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:00.200]   Hear what comes through. If somebody has a clear goal, the path
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.200]   there is fairly simple. If somebody doesn't have a clear goal, we're not
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:08.200]   sure which way to go. So spend your time getting clarity on the goal.
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:12.200]   And I hope that helps you. I've gotten really great feedback
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.200]   about these calls because I know it's so helpful to hear other people wrestle with things and you think, "Oh, that makes my situation
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:20.200]   obvious." I would love to speak to you on next week's call.

[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.200]   During the Coming Economic Crisis." I just posted an update to my students in that
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:56.200]   "Survive and Thrive" course about my experiences. I've completed
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.200]   all of my phase one of my own plans to
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.200]   survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis. I was pleasantly surprised.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:08.200]   All the recommendations that I made actually worked out better than I thought they would before I did them.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:12.200]   You can find all of that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
