[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.080]   - Happy Monday.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.240]   Today is Labor Day for many of us,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.240]   a day when we rest from our work
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.920]   and think of, well, just about anything but work.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.840]   But here we are talking about work, actually,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.640]   and we're doing it because a number of you
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.520]   have emailed over the years
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.280]   wanting to know about work in eternity.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.640]   Here's one version of that email
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.720]   from a listener named Steve.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.080]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.520]   I have a question about work in heaven
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.240]   or work in the new creation, to be more exact.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.600]   First, will we work in the new creation?
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.760]   And if so, what types of vocations will be needed?
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.020]   Does the Bible give us any hints here?
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.480]   And if we work, do you think this future vocation
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.920]   will resonate with or consummate some gifting
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.960]   that we always felt drawn to express here on Earth,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.600]   whether or not we could make money doing it here?
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.440]   And if you answer yes to all of this,
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.560]   put on your hat of prediction.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.840]   What will you be doing in eternity?
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.520]   - Let's start with what we know for sure
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.120]   about the eternal future that all those,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   all of us who are in Christ will definitely enjoy.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.000]   Jesus said that we will be with him.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.100]   We will see his glory.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.840]   We will have the capacity to love him
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.800]   with the very love that the Father has for him.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   That's John 17, 24 to 26.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.080]   The apostle John tells us in his first letter
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.400]   in the third chapter, we will see him
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.040]   and we will be like him.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.740]   And that includes both sinless purity of heart
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.200]   and the glory of our new resurrection bodies,
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.040]   according to Philippians 3.21.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.200]   And then Revelation 21,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.360]   John tells us that God will wipe away
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.540]   every tear from our eyes and death will be no more.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.560]   Neither shall there be mourning
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.840]   nor crying nor pain anymore.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.600]   And then Psalm 16, 11 twists that around
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.200]   and makes it positive, namely in God's presence,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.400]   we will have fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.480]   Now that is for sure.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   Now, the question is, will work be part of our experience
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.320]   of that eternal joy in God's presence?
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   And I think the answer is yes,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.400]   but I say that not because the Bible
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.640]   has decisive statements to that effect,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.520]   but because there are significant pointers
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.420]   in that direction.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.540]   So I wouldn't elevate this conviction
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.500]   that I'm gonna argue for here to a top level doctrine,
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.640]   but rather call it a reasonable, probable hope.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.740]   And if not this, then something way better.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.700]   I mean, if it turns out it won't be what you think
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.220]   you thought it was, it's gonna be better
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.460]   because we know there'll be no sorrow there,
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.900]   no regret, no frustration, no disappointment
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.100]   with God's decisions about what our happiness
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.340]   should look like.
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.980]   So here are my six pointers,
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.340]   and then I'll end with a caution.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.700]   Number one, and these are pointers for why we can
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.700]   be relatively confident there will be work for us to do
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.060]   in the age to come, in our eternity with God.
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.580]   Number one, God himself is a worker,
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.740]   and we will be more like him then, not less,
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.540]   than we are now.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.540]   Genesis 2:2, "On the seventh day, God finished his work
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.720]   that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.200]   from all the work that he had done."
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.060]   And Jesus said in John 5:17, "My father is working
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.580]   until now, and I am working."
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.380]   So God is a worker.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.380]   Number two, God created man to be a worker
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.680]   before the fall into sin.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.860]   The curse that fell on man after the fall was not work,
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.060]   but futile work, miserable work, sweaty work
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.060]   that makes us hate it, want to play instead of working.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.540]   But God made man from the beginning to work the world,
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.060]   shape the world, Genesis 1:28.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.060]   And God blessed him, blessed them, and God said to them,
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.180]   "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.960]   and have dominion over the fish of the sea
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.700]   and over the birds of the heavens
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.820]   and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.820]   And then Genesis 2:15, "The Lord God took the man
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.980]   and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it."
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.860]   Number three, the parable that describes
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.500]   how Jesus settles accounts with his servants
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   at the second coming suggests that now that Jesus has come,
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.000]   they will have work given them to do.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   In Luke 19:17, the master says, "Well done, good servant,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.080]   because you have been faithful in a very little,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.800]   you shall have authority over 10 cities."
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.320]   Now, whether that's parabolic or metaphorical,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.360]   it may well point to the fact something like that,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.720]   we will be given responsibility in the age to come.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.960]   Number four, according to Ephesians 2:10,
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   we are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.760]   for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.280]   that we should walk in them.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.360]   When Paul identified a purpose
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.840]   for the new creature in Christ, us,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.920]   he said the purpose was work, good works.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   Number five, Isaiah 65, 17 to 25 describes the new heavens
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.280]   and the new earth to include work.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.440]   Verses 21 following go like this,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.840]   "They shall build houses and inhabit them.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   They shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.980]   My chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.620]   They shall not labor in vain
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.260]   or bear children for calamity."
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.220]   Now, the reason I say this is only a pointer,
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.060]   not a decisive statement,
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.040]   even though it may look like that,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.560]   about work in the final state,
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.100]   is that there is serious disagreement
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.100]   about whether this passage in Isaiah 65
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.280]   is a description of our final state,
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.060]   because it speaks of bearing children.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.140]   And Jesus said that in the final state,
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.880]   there would be no marriage
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.900]   and presumably no bearing of children.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.700]   And in the age to come, we're not gonna experience death.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.740]   And yet verse 20 says, "A young man will die
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.700]   a hundred years old in the new creation."
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.340]   We know there is no death in the age to come.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.940]   So what the disagreement is,
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.940]   is whether those kinds of statements here in Isaiah 65
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.340]   are somehow metaphorical for eternal life
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.080]   in the age to come,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.240]   which I have never been able to understand
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.620]   how death is a symbol for life,
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.620]   or whether this is a description of a millennial period
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.700]   after the second coming,
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.380]   which is much higher in its blessing,
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.820]   a higher level than presently in blessing than now,
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.180]   but not yet the final stage of the new heavens
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.820]   and the new earth.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.340]   And that would be my view.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.020]   But in either case,
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.120]   whether those are metaphorical statements
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.660]   and that we will be working in the final state,
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.620]   or whether this is a next stage of redemptive history
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.540]   in which, yes, there will be work
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.500]   and maybe pointing to the fact
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.020]   that there's work in the final state,
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.260]   it seems to me that we can't settle that
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.860]   with enough certainty to persuade
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.940]   all the evangelicals who love the Bible.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.220]   I mean, I've got a lot of good friends
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.120]   that disagree with me on this.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.260]   And so I don't call those verses in Isaiah 65
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.720]   a decisive, precise statement
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.460]   that there will be work in the final state,
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.220]   but it seems to me it points in that direction.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.500]   Number six, when you take sin out of the heart
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.660]   and out of the world,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.600]   which will happen in the age to come,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   the line between work and play becomes almost invisible.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.020]   What is play?
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.420]   When all our work will be totally enjoyable.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.220]   I mean, totally.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.380]   There is no work now that is totally enjoyable.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.180]   All work has some element to it
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.360]   we find frustrating or disappointing
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.960]   or futile or discouraging.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.500]   Perhaps, this is speculation,
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.500]   perhaps there will be sweet weariness of mind and body,
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.440]   new body getting weary in the age to come
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   that needs something different than its usual occupation,
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.320]   namely rest and play.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.160]   I don't know, because work itself
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.160]   will be so profoundly satisfying and sweet and enjoyable.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.600]   Nobody will say, "I need a weekend.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.560]   "I gotta have some playtime,"
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.580]   because everything will be as happy and satisfying as play,
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.760]   but there may be a difference.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.100]   And that word, perhaps,
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.380]   I mean, I've been using the word perhaps all along,
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.900]   leads me to wrap up with a caution
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.740]   about making more precise statements
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.660]   about the age to come
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.140]   than the Bible gives us warrant to make.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.860]   There are cautions in the Bible that remind us
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.420]   the glories of the age to come
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.800]   are going to be beyond
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.120]   our present comprehension and imagination.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.620]   2 Corinthians 12, 4, Paul said,
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.200]   "He saw things in heaven that no man can utter."
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.180]   1 Corinthians 2, 9, Paul says that,
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.840]   "God has prepared things for those who love him
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.300]   "that are beyond human imagination."
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.800]   They've never entered into the heart of man.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.100]   He tells us that our resurrection bodies
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.640]   will be spiritual bodies.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   Well, who can say all that is involved in a spiritual body?
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:52.080]   John speaks in Revelation 21, 23
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   of a world in which there will be no need of sun or moon,
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.220]   because the glory of God gives it light
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.920]   and its lamp is the lamb.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.700]   Well, who can imagine a world
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.080]   with no sources of created light,
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.620]   but only God's light?
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.700]   And in Revelation 21, 18, John says,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.520]   "The city," New Jerusalem,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   "the city was pure gold, like clear glass."
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.140]   What's that?
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.680]   Gold that is clear as glass.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   Jonathan Edwards wrote an entire sermon on that text,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.100]   Revelation 21, 18, and here's the title.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   Nothing on earth can represent the glories of heaven,
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.420]   because there is no such thing on earth
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.660]   as gold that is clear as glass,
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.500]   and that's the way it's gonna be like.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   So yes, I think we will work in the final age to come,
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.080]   whether we will do what we were gifted for here,
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.300]   or whether we will have holy new giftings
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.180]   a thousand times greater,
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.060]   or what kind of work John Piper will be doing.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.620]   I leave in the hands of God,
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.780]   who planned the universe for the happiness
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.840]   of his people in himself.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.140]   We will not be disappointed.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.540]   Yeah, amen, we know that for sure.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.360]   There's no disappointments in store in the new creation.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.900]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.740]   and thank you for joining us today,
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.800]   and happy Labor Day for those of you for whom this applies.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.100]   and we will see you back here on Thursday,
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.100]   talking about Calvinism.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.100]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:53.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
