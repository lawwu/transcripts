[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and I just wanted to check in because it's
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.600]   been a while.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.660]   In this episode I want to talk about why I'm so positive that anybody can achieve anything
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.800]   they want due to all the strange, head-scratching things that are happening in this world.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000]   Here are three recent examples.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.120]   1.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.000]   Felicity Huffman, the actress, gets 14 days in jail for paying someone $15,000 to boost
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.320]   her daughter's SAT score.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.440]   Although as a parent I empathize with why Felicity did what she did, it just makes me
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.080]   believe that many more parents are now going to try and game the system to give their already
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.680]   privileged children a leg up.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480]   14 days really is only 7 days because each day you serve, you get one day off for good
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   behavior.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.680]   Think about it, wouldn't you be willing to take a week's vacation in jail if you could
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.720]   set your kid up for life?
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.360]   I'm sure with the hyper-competitiveness today, some parents would probably be willing to
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.160]   spend a year in jail to help their kids.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.640]   And speaking of parents, I met a whole bunch of parents this past weekend because it was
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.680]   our first parent-teacher-kids little playground get-together shindig.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.520]   Raised a little bit of money and I got to see how other parents interact with their
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.480]   kids and how other kids interact in an open setting.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.480]   And it was great.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480]   It was great to meet people, a lot of international parents.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.500]   I would say at least 50% of the parents spoke another language so that really motivated
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.640]   me to speak more Mandarin at home.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.880]   And the jury is still out on preschool.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880]   It's only been a couple of weeks, folks.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.800]   But the initial reaction was preschool is where creativity goes to die.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.500]   It's kind of a sad outlook where conformity begins and this is the start of how kids go
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.520]   through the system to enter these schools and these are the parents who are the ones
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.960]   who bribe their kids into these schools.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.760]   But that's a pretty pessimistic way of looking at things.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.920]   I'm still going to reserve judgment for preschool until I would say one or two more
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.000]   months and it's okay.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.760]   It's a good place to learn.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.800]   It's a good place to learn how to socialize and listen to instructions and so forth.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.560]   But I'm not sure whether it's worth it or not.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.680]   Okay, two.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.920]   The second example, a recent example of why I believe anybody can achieve anything.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.120]   Have you heard of this guy named Shane Gills?
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.200]   Well, he was recently hired along with a couple other cast members to join Saturday Night
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.640]   Live despite repeated racial slurs against Asians.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.880]   He even called presidential candidate Andrew Yang a "Jew chink" on a podcast earlier
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.400]   in 2019.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.840]   So this is not something that he was saying 5, 10, 20 years ago.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.640]   It was just recent this year.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.360]   So yet despite all this, he got one of the highest profile jobs on TV and will likely
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.000]   keep his job after his non-apology.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.800]   He did write a note and posted on Twitter and said, "If I offended any of you guys,
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.560]   I'm trying to push the boundaries, yada, yada, yada."
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.920]   So as someone who was called chink quite frequently while growing up in Virginia for high school
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.200]   and college, I've become desensitized to racial insults.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.400]   When I hear this type of stuff, it just goes in one ear and out the other because that's
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.280]   just the way it is for minorities in America.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.680]   And it's kind of sad.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.520]   It is kind of sad, but the reality is I don't think anything is really going to change.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.840]   I've been listening to this stuff for the past 20 something years.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.640]   I came to the States when I was, what, 14 years old and I'm 42 years old now.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.920]   I mean, that's a long time, folks.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.160]   So if you are a target of racism or bullying, online bullying and so forth, you've got to
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.360]   find a way somehow to pay them no attention and keep on going no matter what.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.800]   For me, I use racism as motivation, motivation to achieve financial independence.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.040]   And I do believe one of the best solutions to racism is achieving financial independence
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.200]   because you are then beholden to nobody.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.640]   If someone wants to come at you and tell you to do this, this and that and then say something
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.840]   bad about your ethnicity, well, if you're financially independent, you can just tell
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.560]   them to screw off.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.880]   And then online, if someone's coming at you racially, I don't know, it just doesn't make
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.160]   any sense, especially if they still need a job and money to provide for their own lives.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.760]   Because if you're financially independent, you can go to war quite easily and win if
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.320]   you choose.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.440]   So folks, it's a rough world out there.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.480]   Try to pay no attention or use racism and bullying to give yourself motivation to work
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.920]   a little bit harder and achieve financial independence because it is one of the best
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.680]   ways to live your life free and live the life the way you want.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.260]   Okay, finally, number three, Andy Rubin, quote, the father of Android at Google.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.520]   He got a 90 million severance package despite having some rather questionable relationships
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.960]   with multiple women at work, including a subordinate.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.000]   He said he did nothing wrong, it was all consensual, while all the other women said he did do something
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   wrong.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.780]   So who knows the real truth other than he was asked to go and there's probably something
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.800]   going on there.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.040]   And the point is, I still get people all the time saying that negotiating a severance is
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.220]   too good to be true.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.700]   Despite very sketchy people who probably did something to violate company guidelines getting
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.920]   massive, massive severance packages all the darn time.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.560]   90 million dollars, folks.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.160]   So please, you're fooling yourself if you feel like you don't deserve something you've
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.080]   worked hard for.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.140]   People less worthy than you are getting everything every single day.
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.840]   It really is a mindset, folks.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.180]   You need to believe you deserve to be rich.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.680]   You need to believe that you deserve to get that promotion or that raise.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   You need to believe that you belong.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.240]   And once you have that positive mindset, that strong money mindset, things are going to
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.400]   get much, much better for you.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.640]   So what else is going on?
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:16.480]   Well, in the market, the S&P 500 yield was at one point higher than the 10-year bond
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   yield.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.360]   And that's really unique because the S&P 500 has historically shown a positive return of
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.440]   anywhere from 5.5% to 10% a year.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.920]   And so if you've got that yield on top of that principal return, that is a really attractive
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   proposition.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.560]   And we've done a little study that shows that whenever you buy the S&P 500 when its
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.000]   yield is higher than the 10-year bond yield, you tend to do well.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.080]   Moving on to real estate, my favorite asset class over the long term, things are a little
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   bit of a conundrum right now because the 10-year bond yield has actually moved up over the
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.440]   past couple of weeks.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.680]   It bottomed out at around 1.55%, and now it's back up to 1.9%.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.480]   So that arbitrage of going long online savings account for 2.2% or 2.3% and then shorting
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:15.320]   the bond, Treasury bond fund, for example, IEF, has closed quite significantly.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.560]   But don't worry, there are other arbitrage opportunities every single day, so you just
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.280]   got to go look.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.940]   For real estate, I am seriously, seriously thinking about pulling the trigger and buying
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.840]   a nicer home or bigger home with panoramic ocean views because there are more opportunities
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.280]   right now.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.120]   Rates are still low, inventory is high, and people are nervous.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:46.000]   Now the question is whether we're going to roll over 10%, 15%, 20%, maybe more like in
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.480]   the past financial crisis.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.600]   And I honestly think the answer is no.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.880]   I really believe that real estate, again, real estate is local too, so you just can't
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.360]   take my word and apply it to every single market because we all live in different places.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.840]   But at least here for San Francisco, I see at most a 10% drop and then it's kind of steady,
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.560]   stabilized and then off to the races again.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   That's just our market.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.860]   You've got to look at your market and check out the inventory numbers because the inventory
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.760]   numbers definitely look like they're piling up in places like New York, Seattle, Portland,
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.080]   San Francisco, and Texas.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.440]   So just be careful, but if you're looking to buy a property, you need to buy a property
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.440]   because your family is expanding or you just are too cramped in your place or you just
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.540]   want to acquire a street or whatever, it's worth looking aggressively right now from
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:43.840]   now through the end of the year because this is probably one of the weakest periods of
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.680]   real estate I've seen in a while other than the second half of 2018.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.480]   All right folks, I hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.960]   I think I'm going to do more of these check-in type quick episodes with more real-time thoughts
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.120]   and things.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.320]   So let me know if you like it, if you don't like it.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.360]   Please leave a comment or a positive rating if you enjoyed this episode and I'll talk
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   to you guys later.
