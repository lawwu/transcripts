[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Another thing that's important is to be able to search multiple airports at once.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.280]   You can often find better deals by flying to different airports and you might have to then
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.320]   book another short distance flight, let's say, to get to where you really want to end up ultimately.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.880]   The more you do searches, the more you're going to want that capability to put in multiple airports.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.880]   My wife and I were going to Japan. We really wanted to do it in business. From Portland,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.840]   the flights were in business were like one quarter of the cost on the kind of range of dates we
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.280]   wanted as they were from San Francisco. It was like 100,000 something round trip from Portland
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.520]   and like 400,000 round trip in San Francisco. And the flight to Portland was like $100 each way.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.200]   $200 plus, you know, 100,000 points is infinitely better than spending 100,000 points.
