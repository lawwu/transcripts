[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Current population of Earth is 7.8 billion people.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.100]   Since about 50,000 years ago,
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.280]   when modern Homo sapiens first appeared,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.280]   the number of people who have lived is 109 billion,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.920]   which naturally leads to the other number
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.280]   that gives me pause.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.480]   Since the origin of modern humans,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.600]   101 billion people have died.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.240]   101 billion stories of suffering, of triumph,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   of death in infancy, of living beyond 100 years old,
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.080]   of wars, of hatred, of love, and beauty.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.320]   The data sources, estimates, and projections for this video
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.720]   are from the United Nations
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.800]   and the Population Reference Bureau.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.040]   So the natural question I had when looking at these numbers
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.160]   is what are the next milestones?
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.320]   When will the 110th, the 150th,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.700]   the 200 billionth person be born?
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.000]   And of course, let me say that predicting the future
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.900]   of anything beyond 10 to 20 years is very difficult.
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.060]   So this is more of an exercise of building intuition
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.700]   about the prospects of human civilization.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240]   This is the plot of the world population
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.880]   on the Y-axis in billions from zero to 12,
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.680]   on the X-axis from the 1500s to 2100.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.480]   We'll reach eight billion people in 2022
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.640]   and 10 billion people in 2056.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.000]   Based on your own projections,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.160]   the population of Earth should level out by 2100
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.600]   at about 11 billion people.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.080]   By the way, there are a lot of estimates
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.860]   of Earth's carrying capacity,
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.280]   the median of those estimates
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.280]   being around 10 billion people.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.720]   So there's a lot of debates
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.240]   on whether we'll eventually exceed
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.800]   the human carrying capacity of Earth.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.680]   It should also be noted that since we're living
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.400]   in the times of COVID,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.560]   the estimates for excess deaths in 2020
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.120]   should be anywhere from zero to 20%.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.060]   In several studies of the topic,
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.040]   the estimate rests at about 20% excess deaths.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.660]   So 20% more deaths than otherwise would be expected
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.160]   for a non-pandemic year.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.240]   But when we look at 2020 as a whole,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.600]   it's very possible it levels out
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.800]   to much closer to 0% excess deaths,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.280]   given the effects of lockdown
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.560]   on the patterns of human behavior.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.760]   Now, we can take these projections of the world population
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.080]   and the birth rates estimated by the United Nations
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.800]   and talk about the number of people
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.480]   who have ever lived projected out into the future.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.300]   Now, we hit the 50 billion person born mark
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.440]   just about a century and a half
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.720]   after the common era began.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.160]   And we hit the 100 billionth mark just before 1950.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.840]   The 110th billion person will be born in 2028.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.400]   The 120th billion in 2102.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   The 150th billion about three centuries from now in 2340.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.600]   And the 200 billionth person will be born in 2736,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.800]   which is about seven centuries from now.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.720]   Unless, as described in the Global Catastrophic Risk Survey
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   about existential risk,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.500]   that estimates the probability
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.640]   of the destruction of human civilization in a century
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.960]   at a terrifying 19%.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   And if we take that out to 2736,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.760]   the probability that the 200 billionth person
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.360]   will never be born, at least on Earth,
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.240]   at a terrifying 77%.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.640]   Of course, it's possible that the 200 billionth person
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.680]   will be born on Mars, or maybe even Proxima B,
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.860]   the closest Earth-like planet outside of our solar system
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.320]   that we currently know.
