[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.220]   Expert panel members come on their own dime, they don't get comped,
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.100]   they pay just like the zinc as you do.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.300]   And one little perk that I normally allow them is to tell us what's exciting,
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.420]   what's going on in their neck of the woods or in what they're doing.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.380]   So we're going to go down to the table and Christine,
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.060]   anything exciting going on in Morningstar that you'd like to tell the crowd about?
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.500]   Or do you have any books in the works?
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260]   >> No books for me.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.540]   I would say one concept that I've been excited about,
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.380]   the more I've talked to Morningstar.com users about it,
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380]   is this idea of bucketed portfolios in retirement.
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.860]   I've done a couple model portfolios recently.
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.780]   And the concept is that you set aside liquid assets to fund near term cash needs,
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.180]   intermediate term assets to fund intermediate term needs.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.620]   And then we have the rest of the portfolio stocks.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.060]   And for a lot of people, the end portfolio ends up looking a lot like what
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.140]   they would have had in the first place if they were just using a balanced approach.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.980]   But the bucketing concept, I think,
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.300]   helps people visualize what an end retirement portfolio should look like.
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.860]   So I think it's helpful from that standpoint.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.180]   So I've been working on that, interviewing a lot of great people at Vanguard yesterday,
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.060]   and a lot of great people from this conference yesterday morning.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.860]   So those videos will roll out on our website over the next month or so.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.220]   You should keep your eyes peeled for that.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.460]   And then personally, I'm going on a six week sabbatical starting next week.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.420]   And so I'm excited about that, going to spend some time in Argentina and
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.140]   spend some time with family and projects and so forth.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.300]   So it's a nice perk that we have at Morningstar, and
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.340]   I'll be taking advantage of it soon.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.460]   >> And Bill, I know you ventured into a new field, electronic publishing.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.660]   >> Yeah, with some help from Mike.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.380]   But what I'm really doing is traveling to Burma this winter and
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.020]   expecting my first grandchild.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.260]   And sure, I'm doing some writing, I'm always doing some writing.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.300]   But I've got a new book that's coming out, I'm on alternatives.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.300]   But if you listen carefully, especially if you listen to the interview,
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.380]   you're coming out of the Morningstar site, you don't need to buy it.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.380]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.900]   >> All right, I got Bill Bernstein, B, and one thing, I already have a grandson.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.060]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.020]   >> Nine years ago,
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.380]   never in my life have I been able to say that.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.280]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.780]   >> But that's been great, yeah,
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.780]   first grandchild.
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.580]   But yeah, I'm starting a new book.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.740]   And it's something I wrote about on the forum that I thought needs to be
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.380]   expanded on, and other than that, I'm just working on my blog.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.140]   And things are good.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.060]   >> No new projects in the work for me, I just wrapped one up.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.700]   It's a book on social security planning.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.420]   Heard from a lot of you about that.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.540]   We already downloaded it, some of you have read it already.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.980]   That's about it, really, just working on the blog.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.100]   >> But I will have to say that I downloaded Mike's.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.780]   Mike does a whole series of books in 100 pages or less.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.300]   And his latest one was the Social Security in 100 pages or less.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.220]   I downloaded it and read it, and let me tell you,
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.780]   Mike took a very complicated subject and made it very simple.
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.940]   And as an author, I can tell you that it's very difficult to do, and great job.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.180]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.060]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.180]   >> I don't have a whole lot more bandwidth.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.420]   I've started writing for AARP Magazine, and I think that is incredibly important,
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.100]   because no one gets abused more than seniors.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.780]   I think if I had a pipe dream, and it's probably just a pipe dream,
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.340]   is to harness Bill and work on a social media game that would actually
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.260]   teach the right thing about being a competitor to the stock market game,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.380]   which teaches gambling and speculation.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.940]   And of course, it's sponsored by, guess who, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Smith.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.860]   Barney, that is something that I would love to do.
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.540]   >> What he really does for a living is to do his best to piss off
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.380]   the financial services industry.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.660]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.900]   >> And I'm good at what I do.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.780]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:50.380]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.100]   >> Well, what am I doing?
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.260]   >> How's your golf game?
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.420]   >> Gosh, I'm embarrassed to say that my handicap has gone up about two or
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.940]   three strokes over the last year, but there's a good reason for that,
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.180]   which I won't get into.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.140]   >> Four foot putts.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.500]   >> Yeah, four foot putts.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.660]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.620]   >> I'm kinda doing more of the same.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.540]   I do have the second copy house book in the works.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.700]   I've been saying that for the last two or three years.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.980]   Where's Bill Faloon?
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.660]   Bill Faloon, would you stand up please?
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.220]   I guess he's not here, but he's been a big advocate of the Global Heads to John Wiley.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.100]   But basically what I'm doing is continuing to spend a lot of time at
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.900]   SoundMark putting in systems and structures to continue to
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.540]   accentuate the Global Head philosophy with the folks we connect with.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.140]   I really, Alan, I respect you're getting under the skin of the financial industry
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.980]   because they need to have someone kind of prodding them.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.980]   And again, the need is just phenomenal.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.140]   And as I said before, I would encourage all of you to continue to
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.140]   share the philosophy with others.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.940]   A lot of people ask, well gosh, how do I best articulate or share it?
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.660]   Why doesn't a person embrace it like I do?
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.740]   And what I have found is that people need to hear the philosophy
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.540]   about 20 or 30 times before they get it.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.900]   That's been my experience.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.460]   >> Did anybody read the Global Head site about what happened on Jeopardy a couple
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.180]   weeks ago?
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.540]   What happened?
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.740]   Stand up and tell us what happened.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.480]   >> Well, they couldn't, they gave them the answer and then-
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.140]   >> Who gave them the answer?
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.180]   >> Warren.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.140]   >> Warren Buffett.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.260]   >> Yeah, Warren Buffett gave the answer and
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.860]   they couldn't come up with the index funds to get a proper response.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.220]   I have no idea what the answer was, so you've got a few questions.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.420]   >> The question is, when does the index start?
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.380]   >> Okay. >> Yeah, the answer is,
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.500]   what is a low-cost investment that mimics an S&P 500, blah, blah, blah, or
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.100]   something, isn't that what the answer was?
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.340]   >> Yeah, and they spelled it out pretty clearly.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.580]   >> They spelled it out clearly, and not one person could answer index funds.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.340]   And just index funds is just like second nature, but
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.180]   to the average intelligent investor, it's like, they don't know what an index fund
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.700]   is, so you have to continue to articulate it time and time again, keep it simple.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.460]   Again, Lock the Yank Network, profoundly positive impact on people's lives.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.860]   So Mel said that because you wound up this part with me,
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.780]   I get to ask a question.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.580]   So the question for the panelists is, when you're working with folks,
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.980]   how do you define risk?
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:41.940]   When you're working with clients, this whole thing of risk and
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:48.460]   standard deviation, and blah, blah, blah, how do you articulate risk to a human being?
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.860]   Am I reaching your financial goals?
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.860]   >> [INAUDIBLE] >> Bill, Mike, Christine?
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.100]   >> I tend to talk about it differently whether I'm talking with somebody who's
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.260]   in the accumulation stage or the distribution stage.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.940]   In the accumulation stage, I'm mostly talking about just uncertainty of returns,
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.100]   volatility, probability of the portfolio is going to go down by x amount,
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.340]   things of that nature.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.380]   In the distribution stage, we're talking about percentage of spending goals that go
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.740]   unmet, for instance.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.860]   Sometimes that's expressed as probability of running out of money.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.300]   Sometimes it's, probability of running out of money doesn't cover it,
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.820]   because sometimes it's different if you run out of money in the fifth year
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.420]   of retirement, as opposed to the 25th year of retirement.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.660]   So there are other metrics, but it depends who I'm talking to, I think.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.700]   >> Yeah, we deal with that problem by not accepting clients who don't understand
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.100]   what a standard deviation is.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.540]   >> [LAUGH] >> That's why he has three clients and
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.140]   they all have $75,000.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.580]   >> [LAUGH] >> I like Rick and
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.780]   Mike's definition, and I do think that risk tolerance has been given way too
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.740]   much play in terms of investors' financial decision making.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.460]   In a lot of ways, I feel like it's saying, okay, you're going to give your emotions
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.660]   free reign to help determine this financial plan.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.300]   And I think that's a terrible idea.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.620]   So I like risk framed in the realm of risk capacity.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.340]   How much risk can you actually withstand without altering
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.220]   the goals that you had set out for yourself?
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.220]   >> Instead of working in percentages, I try to work in dollars.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.900]   Because I think people understand dollars a lot more than percentages.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.860]   So if someone has a half a million dollar portfolio and
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.420]   they're gonna go 50/50, they got 250 in equities.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:46.340]   And I ask if they can stand to lose 125,000, not can you afford to lose 50%.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.780]   And when you put it in dollars, people go, my god, no.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.100]   >> [LAUGH] >> That's what they really need to do to
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.900]   get to their own comfort level, which is when they get to that sleep night, and
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.940]   that's the proper asset allocation for them.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.300]   >> Well, what is your answer?
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.420]   >> Well, my answer is a compilation of everyone.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.620]   I really like what Mel said.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.100]   So if somebody's got a million dollar portfolio, they've got 50% in bonds and
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.180]   50% in stocks, we look them in the eye and say, hey, you're 50%,
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.260]   your half a million dollar portfolio is gonna drop 25 to 40%.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.660]   And that is what, how much?
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.140]   I can't do the math, but I feel it's gonna, quarter of a million dollars, maybe?
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.780]   So we say your portfolio will drop $200,000 in the next four years.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.540]   How you feel about that?
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.460]   And it puts it in terms that they can understand.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:40.540]   And but what's more important, I love Charles Ellis' description of risk.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.780]   In his book, what's his book, Winning the Loser's Game, or something like that?
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.900]   He says, risk is the chance that you will not have the money
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.740]   to pay a bill when it comes due, and I just love that.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.380]   You can talk about risk and standard deviation, but
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.460]   I love Charles Ellis' definition of risk.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.220]   And if you can show people that, yeah, interest rates are at 1%,
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.140]   you're not getting anything on your fixed income investments.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.460]   But if you can show them that even in a decline of 20 to 40%,
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.580]   they're still gonna be able to pay their bills for the next ten years.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.780]   They think, you know what,
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.340]   it doesn't matter what the stock market does over the next two years.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.580]   >> Yeah, I mean, that's the concept that I try to continually get across when I
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:31.740]   talk to any kind of audience, from retail investors all the way up to people
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.900]   at the university level, is to tell them that the real definition of risk is not
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:42.180]   standard deviation or volatility, and I make a point by showing two slides.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.340]   One is the typical sort of thing you pick off the Internet from crybaby traders.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.020]   >> [LAUGH] >> You've all seen the pictures and
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.500]   the thots in suits standing next to monitors looking like they've just had
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.820]   their donut squeezed. >> [LAUGH]
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.420]   >> And then that's not risk, all right?
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.460]   Cuz those guys will still be wearing $2,000 suits the next day,
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.900]   they will still be dining at the Russian tea house the next day.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.140]   The real, then the next slide that I show is a picture of a guy pushing
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.940]   a shopping cart under an underpass in the rain, I say that's risk.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:18.180]   >> I tend to think about it in standard deviation probabilities, but
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.740]   I explain it to my clients in the likelihood that they'll live under a bridge.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.300]   I try to make it as emotional as possible.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.180]   I tell them, I can ask them the question how they would feel if their portfolio
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.500]   lost 30%, but I explain that I can't really simulate the pain they'd be feeling
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.100]   without coming across the table and kicking them in the gut a few times.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.220]   Even though it happened not too long ago, our memories are very short.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.260]   >> Can I just add one more thing to this element of risk?
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.860]   So from my perspective as a portfolio manager,
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:13:01.340]   the risk to a client is not maintaining their investment plan.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.780]   That's the risk.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.220]   Because if they can stick with the investment plan,
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.940]   the probability that they're gonna reach their financial goals is quite high.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.940]   So the real risk is not having a plan, and
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.980]   then if they do have a plan, not maintaining the plan.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.660]   And then a lot of people with standard deviation,
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.220]   the amount of money that you might have lost in your portfolio all boils into
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.340]   this idea that you're gonna do the wrong thing at the wrong time.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:34.260]   And that's the risk that we face as advisors to individuals.
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.300]   >> Hey, Robert from Long Beach, stand up and
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.260]   tell us what the leading edge analysis of risk is.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.140]   >> [LAUGH] >> This is untested theory.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.060]   >> Stand up.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:55.060]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:18.500]   >> That's interesting.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.580]   >> We're all very brave in a bull market.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.220]   >> [LAUGH] >> But your real risk tolerance,
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.940]   you find it in a bear market.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.340]   And so it's what you're talking about is methodologies to realize exactly what
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.380]   your risk tolerance really is, not what you say it is.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.380]   Because usually there are two different things.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.900]   >> Did you get your question answered?
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.780]   Okay, I found out that I had mentioned something, and
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.420]   people asked me to explain it.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.180]   I thought that most people knew about it, but apparently not.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.480]   When I mentioned I-bonds and the ability to get 10,000 per person.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.580]   But then I mentioned that there was a back door to get paper I-bonds of $5,000
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.820]   if you overpay your tax return as part of your tax or all of your tax refund.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:17.460]   And the way it works is you have to intentionally overpay your taxes by $5,000.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:24.420]   When you file your tax return, you can elect to have your entire return or
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.460]   part of your return in I-bonds, issued in I-bonds.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:34.060]   And any surplus would go in your bank.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.100]   You can split it any way you want.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.740]   But to get the $5,000 in I-bonds, you have to overpay your taxes.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.780]   And some people do it by additional withdrawing,
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.660]   some people do it by estimated tax.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:53.980]   But the bottom line is you overpay your tax, and you can get your $5,000,
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:59.460]   up to $5,000, as opposed to the individual I-bonds where it's 5,000 or
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.020]   10,000 per Social Security number.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.860]   With couples, you still can only get $5,000.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:11.340]   I wouldn't guarantee that this is gonna go on, it's been in place.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:17.420]   They honored it last year, and there's nothing out that they killed it for
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:23.620]   this year, but eventually, their objective obviously is to get rid of paper I-bonds.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:29.060]   So I would expect at some point in the future that that's not gonna be an option.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.500]   But at least that's the way it works, overpay your taxes, and
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.820]   fill out the paperwork to get part of your refund, part or
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.780]   all of your refund, paper I-bonds, up to $5,000.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:48.100]   So let's get on to another question, here's a question for Rick Perry.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.300]   Rick, you wrote a blog on the three P's to investment success,
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.300]   philosophy, strategy, and discipline.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.140]   Can you expand on these ideas?
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:07.220]   >> Three P's to investment success, sounds like a book, which it will be.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.980]   But anyway, okay, here's, I'm thinking a lot about the philosophy
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:18.300]   of what we do as a group, and then what we do on the board.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.380]   And that's where all this came from.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:26.900]   Cuz we have had some severe discussions about things that don't matter much.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.060]   >> [LAUGH] >> We really can get into the minutiae.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.700]   And so, in stepping back from it all, I'm saying, hey, wait a minute,
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.140]   we're all mogul heads.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.940]   We're all sitting in this room.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:41.620]   So at the very first level, I started thinking, we all in this room and
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.440]   everyone who is a member of the board, for the most part, and
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.420]   a lot of other people who are not, have the same philosophy, do we not?
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.740]   And we have a list of the ten beliefs, and I didn't even know that list existed.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.820]   But we all have the same philosophy.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.660]   But there are perhaps 200 people in this room, and I would say that there are
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:05.860]   probably 200 different strategies for implementing that philosophy.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.580]   High bonds, municipal bonds, lateral CDs.
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.180]   So at the strategy level,
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.620]   we all have different ideas of how we want to implement the philosophy.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.420]   And you know what?
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:22.620]   I can't say that my idea is any better than his idea, his idea.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.980]   Anybody's idea out there?
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.620]   Because we won't know that until 20 years down the road.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.140]   We have the best strategy.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.860]   So strategy can differ on the board.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.620]   And most of the arguments that we have on the board are not about philosophy at all.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.700]   They're about strategy, and sometimes very minutiae strategy,
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.100]   whether we should have gold, or whether we should have commodities, or
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.420]   whether we should have high-level bonds, or whether we should do the Modi model.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.180]   Whatever.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.860]   So the second level of this is strategy, and we'll argue about that all day long.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.620]   The point that I try to bring up on the board once in a while is in order not to
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.820]   confuse new people who are coming onto the board, or
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:05.460]   people who are just getting started, is don't confuse strategy with philosophy.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.020]   Don't confuse strategy.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:13.260]   This is a discussion about this, we all agree on that.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.540]   Now the last part of the three keys to investment success is once you have
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.100]   the philosophy, once you have your strategy, whatever it is you think you need,
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.660]   the last part is discipline.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.860]   And we do talk a lot about discipline.
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.020]   We were talking earlier about, and I said,
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.580]   the risk is not meeting your financial objectives, it's a discipline.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.060]   So now we have discussions about how to maintain discipline.
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.580]   You can use some sort of a rebalancing methodology on your birthday.
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:44.620]   You can hire an advisor, you can use a life strategy fund of some sort.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:50.300]   I mean, that maintains the discipline of the strategy, which fits the philosophy.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.260]   If you don't have the discipline, if the discipline starts to break down,
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.140]   the strategy breaks down.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.980]   And if the strategy starts breaking down, now you're susceptible to the next
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.040]   Merrill Lynch guy that calls you on the phone,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.220]   which means the philosophy can also start to break down.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.460]   So it goes down this way, and then you have to maintain the discipline or
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.340]   it starts corroding back up the other way.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.900]   And that's what my whole idea is about what we do.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.640]   >> Was that insightful?
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:32.060]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.220]   >> Okay, we have a question for Bill Schultes from Sonny.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.980]   He says, the coffeehouse portfolio received a lot of attention and
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.940]   popularity during the last decade.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.700]   Part of which is at least due to the outperformance of small value and
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.740]   other tilts over the market, or S&P 500.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:57.380]   If reversion to the mean happens, can the coffeehouse portfolio and
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:03.500]   the coffeehouse underperform, how can we keep the coffeehouse message popular?
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.500]   >> Wow, that's a great question, Sonny.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.960]   And I think I would have liked to say that I planted that question,
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.420]   because it encompasses a lot of what is discussed on the board.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:22.980]   First, I think it's important for me to share with anyone who wants to listen.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:28.220]   That in the book, I said that the simplest, best approach is like
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.660]   a three-fund portfolio, total domestic, total international, total bond.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.220]   I said, if you want to fine tune an already good thing, here's a way to do it.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.780]   And that was kind of how I started articulating that coffeehouse philosophy
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:47.100]   in my weekly column in 2000, and it just kind of took on a life of its own.
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.940]   Paul Farrell hooked it up on the Lazy Portfolios, and I have consistently said
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:56.420]   that there are, as Rick was saying, there's countless different ways to build
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:01.020]   a passive portfolio, you can do it with actively managed funds.
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:07.340]   But it was a stroke of luck that from 2000 to 2010, value in small and
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.900]   international outperformed large cap stocks.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.580]   So the question is, what is the purpose of diversification in these different
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.700]   components of the market?
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:21.820]   Well, I loved what Joel Dixon said last night about that whole issue.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:27.340]   What he said is that basically, he does not want to have,
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.460]   I mean, clearly over a ten year period, these different components of the market
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:37.540]   can perform dissimilar to each other, and case in point, 2000 to 2010.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:42.820]   Last night, Joel Dixon said, he doesn't want to be in that underperforming sector
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.220]   over the next ten years, and that's kind of the way that I look at it myself.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.540]   If I'm gonna buy a total stock market index fund,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.020]   what's important is that I stay the course.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:59.260]   And I accept the fact that from 2000 to 2010, it's gonna underperform.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.460]   If I have a more diversified portfolio that's tilted away from a total stock
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.460]   market fund, and small, and value, and international outperform the S&P 500,
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.460]   which it very well may do, I think it has over the last three or four years.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.580]   The important thing is to stay the course and not to chase performance
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.180]   when these different components of the market underperform each other.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.700]   Because as Rick was saying, it's the philosophy that counts.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.540]   And if you can't adhere to the philosophy, everything else breaks down.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:34.180]   And so the philosophy, in my opinion, is to embrace a low-cost portfolio
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.780]   that broadly represents where you're at in your life.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.500]   And then what it does is it allows you to focus on your financial planning issues,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.620]   which for 99% of the people, including me, is I need to save more than I spend.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.940]   Does that answer your question, Sonny?
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.220]   >> Can you tell us the subtitle to your book?
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:58.020]   >> [LAUGH] How to Build Wealth, Ignore Wall Street, and Get On With Your Life.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.140]   >> I think that's more important than the portfolio.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.780]   >> Yeah, and you know, I have to say that in connecting with everyone here,
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.100]   where's Molly?
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.020]   Molly, are you here?
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.780]   You know, here's a woman that ran her, what, her first marathon when,
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.380]   how old were you?
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.140]   >> 65.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.380]   >> 65 years old.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:21.140]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   >> She's involved with an entity and
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.900]   a program that I have been involved with.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.420]   And who, where's Bill Davidson?
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.020]   Stand up, Bill.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.860]   Is he here?
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.780]   He's not here.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:33.820]   He's involved also.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.300]   She's involved with hospice.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.260]   To me, the biggest, well, I don't wanna get into that.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:42.540]   But, you know, she's, it gives her the authority to know that she's doing
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.180]   the right thing with her portfolio so she can pursue other things in her life.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:50.980]   And, you know, I travel all across the nation not to talk about strategy but
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.420]   to connect with people who are really getting on with their lives.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.580]   It's so inspirational.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.420]   Just, you know, my hat is off to all of you for coming here.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.020]   Where's Calvin?
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.100]   All the way from Taiwan.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.180]   He left.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.060]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.460]   >> What's that?
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.260]   >> Not on the plate.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.460]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.260]   >> So thanks, Mike, for bringing that up.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.140]   >> Yeah, I mean, you know, just to, you know, add a tag to all of that.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.740]   You know, if you've invested with any of the kinds of portfolios that we
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.780]   recommend, the coffee house portfolio, the material portfolios that Rick and
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.220]   I recommend, you've been through hell and back the past several years.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.580]   And you know, you know, it's hard, you know, I suppose we couldn't see times that
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.140]   are even worse than that, but you probably haven't missed a turn to stick with it.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.100]   We could probably fill ten rooms like this with enthusiasts of
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:45.740]   the Harry Brown portfolio, which is one quarter gold, long bonds, stocks, and bills.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.660]   And, and these are people who've had nothing but pizza and
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.940]   beer for the past 15 years.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:58.100]   And there are a lot of enthusiasts, Harry Brown enthusiasts out there, and
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:04.260]   they're going to get, you know, get their trial by fire in the next five or
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.460]   ten years, I'm pretty sure.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.940]   It'll be very interesting to see what happens to that group.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.620]   By the way, I like the Harry Brown portfolio.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.860]   I think it's a valid way to manage assets in the long term.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:18.740]   It's not for me and probably not for any of the people in this room.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.700]   But, but, but, you know, those are the people I'd really worry about.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.180]   >> I'm not a fan either of the Harry Brown, but again,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.860]   it falls under the vocal head philosophy because there's a passive strategy.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.180]   And they are using low cost index funds.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:38.460]   I'm not a fan of it either, but again, it gets down to our individual preference.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:44.540]   >> Okay, we have a, we had a question on, somebody asked me to elaborate on this.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:50.700]   Taylor's three fund portfolio, which I think was mentioned by several people.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.660]   Total stock, total bond, and total international.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:59.500]   Taylor later revised it when TIPS came out to add TIPS.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:06.460]   The question was, first of all, can you explain to a layperson what TIPS are?
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.420]   And would you add that to the total bond,
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:16.820]   the portfolio with total bond to be part of your bond allocation?
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.220]   >> Well, TIPS are just inflation adjusted bonds.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:26.260]   They promise an after inflation return rather than a nominal or before inflation return.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.420]   And as far as whether I would add them to a portfolio,
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:35.500]   I think it depends on personal circumstances, specifically how exposed are you to inflation.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.660]   Retirees tend to have more inflation risk than somebody whose overall economic
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.680]   well-being is primarily dependent upon a job.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.220]   Young people who, most of their economic well-being is just their future earnings,
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.020]   which hopefully will keep up with inflation.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.460]   And that's different from if you have a financial portfolio and
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.060]   you really are facing inflation risk.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.260]   And I think then that's when TIPS become significantly more helpful.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.900]   >> I would, go ahead, please.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:07.780]   >> I'm just gonna clarify that TIPS are a hedge against unanticipated inflation.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.860]   Because the inflation rate is already embedded into all the asset classes,
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.780]   including treasury bonds, not bills, but right now.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.340]   I mean, the Fed is manipulating things a little bit in treasuries, but
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.360]   it's already embedded in stock prices, real estate, rents, all of this stuff.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:27.460]   So what they are are a hedge against an unanticipated jump in the inflation rate.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.860]   And it has to be a jump, because if inflation goes into deflation,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.460]   then you're actually gonna do worse with TIPS than you are with a nominal trade.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.220]   >> Just to pick up on Mike's comments.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.060]   I know sometimes people are looking for
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.260]   guidelines about how much to invest in TIPS.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.100]   And I completely agree that it's very individual specific.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.700]   I talked to John Amarix at Vanguard about this issue.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.820]   We were talking about their target date products specifically.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:55.940]   And those products do not include TIPS until one reaches roughly the age of 50.
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.620]   And that syncs up with the work that my colleagues at Ibbotson,
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.540]   which is under the Morningstar umbrella, do.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.380]   Where they really don't add TIPS to the portfolio for
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.140]   people who are very much in accumulation mode.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.140]   But do start to add them in for people approaching retirement.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.380]   Ibbotson's recommended allocations to TIPS as a percentage of the fixed income
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:21.060]   portfolio typically run in the neighborhood of 20 to 30% of the bond
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.420]   portfolio in TIPS.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.180]   And I think John Amarix told me yesterday that the target date funds
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.900]   include about 20% of their overall allocations in TIPS.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.580]   So those are just some guidelines.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.060]   I think most of us, I don't know,
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.460]   might agree that TIPS aren't particularly attractive at this juncture.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.700]   And so I would say if you're building a TIPS position,
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.100]   my best guidance would be to do so gradually over a period of years,
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.500]   rather than adding a lot right now.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.300]   >> I'm not wildly enthusiastic about TIPS in an accumulation phase portfolio.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.420]   But where I think they're the most useful is in immunizing your future real
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.140]   living expenses.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.820]   So a person, for example, who is 60 years old might purchase what I call
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:12.740]   a full body, it's like full bonty except that it's TIPS,
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.580]   instead of the absence of clothes.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.420]   >> [LAUGH] >> What a full body is,
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:24.700]   is a ladder of TIPS in each and every year that immunizes you out to about 100.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.060]   Obviously, we'll have to double up in the first ten years because there's no 40
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.900]   year TIPS, and then we'll let over in ten years and buy the 30 year TIPS.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:38.540]   And that absolutely immunizes all of your real living expenses if you save 40 times
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:43.820]   your living expenses, which I suspect more than a few people in this room have done.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.580]   They're not particularly attractive right now, but
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.260]   it's something to keep an eye out for.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:52.460]   And maybe you won't want to build the full body, but you can build part of it.
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.300]   And it's a very useful thing, it takes the place basically of an amniotic.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:03.420]   >> I like TIPS, I own TIPS, and Bill, be interested to see if you back me up on this.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:08.020]   I'll confess I'm a bit of an active investor when it comes to TIPS.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:14.820]   TIPS are the safest investment around, US Treasury backed, no inflation risk.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:20.500]   In 2008, when market stocks tanked, people shouldn't run to TIPS,
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.220]   but instead they were yielding well over 3.5%.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:30.060]   It was a very good investment that, it's much less good now,
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:36.380]   in my opinion, with CPIU minus, what, about 0.7, 0.8%?
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:41.860]   >> I was very attracted to TIPS when they topped out over 4% back in the early,
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.260]   late 1990s.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:48.860]   I'm not terribly enthusiastic about them right now either.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:53.100]   You've got a negative yield on the curve all the way out to about 20 years.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.780]   It's pretty ridiculous.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.500]   >> Yeah, but people need to understand that's a negative real yield.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.980]   >> Negative real yield, yeah.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.700]   >> As opposed to nominal yield that you get on the record.
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:06.180]   And people look at, don't understand that their CD,
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.540]   which is yielding 0.5, has a built-in negative
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:15.380]   real return of maybe 2% or something.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:20.980]   So they compare, and think the CD is better, when in fact,
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.560]   the real return on a negative item, or
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.980]   tip, is still better than the negative real return that they're gonna get on their CD.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.580]   >> What Alan is referring to is something that Larry Sweater has explicitly
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:39.040]   written about, which is buying low and selling high, we've all heard about that.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:44.140]   >> [LAUGH] >> And I will admit to falling off
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.660]   the boat with one wagon in that regard as well.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.620]   It's a fun game to play, but that game is long.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.980]   It's over, maybe it'll start again.
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.720]   >> May I ask a question on tips?
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.380]   >> Say again, please.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.620]   >> May I ask a question on tips?
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.140]   >> Go ahead.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.620]   >> Does Banff Yard have a, it was announced they had a short fund for tips now?
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.380]   >> Yeah, it now exists.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:06.700]   >> Could you address the advantages of short fund versus the long fund?
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.500]   >> Well, one thing, and I'd like to ask Bill this, or anybody on the panel or
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.100]   in the audience, is that the tips have,
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.700]   the longer tips have had significant price appreciation.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.580]   And so, my question is, if rates go up,
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:28.580]   are you gonna see some significant price decline?
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.660]   Now, I realize we still have the unexpected inflation built in.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:38.140]   But I think that we've still got the issue of, Rick, why don't you answer that?
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.940]   You've got some significant short term principal.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.340]   >> Yeah, it depends on why interest rates went up.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:51.960]   If interest rates went up, would real rates of return go up?
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:57.140]   Meaning that, okay, real rates of return.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.980]   Inflation expectations remain low when interest rates go up.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.020]   But inflation didn't go up, but interest rates went up.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.780]   That's a real rate of return.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.060]   That's a risk to tips.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.380]   In other words, if inflation goes up and
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.980]   interest rates go up, then that's not a risk to tips.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:19.820]   But there's another risk of tips, which I think you've overshadowed even that,
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.180]   which is it really didn't get revealed until the crisis,
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.180]   which is there's a third risk, which is liquidity risk.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:32.780]   From '07 to late '08, the long tips was, I think,
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:38.880]   the 30, 32 tips, which are 24-year maturity, and it declined by almost 25%.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:46.520]   So that means 30-year tips, a similar event would decline by about 30% in principal value.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.960]   So it's a peculiar asset class.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.720]   It is absolutely riskless in a real sense, in real terms,
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.200]   when held to maturity, which is how you really wanna be using them, right?
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.440]   But if you depend on them for short-term liquidity, then good luck with that.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.280]   >> That's where the short-term tips comes in to answer your question, okay?
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.120]   Short-term tips have far less of this price volatility.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:14.800]   So instead of using the Vanguard short-term bond index bond as sort of a cash position,
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.360]   because you wanna get some yield out of it while you're waiting to spend that money
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.760]   over the next two or three years, you use short-term tips money.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.800]   It would protect you from an unanticipated jump in inflation.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:33.320]   And it's just an alternative to not quite a money market, but a short-term bond fund.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.280]   >> The announcement had said that the expected maturity for
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.600]   the fund is somewhere around 2.7 years instead of 8 and a half,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.200]   which is what the current tips fund has.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:50.440]   So it's gonna be about one-third as responsive in price to movements and
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.400]   real interest rates.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.280]   So that's the reduced risk.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.800]   The, of course, drawback is that you're just learning lower returns,
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.720]   cuz they're short-term bonds.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:05.600]   >> Okay, the next question is from Modest.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.400]   Is Modest here?
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:14.640]   Modest asks, what is your view, pro and con, of stable value funds in 401(k) plans?
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.080]   What role should they play in a portfolio?
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.840]   >> Well, I put a post on this, actually, on both heads just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.400]   And I had people, I wanted people to go read an article by Scott Simon,
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:34.360]   who is a very talented attorney out in California, but also is a fiduciary
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.560]   attorney, and he also has a money management company out there.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.080]   If you go on the mobile heads and you look at stable value funds,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.320]   you look that up, this post will come in.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.520]   What you find is Scott looked under the hood of this, as other people have.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.320]   I know Larry Sweco did a lot of work on this as well.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:57.480]   And it really depends on what's under the hood, who you're dealing with.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:02.200]   Who is these insurance contracts that are being put into this stable value fund?
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.760]   Who issued them?
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.200]   So, I mean, it sure sounds good, but every time something sounds good and
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.360]   investing in it, you really need to look under the hood, right?
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.600]   Have you done articles on stable value?
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.160]   Larry, I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.960]   >> [LAUGH] >> Alan, I haven't written about them.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.400]   But I agree, it's what's under the hood.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.000]   The US government's thrift savings plan has a G fund,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.680]   which is essentially a stable value that pays almost as much as the bond.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.800]   And I've tried to get somebody from the government to hire me for
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.600]   one day, pay me $1, and fire me, cuz I would love to be in it.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:45.680]   But there's a reason why some are paying higher rates in that the company,
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.940]   in the 401(k) or 403(b), in the insurance company,
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.960]   signed a longer term contract when rates are higher.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.040]   But I tell clients that are in the stable value fund that are in insurance
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.720]   contracts that there is default risk.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.600]   And I suspect, others may argue with me, that most insurance
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:13.400]   companies would have gone under in 2008 without the government being allowed it.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:20.080]   >> On stable value funds, not to put too fine a point to it,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.480]   a company called Invesco, are you all familiar with that?
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:30.160]   Do they have a fairly good reputation in terms of stable value fund management?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.640]   >> Sorry, I'm not familiar with their products.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.680]   I mean, except for the fact that they own power shares.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.600]   >> Did you observe the stony stare from the audience?
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.100]   >> [LAUGH] >> I'm sorry?
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.320]   >> I said, do you observe the stony stare from the panel?
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.460]   >> [LAUGH] >> They're active managers, right?
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.680]   >> Yes, I believe so.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   >> I don't know. >> Eliminated choice.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.560]   >> Do they out aim?
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.280]   >> Yes, they do.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.520]   >> Yeah, there's always a trust factor.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.880]   >> I don't think of Invesco and AIM as one of the good guys.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.960]   >> I would say as a general statement, one thing I've noticed just anecdotally is
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:13.280]   that the stable value yields have come down quite a bit over the past year or two.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.120]   And I guess I get a little nervous when I see people looking at things that maybe
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.560]   will yield 3% versus just hunkering down.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.160]   If it's money that you truly need to keep safe,
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.000]   is that yield pickup really worth the risk?
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.440]   And maybe if you have an awful lot of money, it is.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.440]   But I think that people really should be mindful of anything that's promising and
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.640]   appreciably higher yield or even a modestly higher yield than true cash right now.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.840]   >> I mean, there is the odd free lunch out there.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:50.280]   Tia Cref, for example, has a very, the Tia traditional fund,
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.040]   which is basically a money market that if you got into it three or
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.160]   four years ago, still yields you 3%.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.520]   You can add more money to it, and I've looked under the hood of that.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.040]   It's a pretty darn good fund, it's got fairly solid holdings.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.440]   But what you're doing with that fund, of course,
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.640]   there's somebody who's paying for that.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.760]   The person who's paying for that are the people who have on the variable annuity
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.200]   side of that same fund who were stuck in it for years.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.120]   And so they can maintain the maturity.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.440]   And if you have an IRA in it, you don't have that constraint.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.180]   But it's a special situation, but if you qualify for Tia Cref,
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.960]   I think you can still get a percentage reward, as that was the last I looked.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.600]   >> Okay, we have a question from Steven Enter.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.120]   Did I pronounce your name correctly?
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.680]   All the way in the back.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:42.520]   He says, what allocation and disbursement strategy would you recommend for
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.720]   a retiree who has no heirs and would like to come as close as
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.560]   possible to depleting his assets without eventually depleting it?
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.700]   >> [LAUGH] >> I think the answer seems clear to me,
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.520]   that that's a perfect candidate for a single premium immediate annuity.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.380]   I don't know, anybody else?
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.500]   >> Yeah, it needs to be inflation adjusted though, because think of it,
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.780]   it's an annuity with a duration for the rest of your life.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:17.820]   So if we do get hyperinflation, your spending power is gonna go down and down.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.960]   And if you take the inflation adjusted, that's an extra insurance premium, and
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.600]   that drastically lowers the amount you're gonna be paid.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.440]   And then there's default risk as well.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.540]   >> Yeah, if you're gonna put a big portfolio,
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:36.960]   you have to realize that states have limits on the guarantee that they,
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:43.280]   it's not guaranteed by the states, but it's a state guarantee program.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:49.620]   And each state has different limits, I think the majority are around 200, 300,000.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.400]   >> 100,000.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:55.060]   >> Yeah, 100,000 potentially, but 300,000 total, I think, in some states.
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.060]   >> Some.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.340]   >> But anyway, you would have to check the state that you live in to make sure
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.780]   that you have the proper number.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:09.060]   And some people would suggest that you
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.180]   don't buy all of it from the same insurance company.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:16.800]   So you spread your risk around the insurance company going under.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.280]   While the guarantee, the way I understand the guarantees work or
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:28.120]   is similar to the FDIC, the bank fails, they try to get the other insurance
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:33.880]   company to pick up the slack, and the other insurance companies apparently pay into it.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.400]   But the bottom line is, is that you might not get your check or
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.740]   from an insurance company that goes belly up or has a problem.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:47.980]   So you want to spread your risk around as the insurance company does.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.140]   >> And delay social security, Jim.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.280]   >> One thing I've posted about on this that I think some of the others might have
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.020]   also recommended is the self-unwinding tip platter for the first 5, 10, 15 years.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:03.960]   And then a smaller amount of annuity at 75, 80, 85, for the last part.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.100]   Where you get the mortality credit, it's really an equal reward.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.360]   You wait, you delay it, you buy the annuity.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.480]   Could I just go to a 10,000 foot level on this question?
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.920]   Because it's actually an interesting question when you think about it.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:22.240]   The question was, I don't have any hair, so I want to spend every dime I have on
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.480]   my debt, but I want to pay the mortuary in that dime.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.060]   >> No, no, no, the check to the mortuary is supposed to balance it.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.000]   >> [LAUGH] >> Use a credit card.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.640]   >> [LAUGH] >> Okay, but here's the point.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.920]   The point is that from the 10,000 foot level, that's his situation.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.800]   So what asset allocation, what strategy should he use in his portfolio?
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.920]   What withdrawal strategy should he have, given the amount of money he has?
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.360]   Given social security, everything else that he's got coming in,
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.200]   to accomplish what he wants to accomplish.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.520]   It's gonna be very different than somebody who has four kids and
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.040]   wants each one of them to inherit, on an inflation adjusted basis,
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.880]   all the assets you have today.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.320]   The withdrawal rate is gonna be different.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.840]   So sometimes we'll get into the minutiae about what is the 4% withdrawal rate,
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   the optimal withdrawal rate, and we argue back and forth forever on this.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.800]   And the answer is, for him, it might be 6%.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.280]   For somebody who's 60 years old and has four kids and
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.880]   they want every dime to go to their four kids, it might be 3%.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.320]   So each one is very specific.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:36.720]   And the inheritance question is really gonna determine a lot,
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.360]   not only about asset allocation, but also the withdrawal strategy.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.240]   >> Clearly, I think the most applicable strategy here is the George Raft strategy.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.720]   You remember George Raft was the actor who said he spent $10 million on
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.040]   women, booze, and gambling, and the rest of it he wasted.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:59.760]   >> [LAUGH] >> I think the key to the recommendation
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.500]   is a unique situation, no errors, and wants to spend it all.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.640]   And that's pretty- >> Not unusual though, I mean-
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.080]   >> No, no, I'm saying though,
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.080]   it's unique to him and it's not so- >> But also it's not so
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.600]   unique in that for the vast majority of people, investors,
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.080]   they're, to maintain any semblance of a standard of living,
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.480]   they're gonna have to spend their assets down over time.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:29.760]   And I feel the important thing is to, again, establish a financial plan
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.640]   that allows you to visually see how you can spend it down at a rate
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.960]   that makes sense, and then readjust it every year based on inflation,
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.160]   based on what happens in the markets.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.840]   And also based on the biggest question mark of all in retirement is that is,
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.600]   what is your health care cost?
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   >> There's one more thing I wanna throw out there which we haven't heard yet,
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.920]   and that is reverse mortgage when you're home.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.360]   And I think that'll, for your situation,
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.480]   if you have a home, a reverse mortgage might be the thing you wanna do.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.360]   So we haven't talked about reverse mortgages as part of,
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.680]   you have talked about it, remember, in years past as part of this financial plan.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.480]   >> One other quick mention to back up to the annuity discussion.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.040]   Mel, you mentioned the idea of buying multiple annuities to spread the insurer
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.800]   risk.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.280]   I think there's another good reason to think about maybe laddering annuities,
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.000]   which is the current interest rate environment.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.480]   So single premium immediate annuities are quite low by historical standards right
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.360]   now due to the current interest rate environment.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.920]   So even though it would be more cumbersome than buying just a single
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.440]   immediate annuity and letting it ride, I think it does make sense to spread out
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   the purchases over a period of time to potentially obtain a range of interest
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.680]   rate environments.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.800]   >> On the topic of buying annuities,
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:45.720]   if you're looking to stay within the state guarantee association limits,
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.360]   it's important to note not only that the limit varies by state, but
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.920]   the applicable rules vary by state.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.360]   So for instance, some states will back you up,
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.320]   they'll make you whole in the event that the annuity defaults.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.160]   If you live in that state when it defaults, other states,
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.760]   their guarantee applies if you purchased the annuity when you lived in that state.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:14.960]   So for instance, if you currently live in a state that has a $300,000 limit and
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.080]   you're considering moving to another state in retirement,
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.820]   this is something you'll want to think about.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:24.640]   Because you don't want to move to a state with a $100,000 limit necessarily.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.440]   There are obviously factors involved in moving place and living.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.880]   But you'd want to pay attention to those rules and
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.320]   see if it's going to expose you to an additional level of credit risk.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:40.400]   >> Bill, didn't you write that if there's a systemic issue in the insurance
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.680]   industry, the state guarantee would be a little more than a speed bump?
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.160]   >> That was the word I used, yes.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:52.600]   >> And then I have a pet peeve, and everyone does this, including last night.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.200]   You can earn 7% income on an annuity.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.640]   Why would you, therefore, want to buy a 1.7% total bond fund?
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.680]   I've compared apples to oranges.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.720]   Most of the return on the single premium immediate annuity is your return
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:16.640]   on principal. >> Well, it's even better than principal.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.120]   It's the principal of the people who died before you.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:25.840]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.400]   >> There's a non-mobilized question from
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.920]   over there, gold coins or gold ETF? >> Gold coins, absolutely.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.920]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.320]   >> Gold coins.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.120]   I mean, look, if the Armageddon comes,
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.360]   is anybody going to want to buy your share of the GLD?
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.520]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.920]   >> If you can trade it,
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:49.120]   if the markets are even open, no, you're going to have those gold coins sitting in
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.520]   your safe next to your shotgun. >> [LAUGH]
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.240]   >> I'll play the straight man here.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:01.160]   More seriously, Craig Rowland wrote a wonderful book on the permanent portfolio.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.720]   He's got about 70 pages.
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.320]   It's just fascinating to read about why are you buying gold, okay?
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.920]   Are you buying it to hedge inflation?
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:12.200]   Well, then buy GLD, buy a gold miner.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.960]   I would even say buy just a natural resources fund, like the Energy Fund,
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:22.800]   all right, which is, in spite of Jack's comments, I think it's an excellent fund.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.320]   I think they'd find anything by bringing that fund out.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.560]   If, on the other hand, you're worried about breakdown of social order,
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:36.000]   then probably Canada's an animal hoarder, I would bet.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.560]   And if you're really concerned about the entire breakdown of society,
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.000]   then you want to put gold in a vault in New Zealand or Switzerland, all right?
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.480]   Which he tells you exactly how to do all this, it's absolutely fascinating stuff.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.920]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.000]   >> Seriously.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.800]   And then your only problem, of course, is finding a way out of the country.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.360]   >> [LAUGH] >> Okay,
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.960]   here's a comment and a question.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.880]   It says it seems every financial expert is saying to get out of bond funds this year.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.580]   Some say to buy individual bonds instead.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.080]   Bonds.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:20.000]   >> I'll just extend that, okay, well, what do bond funds hold?
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.240]   >> Exactly. >> Individual bonds.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.120]   All right, so what's the purpose of getting out of bond funds,
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.400]   to go into individual bonds?
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.400]   I can see doing a bond ladder if you have liabilities that have stepped out over ten
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:35.040]   years, so you're going to build a ten year ladder of tips, no problem.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.520]   You've got liabilities going out over five years, you want to buy a five year CV ladder,
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.520]   pick those liabilities.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.400]   Let's say college savings, you have children going to college,
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.840]   you want to buy, I used to buy zero coupon bonds for my children.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.760]   So I knew exactly what I had coming due every year for them to go to college.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.960]   That's a good reason to buy a bond.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:57.520]   You're retired, and you're going to be retired for 20 years, 25 years.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:02.220]   The liability, I mean, the duration of your liabilities are,
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.880]   if you add it all up, you do it mathematically,
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:10.560]   probably comes out to about five, six years, the duration of your liability.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.320]   The duration of an intermediate term bond fund is about five years.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.000]   Now, the next year, a year from now,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.960]   the duration of your liability doesn't come to four years, it stays at five years.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.000]   So what I'm saying is, with an intermediate term bond fund,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.960]   municipal bond, total bond market, the duration of your liabilities and
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.080]   the duration of your bond assets are about the same.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:35.680]   If you buy individual bonds, it complicates that.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.280]   And so I'm not a fan of doing that.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.520]   >> Well, let me take a vote then.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.080]   Bill, do you think that people should get out of bonds by this time?
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:44.720]   >> No.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.600]   >> Rick?
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.120]   >> No. >> Well, it depends.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.640]   Mike?
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.560]   >> No, but Alan probably has something to say about speeds.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.480]   >> [LAUGH] >> You said what I was going to say.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:59.040]   And- >> Well, I think it's very important that
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:04.440]   people have an understanding of what can happen to bond funds
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.600]   in a rising interest rate environment, and to basically stay the course.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:13.560]   Vanguard has an excellent piece on the importance of staying the course.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.600]   If you have an intermediate bond fund, when the price begins to drop,
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.880]   it's just, it's wonderful.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:24.360]   We show it to every client who has an intermediate term bond fund.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:28.520]   Because we're drilling in them the importance of not getting out of it when
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.040]   the net asset value starts to drop, but
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.160]   to stay there to capture the higher returns down the road.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.000]   So you're prepared for it when interest rates do go up.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.520]   It's just gonna be, the outflow of bond funds, dollars out of bond funds,
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.440]   when interest rates go up, they're just gonna be off the charts.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.280]   >> There are any number of phrases that you hear from time to time,
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.960]   that they all fall into the same category, which is the old 60/40 portfolio
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.440]   doesn't work anymore, indexing doesn't work anymore.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.560]   The traditional portfolio doesn't work anymore.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.480]   And don't buy a bond fund anymore, buy bonds.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:08.840]   They all say exactly the same thing, which is hold on to your wallet.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.160]   >> I would just like to add one thing to Bill's comment.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.400]   His 60/40 portfolio doesn't work.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.620]   A week and a half ago, there was a great article in the New York Times about
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.840]   endowment funds face hard landing.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.920]   And a guy, somebody did research on all these endowment funds.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.840]   And the conclusion that he came to is that a 60/40 low cost
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.080]   index fund portfolio is darn hard to beat.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.160]   And I posted it on my website, or you can email me.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.240]   It's a great article.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.840]   >> I'm a better actor, believe me.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:38.520]   >> What's that?
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.360]   >> [LAUGH] >> What?
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.340]   >> I wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal Total Return blog about a month
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.320]   and a half ago, I quoted Bill Bernstein in it.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:52.880]   But I walked through the simple math of owning a bond versus a bond fund.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.480]   And addressed the myth that if you own a bond and hold it to maturity,
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:02.400]   it's just an illusion that you eliminated interest rate risk.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.080]   >> All right, well, there was a method to that madness.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.160]   >> There's also, by the way, a cash drag on buying individual bonds.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.520]   Because people buy individual bond letters, interest coming in,
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.240]   what do you do with it?
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.880]   If you're not spending it, it sits there in the money market with 0% interest.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.240]   Do you have enough money until a bond comes due where you can go out and
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.240]   buy another bond?
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.400]   It actually drags down the yield of the portfolio.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.440]   >> That was brilliant and insightful, thank you very much.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.760]   >> [LAUGH] >> Well, there was a method.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.120]   >> Coming from you, that means something else.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.520]   >> [LAUGH] >> There was a method about madness in
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.520]   holding the account, because the question says,
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:42.360]   it seems every financial expert is saying to get out of bond firms.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.560]   We have a panel of experts here who said don't.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.080]   So every financial expert is not saying to get out of bond firms.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:55.400]   That's the answer that I will be taking out of that.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:02.840]   We have one final question here, and I think the answer should be fairly obvious.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:09.120]   But do you think it's reasonable to assume that no one can accurately predict
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.160]   how any asset class will perform for any length of time in the future?
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.860]   Yes.
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:21.520]   >> No, and the reason why I disagree with that is obviously the question,
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:25.800]   the way that people usually try to answer that is in the short term.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.480]   But in the long term, I think you can look at valuations and
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:34.600]   make a probabilistic statement, stocks are selling for 35 times earnings.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.400]   I think their future returns are going to be lower than when they're selling at 10
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.600]   times earnings, but that doesn't tell you what to do tomorrow.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.680]   >> Well, let me make sure you got that whole thing.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.640]   It says for any length of time.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.480]   >> Yeah. >> You're picking out particular-
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.760]   >> Yeah, yeah, for any length, yeah.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:54.240]   In other words, I would say for any period that's less than 15 or
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.720]   20 years, you can't do it.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:00.880]   >> Right, okay, so that was the reason I said no, because I don't consider it.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.800]   >> Okay, what is the question again, can you read it?
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:08.840]   >> Is it reasonable to assume that no one can accurately predict how any asset
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.600]   class will perform for any length of time in the future?
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.400]   So that would be short term, medium term, long term.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.480]   >> Is it reasonable to predict that no one can accurately predict.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:22.720]   >> Is it reasonable to assume- >> Assume.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:26.160]   >> Assume no one can predict.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:30.960]   >> Basically, any asset class will perform- >> Any asset class.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:38.600]   >> Any length of time, or any length of time would be one day into infinity.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.520]   >> I don't know.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.580]   >> [LAUGH] >> I think maybe a better way to rephrase
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:47.200]   that question is maybe you can't predict it, but
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:51.000]   what assumptions do you use in your financial planning process?
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.240]   And for that, I think going back to what Bill Bernstein said, and
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.480]   Vanguard alluded to last night, was the best predictor of interest rates or
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:03.680]   fixed income is what they're yielding now, I think.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:08.840]   And on the equity side, what Bill was saying was that, and
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:14.080]   I think everyone's saying maybe use 6 to 8% based on current valuations,
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.880]   dividend being a little bit less.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:20.480]   And use that as a starting point in your financial planning process,
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.480]   realizing that you may be off.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.040]   But you don't find out that if you're off 20 years from now and
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.200]   start making adjustments,
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.080]   you make adjustments along the way based on those assumptions.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.560]   >> Can I answer the question now that I have clarification?
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.040]   >> Sure, go for it.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.680]   >> I made predictions out 30 years, and I have actually sort of made predictions
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:42.800]   out 10 years, but if they're my expectations of return,
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.920]   I don't think that they should be used for,
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:52.800]   30 year out, the expected returns of asset classes are based on
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.480]   inherent risks of the asset class relative to each other.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.260]   So you've already saved asset classes like short term tips are going to give you
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:03.400]   a very low return because it's the safest in every aspect.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.720]   But as you go out further and further, you start taking more and more risk.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.120]   The riskiness of the asset class volatility, if you were part of that,
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:16.480]   you wouldn't invest in equities if they weren't riskier.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.160]   And if you wouldn't invest in equities,
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.680]   if you weren't expecting a higher rate of return because they're risky.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.920]   So you can make predictions in the very long run that stocks should outperform
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.360]   bonds, that bonds should outperform cash.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.840]   I mean, these are the types of predictions you can make.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.800]   I don't know how accurately you can make them, but I think you can make them.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:41.560]   >> How about a 30-year zero coupon [INAUDIBLE]
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.040]   >> Say again? >> Well, you know exactly what it was.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.080]   Exactly, thank you.
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.560]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:54.120]   >> Well, at this time I'd like to thank everyone for attending.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.840]   I have a few announcements to make, and some recognitions.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.880]   I want to remind everyone that the video will be available
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:10.280]   that Rich is making, it will be available online in the segments.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.400]   Is that correct, Rich?
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:11.960]   >> Right.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:17.080]   >> And either Rich or I will make a post on the forum when they are available to
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:17.840]   alert you to that.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:24.560]   After it's all done, are we gonna do a DVD this year, or are we just gonna go online?
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:30.440]   Everything will be online this year, so you won't even have to order the DVD.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:38.160]   At this time, I'd like to recognize the people who really make this event work.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:43.520]   I've got an all-star team, and believe me, couldn't pull it off without them.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:49.000]   There's a million and one details that go on in putting this event on, and
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.840]   we actually work for over a year to do it.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:56.480]   We're already starting to plan on next year's event.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.780]   So I would like to call up my all-star staff, Ed Rager,
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:03.520]   Patty Rager, Paul and Linda Berenson.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:13.520]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.800]   >> Mel and Kathy Turner.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:24.680]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.080]   >> When I was in the business world,
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:32.160]   when I delegated something, you still had to worry about whether people
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.800]   were gonna be executed or not, you had to follow up.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.920]   But with these people here, when I delegate, I just cross off the list,
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.800]   because these people are great, you know it's gonna be done.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.000]   We started a tradition last year of trying to give pins out that matched
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.280]   the gift that we gave to Jack.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:54.680]   This year, we gave Jack a Independence Hall, and
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.880]   we have the matching pins that go with Independence Hall.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:02.520]   And I'd like to give one to each of the staff.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:12.520]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.400]   >> We have one more important part of
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.360]   the program, there's a lot of organizations that form.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.160]   Very few of them succeed, and even fewer of them flourish,
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.080]   like the Bogleheads in particular.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.440]   It's done due to not only hard work, but leadership.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:50.280]   And they have exceptional people that make it all happen.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.720]   And the spouses put up with the insanity to make it all happen.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.000]   But the glue that holds the flourishing groups
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   together is due to leaders that you wanna follow.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.400]   And in our organization, we have one of those leaders that's here up on the podium.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.480]   Mel gives his talent and all of his energy to keep this going.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.760]   So I think we should all give a thank you to my fellow Marine, Mel Lindauer.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:27.760]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.480]   >> We have a couple of other people that
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.080]   we wanna recognize, Lady Geeks, Sue.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:43.440]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.280]   >> Is Ed Tower here?
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.780]   Okay, Ed, who put on the, who worked on the.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:59.780]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.040]   >> And I'd also like to say that we
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.880]   have a group of volunteers every year who man the doors,
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:15.040]   work the registration tables, and do a lot of other chores.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.040]   Would all the volunteers please stand up and be recognized?
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.160]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:33.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
