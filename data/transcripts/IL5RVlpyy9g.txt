[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980]   Welcome to the BogleHedge Chapter Series.
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.460]   This episode was jointly hosted by the Starting Out in the Pre and Early Retirement Life Stage
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.080]   Chapters and recorded September 13th, 2023.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.740]   The presentation and discussion topic was Estate Planning with Attorney Summerfield
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.740]   Baldwin.
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.220]   BogleHedge are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.280]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.480]   investment advice.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.260]   Featured guest tonight, Summerfield Baldwin.
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.100]   Miriam did a basic intro.
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.740]   I'll elaborate on that a little just so folks know a bit more about Summerfield's background.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.220]   Summerfield grew up in Brooklyn, New York.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.340]   He has a BA from Johns Hopkins and his law degree from Brooklyn Law.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.220]   He's licensed in New York, so his comments will largely be based on his knowledge of
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.440]   his practice in New York.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.480]   He started that practice in 1993 specializing in estates and guardianships.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.940]   In his practice, he's served as a trustee of various trusts and as a guardian, guardian
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.860]   ad litem, which we may or may not get into.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.580]   He served as a court evaluator and attorney for alleged incapacitated persons in a variety
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.380]   of Supreme and surrogate court cases.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.620]   Summerfield and his wife and his cat live in New York, just north of New York City,
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.500]   but will be moving back to Brooklyn to be closer with family.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.620]   And in full disclosure, I have retained Summerfield for his services, and I also consider Summerfield
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.000]   a personal friend.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.440]   So with that, we'll begin what will largely, hopefully, be conversational.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.120]   We have many questions to ask Summerfield.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.220]   As Miriam mentioned, we'll have two sessions with Summerfield.
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.900]   This first will largely be the building blocks for legal understanding, and the second session,
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.280]   which will be scheduled within, it'll be a few months from now, likely, will be more
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.980]   of the people side of things like elder care and implementing care and guardianship and
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.740]   custody and moving residents and the complicated people side of things.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.260]   So we understand how sprawling this topic is and how relatable and how inevitable and
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.060]   how there's general interest, whether you're experiencing it or not right now.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.100]   But when I say inevitable, almost everyone is encountering these issues.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.380]   So with that, there's a near infinite amount of questions.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.140]   So we have a lot to cover, limited time.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.980]   We want to turn it over to the questions from the chat.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.380]   So I will sometimes, unfortunately, cut off Summerfield.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.420]   We want to keep things concise.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.700]   We're going to want to move on to different categories of questions.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.540]   So if folks can, again, submit questions in the chat, and, you know, we hope everyone
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.220]   gets a lot out of this.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.940]   Summerfield, did you have anything you wanted to add before we start?
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.500]   Oh, just, I appreciate your having me on.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.580]   I've been an admirer of Vanguard and their philosophy and, of course, John Vogel.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.900]   And I appreciated our working together and friendship, Gorrie, so glad to be here.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   Excellent.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.740]   Well, thanks again for being here.
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.180]   It is such a topic of interest for such a wide group of people.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.940]   And you mentioned Jack Vogel and Vanguard.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.580]   And so the Vogel Heads span, this audience is certainly national, and sometimes we have
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.980]   international folks.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.340]   So with that, it's an important point, I'll reiterate, folks will have very state-specific
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.340]   questions sometimes.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.260]   And there are questions relating to internationally held assets or beneficiaries located elsewhere.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.020]   We are aware that that's a topic of interest, but we're also going to curtail some of those
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.060]   so that we can focus on what's most relatable for the broadest audience.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.180]   So Summerfield, thank you for that.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.180]   And again, for context, as you know, there's a wide range of, not just geographically,
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.380]   but age and kind of personal interest.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.700]   So with that, why don't we get started with the most basic of questions.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.580]   Can you walk us through what a will is, what goes on in the absence of a will, and why
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.660]   it's important to have one?
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.660]   Sure.
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:49.340]   A will is a legal document whereby when you've passed away, the will controls how your property
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:58.940]   is going to pass, and it also nominates, and it was called an executor, someone to control
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.060]   and operate the estate.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.700]   And a will needs to be a writing.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.820]   Most typically, it's a paper writing.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.820]   I've never encountered anything different, although in law school, I know there was a
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.180]   case in England centuries ago, where some farmer had written his will on the back of
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.980]   a farm animal, on a cow or something.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.660]   And that was actually held up by the English court at that time.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.540]   So yeah, writing.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.260]   One of the requirements of a will is that it be published by the person making out the
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.260]   will.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.980]   So when I supervise a will signing, I always ask my client two questions.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.620]   I say, one, is this your will?
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.620]   Person says yes.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.580]   And then I ask, are you asking the three of us to witness the signing of your will and
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.900]   do a self-proving affidavit?
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.980]   They say yes, that's the publication.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.420]   And then they sign the document.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:07.260]   The will in New York, as it would be in other states, needs to be witnessed by at least
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.020]   two adults.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.540]   And for my will signings, I generally have the witnesses do what's called a self-proving
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.300]   affidavit where they basically attest to the fact that the testator was of sound mind,
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.700]   that they were not being unduly forced into signing their will, that they had understanding,
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.820]   they could read English, knew the English language, they had no physical defect, vision
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.120]   or hearing problem that would affect their capacity to make a will.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.260]   So Summerfield, sorry, I'll interrupt from time to time just for clarity.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.260]   So two things.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.700]   One is when you said two witnesses, I assume, but you'll clarify, these have to be disinterested
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.700]   parties.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.060]   It wouldn't be a beneficiary or relative or could it be?
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:03.220]   As a practical matter, the answer is yes, although technically it can be an interested
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.220]   party.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:13.740]   The catch, though, is if a beneficiary is a witness, they have a choice or the estate
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.100]   has a choice.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.940]   They can either withdraw as a witness or they can withdraw as being a beneficiary.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.580]   They can't serve in both those roles.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:30.540]   So yes, you would never like I would never want my client to have as his or her witness
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.680]   someone that he's included in his will as a beneficiary.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   That helps.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.180]   So I want to follow up on what it means to be published for folks outside of the legal
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.180]   space.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.100]   But before that, I want to close this point.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.520]   Can you elaborate on how these witnesses are sourced?
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.300]   If the average person doesn't know how to find a disinterested person, does the attorney
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.820]   provide them or how else is it done?
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:04.900]   How I do it, most of most of my will signings are done in my office and I on my floor, there's
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:11.420]   a receptionist, sort of a receptionist who serves a whole number of offices.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.740]   And she is usually my my lead witness.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.420]   And then she, in turn, because she's sort of the property manager for the building,
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.940]   she will usually call in another staff person at the building and the two of them are my
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.300]   witnesses and I serve as sort of a third witness.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:37.880]   If I do a home visit to a person for their will signing, then I make arrangements beforehand.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.540]   I'll say to them, look, are there some neighbors or do you have friends who could come by and
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.180]   and serve as the as the witnesses and usually that that works out well.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.180]   Fantastic.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.460]   That was super clear.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.420]   So now let's go back to being published.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.580]   You said it must be published for folks, again, without the the legal knowledge.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.960]   What is what does that mean to the average person?
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.940]   How how what defines published as it satisfies you?
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:13.840]   Yeah, just like a declaration to the to the witnesses that the person intends this document
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.100]   to be their last will and testament to dispose of their assets at their death and set up
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.540]   their estate.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.820]   And it goes partly into this whole thing of does the person know what they're doing?
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.380]   You know, one of the big concerns about a will, you know, oftentimes you have older
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.420]   people doing a will.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:40.380]   And of course, with age can come some form of mental decline.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:49.420]   And and so you want your witnesses to feel confident that, in fact, the person signing
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.940]   the will before them knows what they're doing, knows what's going on.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:10:01.340]   And so the publication requirement sort of goes towards establishing that that confidence
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.340]   in that.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:08.000]   OK, so I wanted to hit on this later, but it's timely, given what you just said.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.100]   If someone contests the will and says those witnesses were not qualified to make a determination
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.620]   that the decedent was of sound mind, how would that be handled?
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:29.300]   Let's say someone went in and out, had had some early history of being in and out of
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:36.460]   lucidity, wasn't clearly suffering from, you know, full dementia or Alzheimer's.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:43.080]   But in this hypothetical, some beneficiary or potential beneficiary or excluded otherwise
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.140]   beneficiary could say not of sound mind, those witnesses were not qualified to make
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.140]   that determination.
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.140]   Right.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.140]   Yes.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.140]   That can they can do that.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:01.720]   The thing I mean, the best argument for a will object and regarding the witnesses would
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:08.500]   be, in my opinion, would be on the one hand, all the witnesses were under age, you know,
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.140]   because legally the witness has to be an adult, 18 or older.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.020]   So if if you can establish that a witness was 16 or something, then that, you know,
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.980]   you win your objection that way.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:29.100]   I think a second strong object and argument to a witness would be the witness was was,
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:36.020]   you know, not not an independent, true witness.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.300]   They were maybe maybe they received some money.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.060]   Maybe they were paid by the testator or the attorney or something.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.740]   There was there was some kind of fraud going on.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:52.160]   There was this plan to defraud a vulnerable person.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.620]   And the witnesses were part of a scheme to do that.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:01.820]   So I mean, I suppose you could argue that a witness is not doesn't have a particular
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.980]   qualification to determine whether someone has capacity or not.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.100]   And I mean, if you could establish that a witness themselves had some kind of disability
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.180]   that would limit their ability to understand, that might be successful.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.820]   But generally, courts are used to witnesses being just sort of regular folks that aren't
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.060]   expected to have any particular knowledge or, you know, great qualifications.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.060]   All right.
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.060]   That helps.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.740]   So it's a low bar to make that determination.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.260]   Yes, it sounds like.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:35.820]   OK, so let's say you've described what a will is, what it does, what happens in the absence
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.340]   of a will.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.460]   Someone intended to do will started it, never finished it.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.900]   There's a partial will count.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.500]   Does it need to be officially complete or let's say there's no will.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.500]   Right.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.500]   Yes.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.580]   In those cases, I mean, in some case, in the ideally, if you haven't done a will, you've
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:59.700]   done other things, you've made beneficiary designations on your life insurance, on your
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:08.380]   bank accounts, on your pension or annuity that you may have such that.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.300]   There's really nothing.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.840]   Everything is accounted for.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.060]   Everything is provided for.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.380]   Nothing will really come into your estate or if things do come into your estate, they're
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:23.380]   so small, some kind of refunds or a very small account that it just it doesn't make sense
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:29.620]   to hire an attorney to take the time and effort to go and and probate or handle the estate.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:35.060]   So that would be the ideal situation for someone who doesn't do a will.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:41.020]   If if you don't do a will and you don't do the beneficiary designation or a trust or
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:53.220]   whatnot and property legally passes to your estate, then what has to happen is a.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:14:00.700]   Distributee, which is a legal term for someone who's a close family member who, by virtue
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:07.460]   of their kinship, would inherit under the state intestacy law, a distributee needs to
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:14.460]   come forward and file a petition for letters of administration to be appointed as the it's
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.460]   not executor.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:21.220]   If there's no will be appointed as the administrator of the estate with the authority to marshal
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:29.780]   the assets, pay the estate expenses and then distribute the estate assets to those closest
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.220]   blood can as determined by the state law.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.540]   OK, super helpful.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.820]   So building on what you just said, I want to pick up on two things.
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:46.340]   One is you mentioned if someone has relatively minimal assets or however subjective that
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:55.100]   is, but in what situations is it OK to do a will yourself or hire an attorney versus
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.140]   use an online tool?
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.300]   And then you mentioned executor.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:05.820]   Why don't we segue after you address those if you can elaborate on the role of an executor,
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:12.980]   how to choose a good one, how to inform them what it means to be an executor.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.620]   So they're agreeing to something in an informed way.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.500]   Great questions that before I get to those questions, and I may have to nudge you to
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.260]   remind me of them, but there is one point I should make that could be helpful to people
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.380]   with it in these small estate situations in New York.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.420]   And again, most states, although laws vary, do have similar type arrangements.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:46.980]   But in New York, if you have a very small estate, I think it's up to 20,000, 30,000,
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:53.140]   even without a will and without doing a court proceeding at the surrogates court, there
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.860]   are provisions under the New York law where you can go to your bank or whoever is holding
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.340]   the small assets and you can fill out an affidavit.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:07.220]   And just by virtue of that affidavit and a particular section of the New York law, the
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:14.260]   bank, the financial institutions are required to turn over those small assets, so just something
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.580]   to bear in mind.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.540]   And then the nudge, you were in terms of...
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:27.740]   Oh, well, so to finish up, let's say, so people have, they've definitely seen online they
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:35.660]   can do their own will versus they get comfort with an attorney versus someone has a friend
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.140]   who did it themselves and feel fine.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.820]   When is it okay and when should someone absolutely hire an attorney?
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.820]   Right.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:51.020]   I mean, personally, my advice would be to...
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.620]   My best advice, I think, would be just to go to an attorney.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:17:00.020]   And you can check with an attorney about their fees ahead of time and all of that.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:08.360]   Now, but that being said, if you feel comfortable, like maybe you have some experience with the
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.580]   state matters, wills, that sort of thing.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:17.340]   If you want to draft your own will, I think that's just by yourself or with one of these
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.340]   will kits.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.800]   I don't particularly have a problem with that.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:30.400]   You should be careful about, in terms of, you want to make sure you select all the people
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.560]   that should be selected, executors, backup executors.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.880]   If you have children, you want to have guardians, backup guardians.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.000]   You want to make sure you cover all the bases, but drafting your own will, I don't particularly
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.900]   frown upon.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:52.120]   But if you do that, I would recommend that you do have an attorney, at least supervise
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.320]   the execution of the will signing.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:03.960]   And that, in terms of fees, that should be, I would estimate like a third or a fourth
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:10.040]   of what an attorney would charge for the entire process, because most of the attorney time
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.680]   goes into drafting the will.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:18.480]   If you come with a will to an attorney, and I've had a couple of clients do this, and
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.400]   I as the attorney, I'm just there to supervise the signing, that's not a big deal, and my
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.480]   fee is going to be considerably less.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:38.400]   And the reason for that is that, like I mentioned earlier, the New York statute has very specific
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:45.160]   laws about what constitutes a valid will signing.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:53.000]   And the self-proving affidavits that the witnesses have to sign, ideally they're done at the
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.540]   will signing.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:19:00.080]   They don't have to be, but it's much easier to get the witnesses to do these required
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:08.360]   affidavits at the will signing than it is to track them down 20, 30 years later, and
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.600]   then have them sign affidavits at that point.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:19.560]   So yeah, that, and then a final thing, like if someone's going to object to a will, just
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.480]   the fact that you've had an attorney supervise the will signing, that gives the surrogate
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.960]   judges a lot more confidence that it was done properly, as opposed to you went before a
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.200]   notary at FedEx or something.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.920]   So just for the purpose of having the will hold up, I'd have an attorney supervise it,
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.880]   even if you do draft your own will.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.820]   - Okay, that was super clear and helpful.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:48.240]   There's a lot there that I think is worth following up on, so I'm going to focus on
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.880]   a few things, but we'll move into sort of speed dating round.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.520]   I'll ask questions and we'll do like high level, concise answers.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.520]   We'll get back to executors.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.080]   So you mentioned a few things.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.560]   Coming to an attorney with a self-drafted will would be helpful.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.760]   How does one, I think we know referrals are a great source for choosing an attorney, but
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.080]   absent that is the bar association, or how would you recommend someone find a good attorney
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:23.440]   outside of casting a wide Google search and then bringing the draft?
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.320]   So if one is going to self-draft, should they follow an online template?
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.440]   How do they know that they have good guidance for the draft they're using?
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:39.160]   - Right, that's kind of tricky, yeah, because I really don't have experience with working
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.400]   with the different programs and stuff.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.040]   I mean, I had one person come to me, and this was a well-educated person, a friend, and
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:54.840]   he had gotten a hold of a program that was really quite complex and involved.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.040]   And I suppose it could have been good, but, and he did what sort of what I had recommended
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.360]   in that he had me look it over and I was going to supervise the signing.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.760]   But to me, it was really too involved.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:15.640]   I would favor a simpler program, or even, maybe even more so than a program.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:21.680]   If you have like your grandfather's will or your parents' will that a lawyer drafted,
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.960]   maybe just take that as your template and just kind of copy it and change it to pertain
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.760]   to your situation.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.000]   And that could even be free.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.360]   You wouldn't have to pay for, I would prefer something simpler, because if you go have
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.080]   too much complexity, you're going to confuse yourself, confuse the court.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.840]   So simpler is better that way.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   - Excellent.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.960]   So ultimately, it should not, it need not be a highly technical document and someone
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.640]   can intuitively draft it, and that might be a great foundation.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.640]   Okay.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:08.360]   If it needs to be complex and all this, then your wisdom, go to an attorney, because if
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.720]   it's really, you know, you just, you know, so.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   - Understood.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   Okay.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   So quick thoughts on how to find or select an attorney.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.720]   - Yeah.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:27.160]   Word of mouth, some, I know some companies have legal plans where for a discount, and,
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.440]   you know, I think that's worth exploring, you know, I think those guys could very well
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.360]   be good attorneys.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.960]   And then, yeah, bar associations, county bar associations have legal referral services
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:46.000]   where they have qualifications and everything for attorneys to register with them and they
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   keep an eye on them.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.160]   So that's a good source as well.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.160]   - Great.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.040]   So some great resources there.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.840]   I definitely want to jump to executor, but to close out the physical will process, does
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.840]   it need to be registered or filed somewhere?
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.960]   - No, in New York, it doesn't.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.240]   In New York, you can file it with your, the surrogates court in the county in which you
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:19.720]   live, but there's a catch to that, which in my opinion, and every client I've spoken with,
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:24.840]   it's a deal killer for them, and what the deal is, is that you file it at the local
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.760]   county surrogates court, you pay like a $35 filing fee.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:35.380]   The catch is though, if you ever want to change your will, you yourself have to physically
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.600]   go to the court and withdraw that original will.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.080]   You can't send your spouse, you can't send a power of attorney.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.480]   Even if you're on death's door, it has to be you who goes to the court to pull it out.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:53.920]   So for that reason, it's not my top recommendation, so.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.920]   - Okay.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.640]   So building on that, who should keep, let's say the will is finalized and there are no
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.720]   changes being made, who should have a copy of the will?
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:11.100]   How many copies should be distributed and how do you know that the latest, how does
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:21.920]   the judge or the executor or the post-passing, how do parties know what the latest will is?
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   - Right.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.160]   No, this is a very good question.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:34.840]   Yeah, well, a standard clause in any will is that it revokes any prior wills.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.960]   And so then you're, so you see that in virtually every will.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:45.080]   - But if you don't know that there's a later one, any document saying it revokes preceding
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.680]   ones can seem like the most common.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:58.600]   So basically, yeah, I mean, you would have to, right, yeah, I mean, there is a default
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:06.700]   paragraph in the standard court petition asking for the probate of the will, where you say
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:13.200]   that you've done a thorough search and that this is the latest will kind of thing.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:20.240]   And I guess you just have to, whether it's from the attorney who drafted the will or
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:29.680]   kept it or from your search of the decedent's home, you just have to, I guess, yeah, to
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.760]   the extent you can, be sure that it's the most recent will.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:42.660]   What some people will do is they'll, if they redo a will, they'll make sure they get their
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:49.100]   prior originals and just tear them up physically, just so that kind of a situation can't be.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.660]   - Okay, that makes sense.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:57.740]   And so in your experience is, how often have you seen a surprise later version surface
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.380]   after what was thought to be the latest?
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.260]   - Right, to be honest, I have not actually seen that.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:18.700]   I remember I assisted a gentleman, a colleague who had drafted a will for an older client
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:28.320]   and there was a contest and the specific issue you mentioned about not knowing if there was
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:36.000]   a more recent will didn't come up, but there were several prior wills and that came into
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.560]   the part of the objection.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.680]   So we dealt with a different number of wills, but specifically, no, I haven't seen what
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   you described.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:51.240]   - Okay, so that could be comforting for folks just knowing it's a low probability, low frequency
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   event.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.600]   - Yes, and one thing, if I could just jump in, one thing that'll help prevent what you've
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.040]   described is missing a more recent will.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.720]   Whenever you submit a will to be probated in New York, and again, this should apply
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:13.160]   to all states, there's a requirement that the closest blood can be notified, be provided
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:19.880]   a copy of that will, and they have the opportunity to object to that will.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:28.720]   So the fact that you're alerting spouse, kids, siblings, parents, or whatever, of the will,
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.600]   they're the kind of people who would know or potentially would know if there's a more
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.080]   recent will out there.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.240]   So if they see something that seems too old, doesn't seem right, then they just go to the
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.760]   court and say, "There's something wrong here," and so that it could come to light that way.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   - Got it.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.760]   Thank you.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.320]   So let's jump over to executor demystification.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:28:00.280]   So have you seen someone asked to be an executor, accept the role, but doesn't really have an
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.320]   understanding of what it entails?
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.760]   They feel obligated.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.960]   How does one empower a potential executor to make an informed decision?
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.720]   So if you can walk us through what it means to be an executor, what they typically do
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:21.080]   deal with, can they decline midstream and find a successor executor?
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.860]   How does that- - Yeah, I'll answer that one first.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.880]   You can decline midstream and sometimes it's unavoidable.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:36.040]   If you have a health issue or you have to move, or sometimes there can be some kind
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.180]   of problems with the estate where just in order to get the estate resolved, you need
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:46.880]   to step aside and let someone else take over because of family issues or something.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   So sometimes that's unavoidable.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:59.140]   It's generally better not to sign up to be the executor at the beginning, because if
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:04.400]   you feel, if you've been nominated as the executor and you're questioning whether you
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:11.700]   want to do it or not, or can do it, if you go ahead and accept, then to get yourself
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.380]   out of that is a process.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.980]   You can't just sign a letter or something and send it to the court and that's it.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:24.480]   You basically have to reapply to the court for permission to withdraw.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:30.760]   And if it's gotten to the stage where you've taken hold of property, if you've administered
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:37.200]   money, access money, put it in a state account, then you need to provide an accounting of
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.940]   how you've handled that money before the court will release you.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.560]   So just sort of a warning that way.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   But yes.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.560]   I mean-
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.960]   When you say a state account, who sets that up?
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.680]   The executor is empowered to-
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   Yes, exactly.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:57.560]   Yeah, because an executor, I mean, another way of looking at the executor role is it's
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:06.040]   basically the person who steps in the shoes of the decedent and can and does do what the
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.760]   decedent would be doing if they were still alive.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:17.520]   So they're gone, so someone needs to be able to act for them for the purposes of carrying
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   out their last wishes.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:25.780]   And so more specifically to demystify for folks who are zero familiarity, what are typical
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.600]   things an executor does?
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.640]   And if you can build on that, what makes for a great executor and what are some unanticipated
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:43.540]   pitfalls, some things that executors aren't really foresightful to, things that an executor
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.120]   may not have foreseen and tripped over.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   Right.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.120]   I don't know.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:55.740]   To me, I think there's kind of two things that make a great executor.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:00.940]   Probably the most important, I'd say, is just having that connection, that loyalty to the
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:08.420]   person that passed away, such that you really want to honor and fulfill their own wishes.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:16.260]   And whether it be to paying their last bills, making sure that the doctor, the home care
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:23.460]   worker, the cleaner, people that were important to them in their lives, those people get properly
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:30.460]   paid for the services that they did, but that the decedent wasn't able to pay during his
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.660]   last illness.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:40.700]   Honoring the decedent's wishes to leave gifts to charity, to cherished friends and family
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:46.420]   members, having a real devotion to the person means that you're going to, that kind of an
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:53.320]   executor is going to go the extra mile to, in a timely and caring way, carry out those
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.700]   person's last wishes.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.740]   So to me, that's the most important aspect.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:07.540]   And then the second aspect I would say is just kind of maybe a general good sort of
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:15.500]   organizational business affairs kind of sense, because the executor really is the person
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.580]   in charge of the estate.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:24.340]   And you don't have to necessarily have specialized knowledge or abilities, like either for investing
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:34.340]   or legally or that kind of thing, because as long as the estate is not really small,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:40.100]   it's customary and fine to hire an attorney to help you with the legal aspects, hire an
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:47.300]   accountant to help you with tax aspects to the extent they exist, hire an investment
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.340]   person to make some investment decisions if the estate is going to go on for a little
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.340]   period.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.340]   Okay.
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.780]   And it's, it sounds worth mentioning the executor can be compensated.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.700]   Is it predefined by the decedent early on?
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.660]   Is it a formula of assets?
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.660]   Is it a service?
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.940]   How does that work?
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.380]   Is it per service?
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:16.500]   It's in the, it's in the, the person making the will, it's in their control.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:23.260]   They can specify in their will, I want my executor to be compensated with X amount of
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:29.100]   dollars or X percentage of the estate, or sometimes they'll say, I direct my executor
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.940]   to serve without compensation.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:40.740]   That's it's, it's rare for people doing their wills to make that kind of a specification.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:49.980]   The 99% of the time, the executor simply takes as his or her commission, the percentage that's
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.060]   set by the state statute.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:34:00.060]   And to give an example, like in New York state for the first $100,000, and in the state,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.660]   the commission is 5%.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:10.780]   For the next $200,000 after that first $100,000, it's 4% of that, then it's 3% of every dollar
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.980]   from 300,000 up to 700,000.
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.660]   After 700,000, it's two and a half percent.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:21.860]   And then I think at a higher level, it even goes down to like 2%.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.300]   Okay, that's a perfect segue.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.060]   That's phenomenally important information.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.380]   So thank you, Summerfield.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:33.380]   When let's define the denominator there, as we segue to what is probate.
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.620]   So I'm conscious of our time, we're already near 840.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:44.460]   And we've covered a fraction of, you know, what we'd like to, when, let's say, a lot
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:50.460]   of folks in the Boglehead crowd know that financial institutions often require naming
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.300]   a beneficiary.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:35:00.220]   And so that will bypass, even if a will directed otherwise, the financial institution will
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.100]   follow what's on their records as the beneficiary.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:10.580]   So when you say the first $100,000, and then the next $200,000, et cetera, can you clarify
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:17.500]   for folks, does this include financial assets excluded if went to a beneficiary already?
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.380]   And then with that, we'll segue to probate.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.100]   Oh, definitely, definitely.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:28.180]   So, so it would be these percentages only apply to assets that come into the estate.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:34.540]   So so like, yeah, if you have an account at Vanguard, let's say you have two accounts
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.540]   at Vanguard.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:43.220]   Let's say one account for $500,000, you leave to your, your spouse.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:48.900]   Then when you pass away, leave to your spouse via the financial institutions form, right?
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.420]   We have the form, yeah, the spouse is the designated beneficiary with Vanguard.
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:36:00.700]   Then yeah, when you pass away, by operation of law at death, that $500,000 goes directly
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.140]   to your spouse, it doesn't come into your estate.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.540]   And so it's not part of your estate, and the executor's commission doesn't apply to that.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:16.860]   If you had a second account at Vanguard for $250,000, and let's say you designated the
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:26.000]   beneficiary on the Vanguard form as your estate, then in that case, that $250,000 would come
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.420]   into the estate, and the executor would get a commission based on the percentage amount.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:36.900]   And that would be the equivalent of having no beneficiary named also, the outcome would
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.100]   be the same to the estate.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.460]   Correct, right, it wouldn't go.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.860]   Most people don't do this.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:50.140]   Most people want it to go out of the estate directly to the family person or an individual.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:55.140]   But yeah, but for for some planning purposes, you may want to have the assets actually come
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.740]   into the estate.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:03.140]   And in that case, yeah, it would the $250,000 would come into the estate and be administered
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.220]   under the will, however, the will specifies.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.220]   Great.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.540]   So with that, again, this, this audience, a lot of Bogleheads are super educated on
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.540]   many things.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:19.620]   But we also have folks who don't have such a deep foundation.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:25.300]   Can you walk us through intro to probate, nuances, intricacies?
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.640]   What does it mean?
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.780]   When is it relevant?
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.420]   How to how to have it go optimally?
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.420]   Absolutely.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.420]   Sure.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:37.500]   Well, one thing, one thing that's, that's very important.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.500]   And I, we touched on this a little bit earlier.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.980]   But this whole idea of knowing your closest blood can, you know, because, again, you can
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:53.380]   leave your property to anyone you want, you can disinherit, well, you can disinherit
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:38:00.380]   your spouse, although in New York, and again, in most states, they have a legal right to
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.020]   file a right of election for at least one third of your estate.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.860]   So that way, you can't totally lock out a spouse.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:15.180]   But legally, you can disinherit children, parents, siblings, family, anybody.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:21.300]   And is there a specific language that holds up really well, assuming it can be contested?
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   Right?
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:30.060]   Well, what some people do is they'll, like, if, if they want to, if they're concerned
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:36.940]   that a, say, a disaffected child may contest a will that leaves most of the property to
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:45.740]   other children or someone else, they'll say, okay, I'll, I'll leave my child $30,000.
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.460]   But on the condition that they don't contest my will, if they do contest the will, then
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.380]   they get nothing.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:58.540]   Another, another recommended step is if you are disinheriting someone that you naturally
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.180]   would be expected to include in your will, you just do out an affidavit, just giving
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:09.580]   the reasons, you know, why you're doing that.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:17.380]   And then of course, I mean, sometimes if some attorneys will do a video tape of a will execution
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:24.180]   signing, if, if they fear there'll be, might be a contest or something, just to have a
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:28.580]   little evidence, a little more evidence that the testator was of sound mind at the time,
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.580]   that kind of thing.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.580]   Makes sense.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.260]   You're probably seeing more and more of that.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:42.660]   In your example of conditionally disaffected child will inherit $30,000 if they don't contest.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:49.820]   But let's say they have a strong case to contest and could be entitled or awarded to a lot
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.340]   more than 30, such that they take this risk.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:40:00.260]   In your example, if they win the contest, but the will said excluded, if they contest,
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.700]   how would that play out?
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.700]   Right.
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:08.580]   So if they win the contest, then the will is thrown out totally.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:14.460]   And then it goes, it's as if they, the person had no will, and then you look to the default
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.100]   in test to see law for the state.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.860]   And that's going to say closest blood can.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.980]   And in New York, it's the first 50,000 goes to the spouse.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.640]   There's a spouse and half of the remainder.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.620]   And then the other half of the remainder would be divided equally amongst the children.
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:41.180]   So in that scenario, I mean, if the child was an only child and his or her father had
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:44.380]   no spouse, then they would inherit everything.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.200]   But depending on the family situation, it could vary.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.300]   And that's the reason why when I do a will intake, I always try to get the names and
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:58.220]   addresses of closest blood can, even if they're not in the will, because these people have
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:04.200]   to be notified at death and given an opportunity to object to a will.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:12.540]   And if they can't be found or unknown, the court is going to hold up probate until there's
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:17.620]   like a due diligence search to either locate these people, give them the opportunity to
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:22.980]   object or else satisfy the court that a thorough search has been done.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:30.940]   And then even after a thorough search has been done, the court's going to want a publication
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:36.040]   of the official notice of the opportunity to object to the estate to be put in a newspaper
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.460]   and run.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.780]   It's just part of the legal requirements.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:40.780]   Okay.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.420]   So I want to follow up briefly on two things you mentioned, and then we still will revisit
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:50.220]   probate what it is exactly, what it means to go through it.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:55.100]   So two things, when you said, if the person wins the contest, the whole will is thrown
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.100]   out.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:01.300]   Is that the case for any contest or can a will be challenged in part and the rest of
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.300]   it stand?
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.060]   That's the first.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:09.620]   And then I want to plant the second and I'll hold you to it so that we don't forget.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.580]   You mentioned closest blood can.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.580]   What about step-relatives?
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.580]   Step-relative?
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:24.860]   No, a step, I mean, if a child, yeah, that wouldn't, the only way that would apply is
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.300]   if there's like a legal adoption.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.900]   Step-parent is not considered a parent.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:40.140]   A step-like sibling wouldn't be considered a legal sibling unless there was an adoption.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:51.100]   So a stepson would not have legal entitlement the way a blood son would, or daughter, but
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.820]   adoption makes them the equivalent of a blood relative?
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.820]   Yes.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.820]   Okay.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.820]   Yes.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.820]   Great clarification.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:03.460]   And then contesting a will in part versus in full.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.460]   Right.
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:09.140]   I mean, it's not only the will that a contestant can object to.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:13.100]   They can also object to the appointment of the executor.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:19.580]   So yes, in theory, a disgruntled family member could say, I'm contesting the part of the
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.940]   will that appoints this person as executor.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:31.980]   And in my mind, that's not necessarily attacking the will in that the contest could say, well,
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:40.300]   now the person has a drug problem, so they're not drug or alcohol or substance abuse.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:46.060]   So they're not, because of that, what's become a disability, they're not qualified to serve
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.060]   as executor.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.780]   It's not that there's anything wrong with the will per se, it's just this person can't
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.780]   do that.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:59.540]   The only other thing I'm aware of along those lines, like a partial contest of a will is
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.500]   if you say a certain beneficiary shouldn't inherit or legally can inherit because they
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:10.620]   committed some kind of a crime, like you do have situations where a spouse will kill another
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:20.420]   spouse and you're not allowed to benefit from an intentional wrong act or murder like that.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.540]   So that comes into play in that sense, too.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:33.180]   But I've never seen or heard of a will contest where someone comes in and says, we're attacking,
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:39.340]   we want to knock out these gifts here, but allow the other gifts in the will.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:44.260]   It's either the person had capacity and the will was valid or it's not.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.260]   Okay.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.220]   So closer to an all or nothing situation.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.220]   Okay.
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:53.180]   And then can you walk us through probate, high level, and then just heads up for other
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.140]   folks, I see we're 10 to the hour.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:02.380]   Summerfield and I will try to wrap by nine Eastern and turn it over to the chat questions.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:09.300]   So Summerfield following your probate response, let's transition to trust one on one.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.780]   What is a trust, et cetera, but after probate.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.780]   Sure.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.780]   Sure.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:20.580]   So for probate, okay, you have your original will and touching on issues you raised earlier
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.700]   about copies.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.940]   You only want to have one original will.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:30.300]   If you have duplicate original wills, you have to produce all of them.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.680]   If you can't produce all of them, the will is dead.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.680]   It's out.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:40.700]   And that's part of the affidavit, the self-proving affidavit that the will witnesses have to
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:47.260]   sign for probate to go through is their statement that there was only one original will sign.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.980]   So you want to, you have to produce that original will, you have to produce a death certificate
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.140]   for the court.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.140]   You have to-
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:04.020]   So really quick, is it preferable, so is it best to have only one original?
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:08.980]   Let's say the person wants one in a safety deposit box, one with the spouse, one with
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.700]   the executor, is that ill-advised?
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.820]   Yes, definitely.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:20.100]   Because again, if something happens to one of those originals, whether it's lost or maybe
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:26.180]   someone puts a line through the fifth page of one of those originals, that can knock
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.260]   out the whole shebang.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:34.460]   So you really don't, that's, yeah, highly recommend against that.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:42.220]   That being said, when I'm having a testator sign his or her original will, I always do
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:49.140]   a conformed copy of the will, which is basically a duplicate that the attorney fills out that
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:56.060]   can be used as a substitute in case something happens to that original will, lost or destroyed.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.100]   Court has provisions for accepting that.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:02.460]   There's nothing wrong with making photocopies of wills and sharing with the family and all
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.460]   that.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:08.260]   But yeah, it's recommended not to have more than one original will.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:12.440]   Would you recommend generally speaking, I know situations vary, that the will be shared
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.020]   with beneficiaries in advance?
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:21.760]   That's really up to the family or the person doing their will.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.340]   I'm not sure it matters that much.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:33.460]   I mean, in terms of avoiding will contests and avoiding family angst and upset, to the
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:39.680]   extent that you can treat everyone the same, you know, and just try to promote peace, you
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.220]   know, that's the idea.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:46.940]   I mean, obviously that can't be done every single time, but you want to try to do your
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:54.380]   will and share or don't share the will with the family, with the mind towards promoting
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:59.420]   people working together and continuity and peace once you're gone.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:04.100]   Because if you start springing things on people, that's just a recipe for legal battles.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.100]   Understood.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.100]   All right.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.860]   I'm going to try to accelerate this because time is going super quick.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:15.300]   So any other key points for probate, what the process means, what it accomplishes, how
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.420]   to have it go as smoothly as possible?
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:18.420]   Right.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:27.500]   It's basically the court looking at the will, the witnesses affidavit, the death certificate,
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:33.140]   just the general picture of the estate and just satisfying itself that there was no kind
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:38.620]   of fraud, that no one took advantage of the testator such that his or her wishes are not
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:43.860]   going to be honored and, you know, making sure the right person's appointed executor
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:47.020]   and just kind of loose supervision over the estate.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.020]   Okay.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:51.380]   Are there situations where you want to avoid probate?
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.700]   What are the risks and benefits?
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.700]   Right.
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:49:03.420]   For one situation, the situation we addressed earlier in terms of if you have a family member
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:12.660]   whose whereabouts you don't know or they're disaffected, in that kind of situation, to
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:21.860]   avoid a lengthy due diligence search, potentially to avoid a will contest, it makes sense to
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:29.700]   think about doing a trust or having all your big assets be with designated beneficiaries
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:36.980]   so you don't have a lot of money being held up in a lengthy estate probate process.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:41.800]   And in terms of paying for these things, it's one thing to inherit as a beneficiary.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:50.180]   Have you seen folks who write, you know, the person whose will it is, are they setting
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.860]   aside money for all these expenses?
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:54.860]   Is that advisable?
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.860]   Does that make it easier?
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.820]   Well, not per se.
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:06.460]   I mean, you have to be a person doing their will wants to or should be attuned to their
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:13.220]   benefit to their beneficiary designations to the extent that they you want to be able
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:19.400]   to if you're planning for an estate to be up and running and you have specific gifts,
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.220]   you only want to have done in your will, then you need to make sure that you're not giving
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:30.000]   every single asset to your daughter by beneficiary designations.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.620]   You want to leave some money that's just going to come into your estate for that purpose,
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:40.540]   for the purpose of making those specific gifts and for having a sum on hand to pay the executor
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.780]   and last expenses.
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.780]   Got it.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   All right.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:44.780]   Sound advice.
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:49.560]   So let's transition to what is a trust high level?
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.800]   When is it most needed?
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:55.480]   When is it not needed?
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:56.600]   What are the different?
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.960]   What are the main what are the most common trust folks should be thinking about and learning
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.960]   about?
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:02.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.920]   Trust just to give a brief explanation.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:20.340]   Trust is a legal document relationship where property is legal title is held with the trustee.
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:26.580]   The trustee has possession of the financial assets, but they're not for the benefit of
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.580]   the trustee.
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:34.300]   They're for the benefit of a third party where it could even be partially for the benefit
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.540]   of the trustee, but also for other people.
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:42.600]   So there's what's called a fiduciary relationship where the trustee, the person holding the
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:48.000]   property is not just free to do whatever they want because it's their money.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:57.860]   They have a legal obligation to use the money, apply the money as directed by the trust to
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:04.120]   the extent the trust sets that forth and for the best interests of the beneficiaries.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:10.780]   And so these kind of relationships, the trust relationships, typically where you see this
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:18.460]   is for for children, you know, for parents leaving money in their will or grandparents
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:27.520]   for children, people under 18 or for disabled people, you know, people who are at some kind
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.880]   of disadvantage such that, you know, if you just handed a 10 year old a hundred thousand
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:39.060]   dollars, you know, that that's a recipe for for disaster, much the same if you handed
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:45.660]   a person with severe physical or mental disabilities, that kind of money, you know, it's fraught
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:47.100]   with peril.
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:55.540]   And the whole aspect, too, of if you're receiving government benefits as a person with a disability
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:53:02.380]   and inherit straight inheritance can be those assets can be seized by the government for
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:08.500]   reimbursement for the government benefits or they can disqualify a person from receiving
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.340]   public assistance.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:15.980]   So in that kind of scenario, it's beneficial often to set up some kind of a trust where
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:23.480]   assets can be applied to help the child, the disabled person, but you don't face the perils
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.780]   of just turning the money over to those individuals.
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.780]   OK, super helpful.
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:36.540]   So for folks, broadly speaking, what situations do you think?
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:41.460]   Have you seen that a trust was overlooked but would have been hugely advantageous?
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:48.020]   Oh, well, actually, I can I can think of an estate that I'm working on right now.
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:56.000]   And I had actually recommended that this person, the testator, do a trust.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.120]   But and the person was right, the person declined because they said it would have been a lot
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.920]   of work for the person.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:07.240]   And they were in terms of retitling all their assets, because it's not a matter of just
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.620]   signing a trust document and boom, that's it.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:16.940]   To do a real trust that's going to bypass probate, you have to retitle all your assets
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.180]   in the name of the trust.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:26.360]   But in this scenario, this this testator, she had a family situation where she basically
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:30.800]   had no family or none that she knew about.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:38.740]   And so we had her had her do, you know, affidavits of her family tree, get documents together
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:43.480]   to try to help for the due diligence search that was to come.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:47.940]   But lo and behold, when she passed away.
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:53.320]   I had to start the due diligence and try to find family members.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.500]   And it reached a point, you know, I'm not an expert genealogist or anything.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.440]   So there's only so far I could go.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:03.700]   And ultimately, we had to the executor had to pay for his ancestry dot com.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.300]   They have a service where they will do thorough searches.
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:12.020]   So and it's not the end of the world, but it is time and it is money.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:17.740]   And if this individual had done a trust and gone through the then laborious steps of retitling
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:24.500]   her assets into the trust, her estate process would have been much, much smoother and quicker.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.360]   Okay, that helps.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:33.700]   So in closing, as we're hitting nine Eastern, can you do high level power of attorney?
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.580]   What does it mean?
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.900]   What's the life of it?
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:42.060]   What terminates a power of attorney or different options to terminate it?
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.060]   Why is it important?
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:44.740]   What it allows what it doesn't?
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:50.620]   And then my last question, as broadly as it could help the audience, what do you think
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:56.460]   people are least aware of that they should be more aware of in this under this estate
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.460]   planning umbrella?
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.980]   Why don't we start with power of attorney?
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.220]   Okay, sure.
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.620]   Power of attorney, well, there's two kinds.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:10.820]   The general kind that most people think of when they hear power of attorney is what's
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:15.720]   called a durable power of attorney, which means it survives incapacity.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.980]   And that's what most people want and really should have.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:25.260]   Because it basically says, you know, you're you've appointed someone a trusted family
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:34.900]   member or friend to step into your shoes to basically do anything that you could do for
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.260]   situations where you lack capacity.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:46.140]   And so you want the document to hold up, you know, should you have some kind of accident
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.300]   or illness where you can't handle your financial affairs?
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.340]   That's a durable power of attorney.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:56.460]   There are non durable power of attorneys, which are more limited and specific.
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:02.580]   Like let's say you are going to purchase a home, and you're about to the closing is a
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:09.420]   week away, but you're you're called off on business, or you have a family tragedy, you
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:15.900]   can't make the closing, then what you can do, you can sign a non durable power of attorney,
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.740]   which won't survive your incapacity.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:25.320]   But it appoints a your attorney or your friend, your cousin, to be able to go to the closing
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:30.360]   in a week's time and sign the documents necessary to close on the purchase of your home.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.940]   So that's a non durable power of attorney.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:37.980]   But for our purposes of state planning, you want most people, it's important to have a
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:40.420]   durable power of attorney.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.140]   Because if you don't, and God forbid something happens to you where you're not able to pay
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:52.820]   your bills, sign documents, handle your affairs, then chances are, you're going to have to
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.380]   have a legal guardian appointed to do that.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:59.980]   Because there's no if you're disabled, to the extent that you can't then make out your
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:05.880]   power of attorney, there's no way for anyone to get legal authority to act on your behalf
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:11.420]   absent a court proceeding, which is time and money and invasion of privacy.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.820]   So so power of attorney is important that way.
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.220]   Okay, very helpful.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.220]   Thanks.
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:22.100]   And so then as in closing for this portion of tonight's, and then we'll, we'll go to
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:26.140]   the audience for both pre submitted questions integrated with the chat.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:32.500]   What do you think is so often overlooked that folks should really be more aware of?
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.220]   Yeah, I'll say I'll say three things.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:40.860]   And one of them I mentioned before, and that's the thing about knowing who your closest blood
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.660]   can is.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:47.700]   Because so many people, when I asked them for their closest blood can they'll say, well,
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:52.100]   I'm not leaving this person anything in my will, what does this person have to?
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.100]   Why did they?
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.100]   Why did they even come up?
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.580]   You know, I haven't seen them in 20 years.
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:01.780]   But unfortunately, the fact is, that the court is going to require that that person be a
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:06.580]   part of the process at least get notice, and your will is not going to be probated until
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:12.700]   that person is found, and either signs a waiver or is cited and and you know, doesn't file
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:13.940]   objections.
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:19.500]   So having your family tree squared away, that that's something that's often overlooked and
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.180]   is important.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:29.340]   The other two things for a trust, some, let's say you want to do a living trust to avoid
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:36.260]   probate because you have a family situation or something where probate is problematic.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:44.020]   A lot of people feel incorrectly that if they sign their living trust document, that's it,
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:46.020]   they're complete with their job.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:51.140]   When in fact, for that living trust document to be operative, you have to retitle your
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:55.780]   assets in the name of that trust, you have to go to your bank, you have to go to Vanguard,
[00:59:55.780 --> 01:00:01.940]   you have to go to your life insurance, whatever and put the asset in the trust name, or else
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.300]   the asset won't be administered by the trust.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.860]   And the only way you're going to administer that asset, have it go to who you want it
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:16.020]   to go to, is for a probate of your will, which you ostensibly are trying to avoid.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:23.100]   The third thing, mistake I see sometimes, is for powers of attorney.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:30.940]   People will sign their power of attorney, but then their agent, that person needs to
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.140]   sign the power of attorney as well.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:38.660]   And ideally, they'll sign it within a week or so of the principal signing it.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:43.700]   And sometimes I will give the power of attorney to the person that's just signed it and they
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.660]   say, "Okay, I'm going to have my daughter sign it or my husband sign it, and then I'll
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:51.060]   get it back to you and we'll be all set."
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.140]   And then something happens, they don't follow through.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:59.460]   And unfortunately, at that point, the power of attorney can just be invalid.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.240]   Because if the longer-
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.540]   Can you clarify, you use the term agent and you said the daughter or the, are these the
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:09.420]   intended power of attorney person or?
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.420]   Correct.
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:17.060]   Like, let's say a mother appoints her daughter as her agent on her power of attorney, and
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:21.700]   the mother signs the power of attorney, giving the daughter the authority.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:26.300]   But for the New York State power of attorney form, the daughter has to sign the form as
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:33.340]   well, and banks and financial institutions, they want the daughter to have signed on as
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:38.820]   agent within, say, a week of her mother signing on.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:44.140]   If much more time goes by, often they will balk at honoring the power of attorney because
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:47.700]   they'll say, "Why is there this big time lag?
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:48.700]   Something's wrong."
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:56.500]   And is it simply the date that the signer dates?
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.900]   Because they could post, they could put an earlier date, right?
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:01.740]   Well, it has to be notarized.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:02.740]   Okay.
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.740]   That answers it.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.820]   With that, I know we have many questions from the audience.
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.660]   I'm over time.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.660]   Thank you so much, Summer.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:18.140]   One of the questions that came in on the RSVP, many of them involved spendthrift trusts,
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:27.220]   and also just the difference between a trust and a will, and also special needs trusts.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:32.500]   And first, on the difference between a trust and a will, Summerfield, is it correct that
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:40.220]   one of the main differences is that a will is public record, and a trust is private?
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:47.340]   So for example, if you are somebody important, I've heard that Robin Williams kept everything
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.720]   in trust.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.860]   Nobody knows anything about his, very little about the passing of his estate, because it
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:03:00.820]   was all in trust, whereas we know other people have not done that, and they are in wills
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.700]   and they are public record.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:09.840]   So that would seem to me to be one consideration in going a trust versus a will.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:15.940]   And then another one that I heard is that a trust moves along quicker.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:25.020]   If you want your beneficiaries to have their, what you've left for them, smoothly and quickly,
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:29.900]   you put it in a trust, a living trust, or a revocable trust, just to get it there right
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:30.900]   away.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:38.140]   The trustee just hands it over, whereas a will, most of these, everything is distributed
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.460]   towards the end of the will.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.060]   It takes a while for the will to progress through the system.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:49.060]   And it could take months and months for the beneficiaries to get there, what they have
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:52.380]   been given.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.380]   Have you found that to be true?
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.380]   That is true.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.380]   That is true.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:04.900]   And yes, because the will has to be probated, approved by the court, and that takes time.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:11.420]   And then even after that, once the executor is appointed, in New York, there's a statutory
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:18.460]   period of seven months over which creditors have the right to submit claims on the estate.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:24.740]   And so while the executor technically, right when he or she is appointed, can make distributions
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:33.860]   to beneficiaries, it's generally unwise to do that because if expenses come in, if claims
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:43.340]   come in, and the executor is given out money such that he or she can't meet the burden
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:49.100]   of the expenses that come into the estate, then he or she is personally liable to the
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:55.320]   extent that he gave that money out, liable on those legitimate claims.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:01.820]   So as a practical matter, executors typically wait the seven-month period, even after they've
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:06.620]   gone through probate, before they'll make the beneficiary designations.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.020]   And trusts are quicker.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:18.460]   Now it's a little bit of a catch-22 in that you're going to have to go through some paperwork
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:22.780]   and hassles with either a living trust or a will.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.280]   Unfortunately, it's kind of unavoidable.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:33.480]   The good thing about a trust is that you handle the hassles ahead of time.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.400]   You deal with your own financial institutions and banks.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.240]   You show them the trust document.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:49.680]   It's not like a traumatic experience or anything, but the financial institutions, this isn't
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.320]   a top priority for them.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.320]   They're not getting new money or new customers.
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:58.440]   They're just having to do bureaucratic change of ownership forms.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.920]   So they're not particularly motivated to be helpful or quick.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.120]   So it is a little bit of a frustrating process.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:11.360]   But if you go through it and you complete it, then the benefit is, yes, when you pass
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.360]   away, you don't have to go to the court.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.240]   You don't have to deal with probate.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:23.280]   The assets will transfer by trust when you go to the financial institution and show them
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280]   the death certificate.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.320]   I mean, you have to fill out some forms, but it's a much smoother, easier process than
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.760]   the probate process.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:39.840]   And also another thing, a trust can provide for periodic distributions to a beneficiary,
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:45.280]   for example, children, elderly people, and even if, and this gets into some of the other
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:55.800]   questions on the RSVP, about leaving funds, leaving your estate to children who may burn
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.280]   through their money very quickly.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:03.760]   If you leave it in a trust, it's true, isn't it, that you can distribute it over time,
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.080]   whereas in a will, can you do that?
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.120]   Well, yes and no.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.760]   And that's a good, you're bringing up an excellent point.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:20.200]   And because we've, so far we've looked at trusts and wills as two separate things and
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:27.000]   not being intermingled and not working together, when in fact they can and do work together
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:35.400]   oftentimes, and in this sense that oftentimes in a will, people will set up a trust and
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400]   a will.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.040]   So it's not a living trust where you've gone through all the rigmarole before you pass
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.880]   away of retitling your assets into the name of the living trust.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:51.680]   Rather in planning your will, you've written the trust into your will.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:08:00.160]   And like with the example with children, you can say in your will, if I pass away before,
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:05.800]   you know, while my child is a minor, then my gift to my child doesn't go directly to
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.640]   him or her, it goes in trust.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:15.440]   And yes, and I direct that one third of the trust be distributed to my child when she's
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:22.120]   25, the second third gets distributed to her when she's 30, and the final third gets distributed
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.800]   to her when she's 35.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:28.520]   You can set that up exactly how you want.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:32.680]   But then that's a trust in a will, not a living trust, but a trust in a will.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:39.280]   And those actually are, you know, are fairly, fairly common, generally, a little more common
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.920]   than the living wills.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920]   So,
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:47.240]   Well, before the next question, I want to just mention that I did read somewhere, there
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.440]   are only two things we should never do ourself.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.600]   The first is anything electrical.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.440]   And the second is prepare our own will.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:07.880]   But I don't know about the second one so much because Vogel heads are pretty, they're very
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   detail oriented.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   Right.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.200]   The other question had to do with spendthrift trust, we had two questions on spendthrift
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.200]   trust.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.760]   What is a spendthrift trust?
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:25.320]   Well, spendthrift trust is basically a provision or a type of trust where you're saying that
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:35.380]   the assets in the trust cannot go to creditors of the beneficiary, or cannot go to reimburse,
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:41.080]   say the government for public assistance that may have gone to the beneficiaries.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:52.600]   So it's basically seeking to streamline the funds in the trust to go directly to the beneficiary
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:58.880]   for the beneficiaries enjoyment or be applied for the beneficiary for education, support,
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.640]   maintenance, something like that, just to prevent some kind of leakage where a creditor
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:11.360]   or spouse or someone can get at those funds.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.120]   And that's a benefit of that kind of a trust.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.980]   As opposed to if you simply handed the money over via a will or via a gift, if you give
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:28.160]   it unfettered to a person, then yes, if they get sued, if they have creditors, if they
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:36.320]   get divorced, if they apply for public benefits, their assets are subject to being lost.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:43.680]   And it is a catch 22 though, because you do see situations where trust for people are
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:49.780]   helpful for the beneficiaries, but you also see situations where beneficiaries are resentful
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.440]   that they aren't simply left the money.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.080]   Sometimes they feel slighted, like what you don't trust me to manage my own money.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.060]   Like I'm not an adult, I can't handle things.
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:04.440]   Sometimes they can feel resentful of the trustee.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:10.440]   The person can say, I have needs, I need to buy a car, I have a health issue.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.000]   And the trustee is being stingy with me.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.620]   They're not releasing the funds for my wishes or my needs.
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:26.540]   So it cuts both ways, but obviously you have to evaluate your own situation and make the
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:27.940]   best decision you can.
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:28.940]   Thank you.
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:29.940]   Okay.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.960]   Carol, do we have any questions from the chat?
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:40.020]   Yes, we do have one that is in Florida, but I do believe it should have some general applicability.
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:43.780]   First of all, are you aware of any special treatment of a primary residence in Florida
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:46.420]   regarding it, allowing it to avoid probing?
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:51.160]   And if so, assuming you have beneficiary designations on all of your other assets, so you don't
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.940]   otherwise need to go through probate, how would you direct who your house goes to?
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:58.280]   Would you use a lady bird deed?
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.380]   And just for this question, there is no wife or children.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.380]   If I were a Florida attorney, hopefully I could answer that.
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:11.240]   But unfortunately, in New York, we don't have those kinds of things.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:15.020]   So I really, unfortunately, I'm not able to answer that.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.020]   Okay.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.020]   Thanks anyway.
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:18.020]   Sure.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.020]   Sure.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:20.020]   Oh, Alice.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:28.180]   So we have a question from Steve.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:33.680]   What are your thoughts on checking and verifying a will with chat, chat, GPT, or other similar
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.680]   programs?
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:41.980]   To be honest, I'm unfamiliar with with those programs.
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:45.660]   I mean, I know about the wheel kits and those kind of things.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:49.180]   Um, yeah, I don't.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.940]   Yeah, I guess, yeah, I really, again, I have to plead ignorance.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:13:00.100]   I mean, to the extent I mentioned earlier that I think that, to the extent you can keep
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:06.940]   things simpler, and maybe a simpler program or just following the will of an attorney
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:13.500]   is done for a family member, I personally would recommend that a little more than trusting
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:24.860]   yourself or specific programs that because the will of your grandfather that you have,
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:30.780]   I think the odds are pretty high that that's gone through probate, and, and held up to
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:37.580]   the court review, whereas something that comes from the computer, you know, probably hasn't
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.660]   hasn't had that vetting.
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.660]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.220]   Um, thank you.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:50.300]   The question regarding the Lady Bird deed in Florida, we can push that question, perhaps
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.820]   towards the end of the meeting.
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:59.300]   And because there are Florida, there are Florida people here, and we do know a little bit about
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.140]   the Lady Bird deeds.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.140]   Okay.
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.860]   Um, let me see.
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:12.700]   And by the way, the states that have Lady Bird deeds are Florida, Texas, Michigan, West
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.100]   Virginia, and Vermont.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:21.020]   And a Lady Bird deed can be in other states.
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:26.060]   But it's called an enhanced life estate deed.
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:27.060]   It's not a trust.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.060]   It's a deed.
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:32.780]   But why don't we put that question at the end of the meeting, so that we can discuss
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:33.780]   the other questions.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:38.420]   Now, let me see, Lucas, are there any other chat questions?
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.940]   Yeah, yeah, there's a few more.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.940]   Um, thanks.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.940]   Thanks, Summerfield.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.940]   Thanks for this insightful discussion.
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:54.100]   Um, so one, uh, one question was, if a will is created in one state, and you have moved
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:58.860]   to another state, is a new will suggested or required?
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:07.980]   Um, what I recommend to people is I say, take your will that we've done in New York and
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:14.220]   show it to your attorney in Michigan, or a new attorney in Michigan and ask that individual.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:21.860]   Because the state laws are generally similar in terms of the requirements for, you know,
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.300]   witnesses and all that and a will.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:34.300]   But like, my main concern with that is, I could see where, say, in Michigan, the specific
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:43.340]   statute setting forth what the witness affidavits have to recite, it could be slightly different.
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:49.980]   So that while the will that we did in New York is still valid, the Michigan court, when
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:56.900]   the person passes away, may want their specific will witness affidavits to be signed by the
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.900]   witnesses we had in New York.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:05.320]   And in 20 or 30 years, for the people in Michigan to try and locate these New York witnesses
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.980]   and get them to re-sign affidavits, that's, that's enough of a challenge where in that
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:15.700]   situation, I would recommend, and I imagine the Michigan attorney would recommend, let's
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.940]   just do a new will here in Michigan.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:26.660]   But the short answer is, take it to an attorney in the new state to be best guided.
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:27.660]   Great.
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:28.660]   Great.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.660]   Thank you.
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:30.660]   Sure.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:33.140]   Carol, any more questions from the chat?
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.140]   Yes.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:38.140]   Would there be a circumstance under which it would be a good idea to videotape the signing
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:42.340]   of the will to demonstrate sound mind and intent?
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.340]   Yes.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:48.260]   And, and I've, I've never done this and I've never been involved in a case where it has
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.660]   been done, but, but I have read literature.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:56.020]   There are attorneys who say, and it makes sense that in certain situations you would
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:01.860]   want to videotape, you know, if a person has some kind of illness or disability, or they're
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:07.820]   really quite old or something, and you sense that there could be a challenge, then it makes
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:13.020]   sense that a videotape could be very valuable.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:17.020]   But I've also read and heard where it could backfire as well.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:22.540]   I mean, you could have a person who really has capacity, but they could look somewhat
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.540]   frail and fragile.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:28.860]   And just that appearance could raise an inference that they don't have capacity.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:37.300]   So the answer is yes, but I think you need to be a little bit careful with that, so.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.300]   Thank you.
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.300]   Alice.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.620]   Question from Jim.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:48.660]   Can a will be modified by strikeouts, initials, et cetera, or do you have to redraft the company
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.380]   will?
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:56.460]   Well, it can be modified at the time of the will signing.
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:03.900]   Like, I mean, it happens with some frequency that, like a will I've prepared, maybe I've
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:11.340]   made a typo, or a person's address has changed, or the testator themselves, they'll want to
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:13.980]   make a change sort of at the last minute.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:19.540]   And so it is fine at that point, when you're having the person sign their will, to do a
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:27.460]   line through that kind of thing, and you have the witness's initial and all that.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:30.180]   As a practical matter, that's not-- well, it's not a big deal.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:34.900]   The courts down the road, when you go to probate the will, they will want an affidavit just
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:40.940]   about that little change, which is not a big deal, but something to keep in mind.
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:46.420]   Where you can't do a cross out is after the will has been signed and witnessed.
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:50.620]   Like if the testator takes the will home, and a week or three years later, they want
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:55.660]   to make a small adjustment, doing a line through, that can invalidate the entire will.
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:19:01.380]   So you'd want to go back to the attorney and redo it.
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:06.700]   How would one know, Summerfield, whether it was done for your post?
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.860]   That's an excellent point.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:15.020]   I suppose you'd have to look at the documents.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:24.020]   If I've had a typo, or the testator's changed something at the last minute, I think whether
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:32.820]   I have the will initialed, and then-- I was going to say I put the date on, but I don't
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:35.180]   think we've done that.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:43.700]   I think you just have to look at the totality of the-- probably looking at the-- because
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:47.060]   the change should be initialed by the witnesses.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:51.660]   And you've got the-- if the handwriting for the initials doesn't match the handwriting
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:57.620]   of the witnesses at the end of the will, then that's a red flag that the testator or someone
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:01.060]   has done that themselves.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.060]   So--
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.060]   That makes sense.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:07.180]   The strikeout would be initialed, and perhaps dated, at the time of the signing.
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.180]   Right.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.180]   OK.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:14.220]   We have another question from the RSVP.
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:20.580]   And this says, how do you handle firearms in an estate?
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:27.460]   None are NFA items, those requiring the ATF approval and tax stamp.
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:30.940]   There is a mix of firearms.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:34.980]   Most go to the son and the rest to the wife.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:38.940]   Do I place them in a trust or in a will?
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:47.340]   And I read years ago not to list individual serial numbers in a will.
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:48.420]   Right.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:21:03.460]   My recommendation for that would be that you say in your will, I leave my personal property
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:10.500]   or my household effects or items in my home, items in my garage, I leave them to my executor
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:17.100]   to distribute as I have made known to him or her in a separate writing.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.900]   So you're not actually mentioning, you're not putting down in your will that you have
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:23.460]   firearms.
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:27.740]   That's something that people do a lot of times for jewelry and that kind of thing.
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:31.460]   Because again, like we mentioned earlier, wills are a public record.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:40.620]   And I think to the extent that you can not reveal every specific property that you own,
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.500]   I think that's probably better.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:51.580]   Now, just so you know, like in New York State, within nine months of being appointed as executor,
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:55.860]   an executor or the attorney for the estate is required to submit an inventory to the
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.740]   court.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:03.200]   And that inventory, one of the questions asks about firearms.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.860]   And if there are firearms, you have to indicate that there are in the estate.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:12.140]   And then there's a separate page you have to submit about the type and all that sort
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.380]   of thing.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:18.740]   So in some cases, it's unavoidable.
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:25.380]   I mean, if you could leave the firearms, gift them prior to passing away, I mean, that's
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.860]   one option.
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:33.300]   A trust could be an option, but I'm not sure that that would actually work.
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:39.900]   I guess you'd have to check with the licensing authority in the state.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:47.300]   And if the licensing authority will allow a trust, like if you can register the trust
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.940]   as the owner of a weapon, then that's fine.
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:57.380]   The trust can hold the title to the guns and that would pass separately from your estate.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:02.520]   But I'm a little bit doubtful that the gun licensing authorities in the state are going
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:07.980]   to allow a trust as opposed to an individual to be the registered owner, because then the
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.940]   background checks and all that.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:12.260]   But that's something you could look into.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:18.380]   Summerfield, are there other things that you should not put into a will?
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:26.300]   For example, in the chat, they talked about funeral arrangements, organ donations.
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:30.580]   What I understand is that if you put those in the will, usually you're going to be long
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:35.580]   gone and buried before will is even found, perhaps.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:36.580]   Exactly.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:42.660]   I mean, it's not so much, I mean, putting it in the will, that's, I mean, that's, yeah,
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.860]   it's not going to help, but it's not the end of the world.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:49.700]   The problem is if you rely, if you haven't done it elsewhere, if you're relying on the
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:55.580]   will to, for the organ donation and for the funeral, handling the funeral, yeah, it's
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.220]   going to, it's going to take too long.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:01.580]   You should, you know, have it in a separate letter to your executor about your, or your
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:05.180]   family, about your funeral arrangements and last service.
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:10.220]   And you should have on your driver's license or on something with your doctor, you know,
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:14.900]   the, the organ donation form, you know, have that done before.
[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:19.020]   If you want to put it in your will also, that's fine, but don't rely on the will because like
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.740]   you say, it's going to be too late.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:25.340]   Lucas, any more chat questions?
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:29.500]   Yeah, let's see.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:34.980]   One of them was, you know, what are the pros and cons of designating beneficiaries in a
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:36.940]   brokerage account?
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:42.900]   For example, like a TOD designation versus designating beneficiaries specifically in
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.900]   a will?
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.500]   Well, the pro, I think we've talked some about the pros.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:55.300]   The pros are that the money is, if you designate someone on your account, as opposed to in
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:03.700]   your will, the money is 99% of the time going to go to the beneficiary much quicker because
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:08.420]   you just have to show a death certificate to the financial institution.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:14.340]   You don't have to wait for the probate process, the estate process to go through.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:23.380]   I mean, I suppose there, you know, strange circumstances where it could be a negative,
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:30.060]   like I remember I had one case, I think, where someone had left a beneficiary designation
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:34.820]   on their bank account to a family member, but they spelled the person's name wrong and
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:41.460]   the bank was very difficult about turning over the funds because the name didn't match
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:42.780]   exactly.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:47.900]   And in theory, if you did that by will, probably you wouldn't have, the court wouldn't give
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.180]   you such a difficult time.
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:26:00.060]   I mean, another sort of, just to play devil's advocate, you could leave beneficiary designations
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:04.980]   in your accounts and then forget about them.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:09.780]   And then when you go to set up your will, you could have your whole estate plan put
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:14.820]   forth in your will, and the fact that you've done the beneficiary designation is going
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:18.740]   to throw off what you plan for in your will.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:23.500]   So, but if you integrate, if you know all your assets and your beneficiary designations
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:26.020]   in your will, you're going to avoid that pitfall.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:27.020]   So.
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.020]   Okay.
[01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:29.020]   Thank you.
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:33.020]   Bob, I'd like to open it up for raised hand questions.
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:39.820]   Do any of the, does anybody have a question they would like to raise their hand and ask?
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:45.540]   1, 2, 4, 8.
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:48.700]   You're mute.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:52.820]   Hi, 1, 2, 4, 8.
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:53.820]   Are you ready?
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:54.820]   Yes, I am.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:55.820]   Hi.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:56.820]   Hi.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:03.300]   I have a question that I, I had a question that I submitted via RSVP, it applies to at
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:09.940]   least nine states of the union and in parts, five or six others, and that deals with the
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:17.980]   difference between estate documents drafted in a state that does not have community property
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:23.740]   laws versus then moving into the state that does.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:29.780]   So that was my question, and I wonder if Summerfield has anything to comment about things to watch
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:32.060]   out for in that instance.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.060]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:38.820]   I really, unfortunately, I really can't say much to that because I've only practiced in
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.340]   New York, you know, which is not a community property state.
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:47.140]   I haven't had, I mean, I've had some experience with people who leave the state and come into
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:52.340]   the state, but I've never been involved in the community property issue.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:58.260]   I think the only, my only advice would be if you do change states to speak to an attorney
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:05.220]   in the state in which your new state, just to try to figure, yeah, figure all this out.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:10.620]   And Summerfield, for folks not familiar, can you clarify what it means to be a community
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.780]   property state?
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:21.180]   Community property, if I remember my history, I think the, well, there's part, I think,
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:29.900]   with just laws in terms of divorce and spousal property, I think that's different.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:34.820]   And it may even be tied in, and you guys may know this better than I do, some of you, but
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:42.860]   I think that, you know, when we set up our legal system in America, most of the legal
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:48.620]   system was modeled, most of the states modeled things on the old English system, the common
[01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:52.180]   law in England, and statutes and all.
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:57.420]   But the influence of the French and Napoleon, like Louisiana was in the Napoleonic code.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:05.300]   And so that was a whole different, you know, just legal history background precedent.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:09.100]   So I think that that's where that comes in.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:16.980]   The community property states are, they're out west usually, Alaska, Arizona, California,
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:34.180]   Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington State, also Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Louisiana
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.660]   is its own thing.
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:51.940]   Yeah, I mean, generally, I think states are, look to do the similar, you know, very similar
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:52.940]   type thing.
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:58.500]   I mean, I'm sure there are differences in terms of rules and regulations, but like with
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:04.660]   spouses being disinherited, it would surprise me greatly that there were certain, if there
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:11.100]   were certain states where you could completely disinherit a spouse, you know, that.
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.620]   For example, Florida is not a community property state.
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:21.940]   But as you mentioned earlier, you cannot disinherit your spouse in your will, you do have to provide
[01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:26.360]   for them, I think it's 30% and for your minor children.
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:33.340]   So it's not a community property state, but it does still, the goal of it is to provide
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:38.820]   for, you know, your family so that they're not out on the streets.
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:39.820]   Sure, sure.
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:47.220]   Yeah, the question didn't arise from an intent to disinherit, it arose from the context of
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:54.740]   just making sure that the estate plan wasn't screwed up by, you know, the new laws in the
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:55.740]   new state.
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:58.780]   So I am an attorney, but I'm not an estate lawyer.
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:02.580]   So since I am an attorney, I'm trying to find out the answer to the question before I ask
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:03.860]   it on the record.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:08.580]   So I thank you, Summerfield, for your advice, but I am going to hire a lawyer, I just kind
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:11.020]   of wanted to know what the answer was before I did.
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.020]   Sure.
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:18.020]   I mean, to me, the thing that always pops into my mind in terms of different states
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:22.220]   is not so much the will per se, but estate taxes.
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:28.620]   Because, you know, some states have an estate tax, and others don't.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:32.740]   And there's always the federal estate tax, but that's at a very high threshold.
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:36.140]   So that doesn't really apply to many people.
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:41.420]   But some states have, yeah, the state taxes that do to apply to a lot of folks.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:42.420]   Right.
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:52.300]   But for example, on ours, we did one thing with a house in our primary, in our former
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:53.300]   state.
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:56.020]   And then now in the community property state, we bought a house.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:59.500]   So it's going to get treated differently in the estate.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:03.340]   So but I have a special needs trust to deal with.
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:07.580]   So I'm well on my way, but I just was looking for your perspective.
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.660]   So thanks for considering the question.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:10.660]   Oh, sure.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:11.660]   Sure.
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:12.660]   And good luck.
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.660]   Good luck.
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:14.660]   Thank you.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:15.660]   Thank you.
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:19.060]   Does anybody else have a raised hand question?
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:26.060]   Miriam, in the absence of other raised hands, I'll, I'll ask two more of Summerfield that
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:32.260]   we ran out of time, which is Summerfield, can you give folks high level summary of healthcare
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:37.180]   proxy and medical directive slash living will?
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.700]   Sure.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:46.020]   Just like the power of attorney was for your financial matters, the healthcare proxy is
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:51.380]   for your healthcare matters, where you're appointing someone to make the decisions that
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:58.020]   you would make if you had capacity, if you could communicate them.
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:05.380]   So I mean, in my experience, doing the financial power of attorney is is more important than
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:07.500]   a healthcare proxy.
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:15.440]   Because if you fall ill and go into a hospital, the doctors are going to speak and take direction
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:21.740]   from your closest blood kin, even without a healthcare proxy.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:27.220]   But if you go to a bank without a financial power of attorney, you're you're you're, yeah,
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:31.820]   the bank's not going to honor the requests of your close family, they're going to insist
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:32.940]   on something in writing.
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:39.300]   So and but and to go along with the healthcare proxy, you can also do a medical directive,
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:44.940]   which is basically your statement of what kind of treatment you'd like to accept or
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:55.500]   refuse at sort of an end of life situation, you know, whether you accept artificial respiration,
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:01.100]   cardiopulmonary resuscitation, you know, all that sort of thing.
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:07.620]   And in New York, at least there, there's no specific statutes that say, as with the power
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:13.560]   of financial power of attorney, that doctors and hospitals have to honor a medical directive.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:19.020]   But in cases that have gone before judges, if someone has a statement in writing that's
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:25.980]   witness that says, I want the plug to be pulled, if I'm in a coma, the writing holds up is
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:32.820]   given more weight by judges than testimony of friends or family saying, Oh, Susan always
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:37.980]   said if she was unconscious, she you know, she wanted the plug pulled.
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:38.980]   So
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:44.540]   Carol, do you have any more Alice from the chat?
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:47.060]   Yeah, there's a couple more.
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.300]   This may have already been covered.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:51.080]   But there are two questions that were basically the same thing.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:55.280]   If all of your assets are passing, you know, directly to beneficiaries via beneficiary
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.040]   designation or transfer on death.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.900]   So there's two parts of this.
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:03.060]   What happens if you don't have any money to pay in this, there's no state to pay those
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.060]   final bills?
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:09.340]   And the other question is, like, should you leave part of your money to make an estate
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:12.220]   just to pay final final bill bills?
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:17.020]   Yeah, that's an excellent question.
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:23.520]   I haven't personally encountered that situation.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:30.620]   I mean, I suppose it's possible that certain Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's possible what you
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:36.980]   know, whether it's taxes, or I don't know, child support or something.
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:45.500]   Or a lawsuit, I suppose it's conceivable that those entities, those creditors could somehow
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:53.260]   reach into assets that are left to D or directly to a beneficiary.
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:55.060]   I could see that happening.
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:36:02.220]   But but that this is just based on hunch as opposed to knowledge.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:05.620]   So ultimately, I don't know, I've never encountered that.
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:11.060]   But I mean, as a practical matter, though, I think it'd be very difficult for any creditor
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:15.700]   to get at those assets if they don't come into an estate, if they've waited till the
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.060]   person dies.
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:22.960]   So as to the second question, should you leave something to pay those final expenses?
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:27.060]   I mean, every situation is different.
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:34.780]   I would probably say, yes, you should do that unless you've made some other kind of arrangement.
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:40.460]   Like if you've made a prepaid funeral, set up a prepaid funeral, unless you've maybe
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:46.740]   asked your if you have life insurance, you've asked your life insurance beneficiary to make
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:52.860]   sure that certain obligations were taken care of out of that life insurance money, you know,
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:59.900]   or maybe, yeah, have a have a joint account with a trusted person so that and have them
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:04.980]   use the the joint account funds to pay off certain expenses.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.980]   So.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:06.980]   Thank you.
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:07.980]   Yes, Steve.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:16.780]   I was just curious if you had any recommended books on this subject.
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:20.340]   It's so complicated and it's kind of hard to get a big picture view.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:26.320]   I almost feel like a flowchart would be super helpful or like this thing supersedes the
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.300]   next thing, supersedes the next thing.
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:33.540]   And like, I don't know, I just write myself like, well, I just found myself like looking
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:37.940]   on Amazon and I found like the top 10 estate planning books, but I was wondering if you
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:38.940]   had any recommendations.
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:39.940]   I don't.
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:42.060]   You know, to be honest, it's it's it's interesting.
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:50.060]   I have never the only book I've read about like a state and estate planning was the book.
[01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:57.180]   Well, I forget it was about the Johnson and Johnson estate contest in the New York County
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:03.920]   Surrogates Court with that that older fellow who married his much younger maid.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.120]   So I and that was more of an entertainment type thing as opposed to the nitty gritty
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.120]   of the state.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.940]   So I honestly I don't have a book recommendation.
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:20.560]   One thing you might consider is, you know, sometimes local libraries or a university
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:31.920]   or even a bar association or and like Schwab or Vanguard, they may have programs where
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:39.160]   they would maybe something like this or something, but where they would have written materials
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.840]   about estate planning, estate process.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.880]   That might be something to to explore.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:47.880]   Thank you.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:53.720]   There is one thing about beneficiaries, Summerfield, and that is and this came up in the chat.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:39:00.680]   Also, the power of attorney, a general power of attorney that that is created and it covers
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.680]   everything.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:06.120]   You know, I mean, we have family members who have powers of attorney that are like twenty
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:11.720]   five pages long and it covers everything, every every aspect of your life, the power
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:16.640]   of attorney, the banks, the this, the that, the doctors, the everything.
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:25.480]   But really, when you go to when you have Vanguard, Chase Bank, Fidelity, Wells Fargo Bank, those
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:32.480]   institutions, the financial institutions want their own power of attorney because it specifically
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:40.800]   addresses what that institution does and they have your money and they have sometimes millions
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:47.360]   of dollars of your money and they want to make sure that the beneficiary, the power
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.200]   of attorney, everything is correct and accurate.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.960]   And so they, for example, at Vanguard, we're at Vanguard.
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:56.960]   We used that.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:04.200]   We made sure that we use their powers of power of attorney, which is called the full agent
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.760]   authority.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:08.400]   And it is a little process to set it up.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.960]   But once you set it up, it's at Vanguard there.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.560]   You don't have to worry about bringing your own and, you know, emailing it to them or
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.560]   faxing it to them.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.560]   And they're just not going.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.560]   They may not accept it.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.240]   First of all, I'm not going to it's just so thick.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.240]   Sure.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.240]   Sure.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:29.000]   And we have on the forum posts where people go to Chase Bank, they go to Wells Fargo Bank
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.440]   with their power of attorney and it's worthless.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.440]   It's not useful.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.440]   Right.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440]   It doesn't work.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440]   Sure.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.440]   Sure.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.440]   Now, I think the banks.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:45.240]   Yeah, I mean, in New York, they recently changed the law where they've made it now where banks
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:51.400]   have to provide a specific reason for why they are rejecting a power of attorney.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:58.440]   And if it turns out that that rejection is unreasonable, then banks can be liable for
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:03.120]   a limited amount of money damages for not honoring a power of attorney.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:08.960]   And I think banks run a little bit of a risk when they when they do that, you know, just
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.940]   automatically reject the power of attorney.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:14.800]   But yeah, nine times out of 10, they're going to get away with it.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:21.400]   So it makes sense to be proactive and try to make sure that you have the power of attorney
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.120]   that the institution is going to honor ahead of time.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.600]   So it makes it easier.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:28.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:33.800]   Any other questions, chat raised hand?
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:36.040]   There's two related questions in the chat.
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:42.320]   One is from Mark saying, do you even need a will if all your assets have beneficiaries?
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:48.120]   And Uzma says, if I only have assets and accounts that have designated beneficiaries, I have
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:54.240]   no property, just an old car, nothing expensive in my home, do I need a trust?
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:58.520]   Will I have to go through probate for these meager assets?
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:05.360]   In terms of the trust, yeah, I would say probably not unless you have one of those scenarios
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:12.280]   where you have someone that you want to benefit who's disabled or if it has to go through
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.280]   the estate.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:19.080]   If you have a situation where someone in your family may contest the will or you don't quite
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:25.880]   know your family tree, that kind of thing, which is going to complicate the probate process.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.240]   And you never have to have a will.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:39.200]   It's just, if you don't have a will, it's harder for your family, the person who's going
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.440]   to be handling your estate to function.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:49.040]   And one example is if you have a will and you submit it to probate, and let's say you
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:56.120]   do have a problem with someone objecting to your will or you don't know where a family
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:01.300]   member is, you have to do a due diligence search and that draws out the process.
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:07.560]   You can still apply for what's called preliminary letters where the court will give you a preliminary
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:13.000]   appointment and allow you to marshal assets.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:21.360]   Let's say the decedent has a portfolio that's in a risky stock and the stock is going down
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:25.140]   and you need to sell that stock before it just bottoms out.
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:32.680]   You can get the preliminary letters, sell the stock before it's plummeted, sell the
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:35.740]   home before it's foreclosed on.
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:43.800]   So having a will in those situations really saves the day, even though you have to wait
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:50.660]   time to ultimately finish the process of turning over the assets to the beneficiaries.
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:58.580]   Flip side, you don't do a will, you still have the assets that are tanking.
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:01.100]   You have a home that's in foreclosure.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:07.300]   If you don't have a will and you submit in your application to be appointed as the estate
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:13.180]   administrator, it's going to take time and the court, because there's no will, they can't
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.340]   give you preliminary letters.
[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:21.700]   They can't give you the advanced authority to sell assets to protect the estate.
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:26.780]   The chances of it happening are not that great, but there are scenarios where if you don't
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:36.900]   have a will, you're kind of stuck just waiting for the court process to go through, and meanwhile,
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:39.760]   the estate can lose value.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:49.260]   So while you don't have to have a will, even if your assets are with beneficiary designations
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:55.500]   or you don't have a lot of assets, I'd recommend getting a will, even if it's a basic simple
[01:44:55.500 --> 01:45:02.020]   will, plus until you die, you never know exactly what's going to be in your estate.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:06.100]   In theory, at the last minute, you could inherit a lot of money.
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:10.900]   You could be a victim of medical malpractice, or you could get hit by a FedEx truck where
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:12.760]   all of a sudden you have a big lawsuit.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:17.340]   You never know at the end of the day how much money could be coming into your estate.
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:21.680]   And money that's from a lawsuit or something or an inheritance, it can't go into the trust
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.820]   you set up.
[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:25.140]   It's going to have to come into your estate.
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:30.180]   So for that, better to just have a basic will in place.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.180]   Thank you.
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.180]   Mark.
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:33.180]   Mark Seipan.
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:39.700]   Mark, you're on mute.
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:43.220]   Hi there.
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:50.340]   I think you just answered a lot of the questions I just had about wills and needing an actual
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:52.740]   trust in addition to the will.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:59.260]   I know that Miriam, we're going to stay on a little after to discuss a primary residence
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:04.260]   in the state of Florida, which is homesteaded, and my understanding, avoids probate.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:10.300]   The question we can discuss later, Miriam, I guess is, is a ladybird even necessary if
[01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:13.580]   you just have a will that designates where the home goes?
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:18.900]   And I know some of you, I know you can't really answer that being in New York, but my general
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:24.820]   question to you is, if you do establish a will, then a trust should be added if you
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:26.500]   feel there's a need for that.
[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:30.340]   You just don't do a trust without a will, is that correct?
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:35.040]   Yeah, that's what, yes, and that's sort of the standard practice that I've seen in New
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:41.060]   York is, yeah, you always, I mean, you, some people do wills and don't do trust, but you
[01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:44.900]   never sort of do a trust and don't do a will.
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:46.900]   Okay.
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:47.900]   Okay.
[01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:48.900]   Thank you so much.
[01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:49.900]   Sure.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:50.900]   What do you say?
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:51.900]   You think we are?
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:55.060]   I actually have, so, Summerfield, this is phenomenal.
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:56.980]   We're very respectful of your time.
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:47:02.420]   If you have a few more minutes, I have two more questions and any closing comments.
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:08.460]   So midnight, midnight Pacific time.
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:14.180]   So one is throughout your comments, I think folks can gather some best practices, but
[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:19.540]   I wanted to see in your, you know, years of experience, if you would elevate certain things
[01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:23.540]   that have been exceptionally helpful in the planning stages.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:30.220]   So one example is a list of accounts, contacts, where things are located, you know, things
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.220]   like that.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:35.580]   So that to me seems probably intuitive, but maybe a lot of people don't get to it.
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:39.100]   So if you have other things like that, that's one.
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:45.940]   And then what would you, what guidance would you offer folks who were procrastinating for
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.740]   whatever reason, started a will, didn't finish it.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:50.060]   They feel overwhelmed.
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:52.500]   They keep putting it off.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:58.500]   What do you say to folks like to simplify the process and have them move further?
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.500]   Right.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:07.020]   Well, one thing that I think helps psychologically with that is to know that you can always change
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:12.980]   your will, and in fact, you probably will change your will at some point, but just to
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:21.740]   have something and particularly, and, you know, like if you have children that are minors,
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:28.260]   just the fact, just, if you just did a will that did nothing, but simply named the guardians,
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:33.940]   that would be incredibly meaningful because like, if you have kids and God forbid you
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:40.840]   and your spouse, assuming you have a spouse, both pass away while the kids are still minors,
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:45.100]   it's basically a free for all as to who's going to raise your children and who's going
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:49.140]   to have control over where they go to school, their medical care and their money.
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:54.460]   I mean, the court would, the court and hopefully your family would try to come to the best
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:49:02.660]   solution, but it's so much better if you can pick, pick the family member or the friend
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:09.160]   that you want to raise your children ahead of time and have that, have that, you know,
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:13.980]   set up and, and of course, and, you know, the next, the day after you sign your will,
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:18.180]   if you feel like you've made a mistake, you just call the attorney and say, you know,
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:19.180]   we need to change it.
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:20.660]   We need to do it differently.
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:26.920]   So maybe thinking a little bit less of all or nothing and more in terms of let's make
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:31.980]   things a little bit better than what they were, I think that can help overcome that,
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:34.500]   that procrastination makes sense.
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:35.780]   Something is better than nothing.
[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:36.780]   Getting it started.
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:45.140]   Uh, finalizing a preliminary version and then making updates whenever you need to.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:46.140]   Yes.
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:50.940]   And also, and it used to be, you know, they used to have codicils and yeah, like my mother
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:57.060]   had an aunt who had like 20 codicils to her will, and she was always leaving people out
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:58.580]   and you know, this kind of thing.
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:01.520]   Can you explain what a codicil is for folks who don't know?
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:09.420]   Codicil is like a brief addendum to a will where you make a, well, I say brief, typically
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:10.420]   they're brief.
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:14.860]   They can be any length, but yeah, typically it's, it's just sort of like an amendment.
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:19.300]   Like people, we were talking earlier about, can you just write in a change to your will,
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:22.300]   hand write it on your will after you've signed your will?
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:28.220]   And the answer is no, but, but so what people have done over the years is they've done codicils,
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:34.980]   which are brief kind of mini wills as addendum to the main will.
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:37.100]   They're out of favor these days.
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:43.820]   And the reason is because if you do a codicil, it's a second will execution ceremony and
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:47.940]   you're republishing the first will as well.
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:54.100]   And so any objectant now to your will, they can attack either the codicil or the will
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:57.480]   itself and the witnesses, the will executions.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:04.020]   So it's giving two, an additional opportunity to try and knock the will out.
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:10.020]   And in the days of word processing, it's so much simpler and easier just to, you know,
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:15.260]   type in the change on your will, print it out and sign again before witnesses, as opposed
[01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:17.620]   to doing the whole codicil business.
[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:22.260]   So it's not, I mean, attorneys will charge for redoing a will, but it's not as much as
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.140]   for the first go round.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:27.980]   So it's not that big a deal to, to update, change your will.
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:28.980]   So.
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:29.980]   Understood.
[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:33.540]   And perhaps you could, you could couple it with a fun event the way you said ceremony.
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:38.920]   Sometimes people have a house painting party, get a bunch of friends, you get a few pizzas,
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:45.620]   you could have a codicil re-signing party or, you know, the new will party.
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:48.620]   Yeah.
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:49.620]   Definitely.
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:51.860]   So let's do one last round of questions.
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:52:01.220]   Alex, Alice, Carol, Lucas, Miriam, any raised hands in the audience before we sign off with
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:02.220]   Summer Fields?
[01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:03.220]   I saw one more in the chat.
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:04.220]   I'll sneak in.
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:09.940]   What happens if the survivors can't find the original will and only have a copy?
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:14.580]   If that's the case, well, this is a very good question.
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:23.100]   It, a copy can be used as a substitute, but it's easier to have a copy used as a substitute
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:24.580]   for the original.
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:31.300]   If the original wasn't held by the testator, the person who did their will, and the reason
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:36.580]   for that is there's a legal presumption that if a will is lost or destroyed while it's
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:43.300]   in the custody of the testator, there's a legal presumption that he or she intentionally
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:48.200]   revoked the will or tore it up intending to revoke its terms.
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:55.500]   So it's harder to have a copy admitted as the replacement than if you have the attorney
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:53:00.860]   or if a friend or a family member has the will and it gets lost or destroyed.
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:07.420]   So the short answer is, yes, you can have a substitute copy be probated, but it's more
[01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:14.220]   likely that's more likely to work if you're not holding on to your own original will.
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:17.460]   What if like there's a fire and it burns with your house?
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:23.940]   I mean, I suppose if you can document, well, yeah, I suppose, well, yeah, I mean, I suppose
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:30.100]   there are scenarios where, you know, the testator has their own own will and you can somehow
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:34.580]   there's proof that they didn't destroy it or whatever.
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:41.200]   But all things being equal, you're better off having someone else hold it regardless
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:48.220]   of how the destruction happens, so.
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:56.140]   We have a question, Gorrie, and Kyle, I'm going to try to ask your question.
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:54:03.980]   It would involve a corporate trustee, I would imagine Kyle's question is whether to use
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:10.620]   a corporate trustee for your trust versus a family member as a trustee.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:17.400]   But I thought in a living trust or normally a regular trust, a revocable trust, the person
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:20.940]   making the trust would be the trustee.
[01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:27.820]   And then you have a co-trustee, which would be the corporation or your spouse or a child
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:29.460]   or a family member.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:36.380]   Right, or successor trustee, usually a lot of times for trust, you name yourself.
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:43.260]   And then but if you're disabled or incapacitated or pass away, it's a family member or a corporate
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:44.880]   trustee.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.880]   Corporate trustees can be good.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:52.440]   I mean, in my experience, and you hear that they're generally only willing to take on
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:58.680]   a trust or an executive position if there's like a million dollars or something.
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:06.560]   But you know, typically you it's good if you can have a family member be an executive or
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:10.400]   trustee so they can benefit from the commission.
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:17.400]   And also they can always they can have control and they can hire attorneys, accountants,
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.620]   investment people to help.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:26.800]   But certainly there are institutions that have served very well as executors, co-executors,
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:29.280]   trustees, co-trustees.
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:35.600]   So it's really just sort of a particular person's preference and where their loyalty, where
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:38.920]   they feel they'll get loyal service.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:46.280]   The person answered and says on the corporate trustee, we have minor children.
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:53.160]   If we die, while they're minors, our family would take the children and be excellent family
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:55.960]   figures for them and parents for them.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:58.640]   But they're not very money smart.
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:01.040]   They're very casual with money.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:06.720]   So therefore, we are considering a corporate trustee to manage some form of trust for life
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:14.240]   insurance policies, as well as our other financial assets, and this would be for the minor children.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:20.520]   Can you discuss the pros and cons of a corporate trustee in a scenario where they're being
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.560]   handling minor children?
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.560]   Right.
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:32.160]   Well, yeah, I would say the pros would be what you've described in terms of the corporate
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:40.400]   trustee having more savvy for financial management, investing, that kind of thing.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:48.960]   And also there can be a benefit too in having an outsider hold the funds, the family funds,
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:54.740]   because sometimes if you have a family member hold the funds, it can affect the relationship
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:59.120]   between the young people and the individuals holding the money.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:00.560]   There can be a tension there.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:07.220]   Whereas if you have an outsider, you kind of can avoid some of that.
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:18.040]   The potential downside, it's not a huge thing, but the corporate trustee is entitled to fees,
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:19.920]   statutory fees.
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:27.720]   So to the extent that an outsider is getting the fees as opposed to a family or friend,
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:32.000]   that could be considered a disadvantage.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.400]   The second thing, a potential disadvantage, and I think this goes to what we spoke of
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:44.360]   a little bit earlier in terms of having the right mindset for being an executor or being
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:47.280]   a fiduciary in terms of loyalty and service.
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:53.520]   I mean, you do hear about situations, see situations at times.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:58:01.920]   If the money situation changes, if God forbid, a lot of the funds in the trust need to be
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:12.080]   spent for medical or something unforeseen, and the trust balance goes down, does an institutional
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:22.120]   trustee necessarily have the loyalty and attachment to stay with the trust in lean times?
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:29.560]   I mean, a family member or a friend may not have that stick-to-itiveness either, but that's
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.960]   just something to consider.
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:40.720]   And then aside, I remember reading an article years ago in the New York Times about a corporate
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:41.720]   trustee.
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:48.440]   Well, I think he was an attorney, might've been an accountant who handled the trust of
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:56.760]   a family when the parents had been killed, and he basically raised the children from
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:59.240]   the financial point of view.
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:04.720]   And the article pointed out that there are actual people, trustees, corporate trustees
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:13.760]   who specialize in that, or whose practice is geared towards children and also special
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:17.560]   needs, trusts, that sort of thing.
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:23.720]   So you might have to search around to find one, but I think they're around.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:24.720]   Sure.
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:33.640]   There are attorneys who will be guardians, be trustees for private trusts.
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:39.640]   You're not necessarily limited to either a big bank or a family member.
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:46.440]   Summerfield, I noticed a question in the chat that I think is interesting.
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:54.680]   So we've evolved where electronic documents that are signed serve as bona fide legal documents,
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:57.480]   the equivalent of paper, original signatures.
[01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:00.560]   How does that apply to a will?
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:04.000]   Must a will be paper or is electronic valid?
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.980]   Yeah, that's an excellent question.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:18.140]   To my knowledge, yeah, I've never heard about a contemporary will being done on anything
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:21.540]   but paper.
[02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:29.420]   I mean, I don't think the statute specifies paper, but I think as a practical matter,
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:35.120]   unless it's some kind of an emergency where you're literally sort of passing away or something,
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:42.860]   I don't think you would want to take that risk and be sort of the test case by doing
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:45.020]   an electronic thing.
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:52.660]   I think you'd want to, for no other reason either than just having your will go through
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:01:00.260]   in a timely and standard manner as opposed to the novelty of having the court try to
[02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:05.700]   figure out what you've done, kind of as an alternative.
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:12.900]   So I would encourage just going with the tried and true, but yeah, the way I know for notarization
[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:16.780]   with COVID, they changed the rules on notarization.
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:23.820]   And I personally haven't done any of the remote video notarizing because the rules and regulations
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:29.900]   are so cumbersome and convoluted, it's just not worth it for me to try to figure it all
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:31.980]   out and deal with it.
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:37.180]   But as technology changes and stuff going forward, I guess we have to keep an eye on
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:38.180]   that.
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:39.180]   Right.
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:48.020]   It goes back to the written on the hide of a cow alternative.
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:02:01.020]   Yeah.
