[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.060]   They end up chanting in front of him, Viva la muerte. Long live death. They have their
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:16.460]   counterparts today. They are the people who taunt Americans, Westerners, Israelis, and others with
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.340]   lines like, we love death more than you love life.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.980]   The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray, author of The War in the West,
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.200]   The Madness of Crowds, and his new book on democracies and death cults. We talk about
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.340]   Russia and Ukraine and about Israel and Gaza. Douglas has very strong views on these topics,
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.900]   and he defends them brilliantly and fearlessly. As I always try to do for all topics, I will also
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.900]   talk to people who have different views from Douglas, including on the next episode of this
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.780]   podcast. We live in an era of online discourse where grifters, drama farmers, liars, bots,
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.020]   sycophants, and sociopaths roam the vast beautiful dark land of the internet. It's hard to know who
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.340]   to trust. I believe no one is in possession of the entire truth, but some are more correct than others.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.980]   Some are insightful, and some are delusional. The problem is it's hard to tell which is which
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:35.800]   unless you use your mind with intellectual humility and with rigor. I recommend you listen to many
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.860]   sources who disagree with each other and try to pick up wisdom from each. Also, I recommend you visit
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.500]   the places in question as Douglas as Douglas has, as I have, or at least talk face-to-face with people who
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.520]   have spent most of their lives living there, whether it's Israel, Palestine, Ukraine, or Russia.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.660]   Let's try, together, to not be cogs in the machine of outrage, and instead to reach toward reason and
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:12.460]   compassion. There is no Hitler, Stalin, or Mao on the world stage today. Plus, there are thousands of
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:21.300]   nuclear weapons ready to fire. Human civilization hangs in the balance. The 21st century is a new
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.240]   geopolitical puzzle all of us are tasked with solving. Let's not mess it up.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.160]   This is a Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.340]   And now, dear friends, here's Douglas Murray.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.020]   What have you understood about the war in Ukraine from your visits there? Just looking at the big
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.460]   picture of your understanding of the invasion of February 24, 2022, and the war in the three years
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.300]   since. Well, I mean, several things. There's political angles which are forever changing. But
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:06.100]   on the human level, as you know, if you visit troops, frontline troops, you have that admiration for
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.940]   people defending their country, defending their homes, defending their families. I'm struck by the way in
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:21.700]   which that is at a remove from the sort of political noise and the media noise and much more. It's very easy
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.420]   to get caught up in the to's and fro's of today's news. But that, to my mind, is that's the single thing
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:40.180]   that struck me most in my visits there. It's just the people I've met who are fighting for a cause
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.260]   which, at that level, is unavoidable, undeniable. So, the thing that struck you that's different from
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.300]   the media turmoil is just the reality of war. Yeah, of course. I mean, you know, people who
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:04.340]   have either lived under Russian occupation from invading armies and then come back out into the
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.580]   world having been liberated as in late 2022, or the people now organized most recently there in recent
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.420]   weeks who were just getting on with their job as soldiers whilst the world was talking about them.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.820]   When were you there? Early on in this escalated war of '22?
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.820]   Yes. First time I was with the Ukrainian armed forces when they retook Kurson. And I was back in recent
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:41.380]   weeks and was there when the Trump-Selensky blowup happened. In fact, I was in a Ukrainian dugout
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:50.660]   at the front lines when I was watching it. How's the morale? How's the way the content of the
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.460]   conversations you've heard different from the two visits separated by, I guess, two years?
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:08.980]   At one level, I mean, nothing has changed much. It's not a total standoff because intermittently
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.580]   each side gains territory from the others, but it's not. I mean, there have been no very significant
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.140]   military gains by either side in the interim period. I think my experience of the soldiers,
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:29.380]   the people of Ukraine early on in the war, there's an intense optimism about the outcomes of the war.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.260]   There's a sense that they're going to win. And the definition of what "win" means was like
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:45.700]   all the territory is going to be won back. Yeah. I certainly, on the front lines facing Crimea,
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.380]   became quite familiar with people who thought that the Ukrainians in late 2022 would even be able to
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.140]   get Crimea back. And that struck me even at the time. And I said, I thought that that was an overreach.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:07.460]   And now I think the people, the soldiers, at least in my experience when I visited a second time,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:19.540]   are more exhausted. The morale, the dreams, the certainty of victory has maybe faded from the
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.780]   forefront of their minds. Well, three years of war will tire out anyone.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:30.420]   What did you think of the blow up between Zelensky and Trump as you're sitting there in the dugout?
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:37.060]   Well, it was a very disturbing place to watch it from. Perhaps anywhere it would have been.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:45.140]   And, I mean, obviously it was a meeting that shouldn't have happened. It was far too early.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.340]   Why do you think so? There's not enough actual pathways to peace on the table?
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.420]   Well, I think the mineral deal, I mean, I love the fact that everyone's now an expert in
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.220]   Eastern Ukrainian mineral deposits. But...
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.780]   I think as I've learned, and we'll talk about Israel and Palestine, I'm learning that everybody's an
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.060]   expert on geopolitics and history of war on the internet. And now mineral deposits, obviously.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.900]   Yes. And I'm really speaking at the edge of my mineral deposit knowledge here.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.740]   Yeah. No, I mean, what I could see, the deal that the American administration was trying to
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:28.580]   get the Ukrainian government to sign. It was sort of too early, too forced. The Ukrainians were ready to
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:35.380]   sign a deal, but were obviously under intense pressure. And I think certainly Zelensky wasn't
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:45.460]   actually expecting to go until pretty much the day before. He was obviously visibly tired and exhausted,
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:52.100]   again, as you are after that amount of pressure for that long time. And no, I mean, the thing that struck
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.940]   me, and I said this in my column in the New York Post from there, that the thing that struck me was I said
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:06.820]   to some of the soldiers I was with, "What do you make of this?" And one of them just said to me,
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:14.660]   "Well, we're advised not to follow too closely the ins and outs of the politics of this." But of course,
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:20.740]   everyone has Instagram or scrolls and among dog pictures and the hot women or whatever is
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:30.100]   what happened in the Oval. But what struck me was this same guy and saying, "I've got a job to do."
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:43.700]   Right. And there's a clarity and a wisdom to that. But your job is bigger than that, right? It's to
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.900]   understand the politics as well. And what do you think about the politics of that moment? Because
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:56.020]   that was a real opportunity to come together and make progress on peace, right? And it, by all accounts,
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.340]   was not a successful step forward. I don't think by any account, it was a successful step forward,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:11.620]   unless to some extent it was a play, but from DC to say to Putin, "Look, we've daft off Zelensky and
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:21.300]   now give us something." That's the only remedial idea I have about what might have been behind it.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:33.940]   But I think it was just one of those extremely awful political moments. Zelensky was obviously deeply
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:44.260]   irritated by the interpretation of the war that he was hearing from Washington. It was only a week after
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:52.500]   the Trump comments about Zelensky being a dictator, and people in the administration implying that
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:10:01.620]   Ukraine has started the war. And I think that must be, for Zelensky, a pretty Alice in Wonderland
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:09.460]   situation to be in. And I had significant sympathy for him in finding it bewildering,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:18.180]   because it would be bewildering. I think the sad thing to me also, on the mundane details of that
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.940]   meeting, and just the unfortunate way that meetings happen, I think it's true that he was also exhausted.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.500]   Yes.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:31.620]   There was a dickhead of a reporter that was asked a question about outfit in a way that,
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.860]   listen, Zelensky, everybody has their strengths and weaknesses. He's an emotional being, for better or
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.260]   for worse. And there's a dumb dickhead of a reporter.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.860]   Marjorie Taylor Greene's boyfriend.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.980]   Oh, right.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.460]   He is.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.060]   The things you know. See, you're a real journalist.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.260]   He's from one of the new, I'm all for opening up the White House press pool and all that sort of
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:11:00.980]   thing. But it means that you get some people in who are sort of, yeah, from blog land, there's nothing
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.740]   wrong with that. But it means that you get somebody who will do something like that. The problem with
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:14.660]   that interaction, as I saw it, was that guy asked that more disrespectful question. And I think it was
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:22.500]   disrespectful. I'll very quickly say why. I mean, I think that when a man comes from the realm of war
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:29.300]   into the realm of peace, the people in the realm of peace should have some respect or at least concession
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:38.180]   that the other man has come from the realm of war. And that if you're sitting in a political environment
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:46.260]   where you talk about people being destroyed and decimated and defenestrated and much more to a
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:56.740]   man who's, for whom none of that is metaphorical, I think that's extremely hard to accept.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:07.140]   And I think that probably also at that moment, there was a sort of sense of, you know, Zelensky is
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:14.260]   being disrespected by being asked about what he's wearing. When, as everyone knows, you know, Churchill
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:20.180]   during World War II used to wear his fatigues on foreign visits. And it's just that, it's to remind
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:27.620]   people that you're coming from the realm of war. And I think that probably in that moment, one of the things
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.780]   that would have been going through his head would be, but I mean, if, if, if this was Putin sitting
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:37.060]   here being assaulted by a journalist, you know, you'd, you'd hope your host stepped in and defended you.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.740]   I mean, if, let me try this one out. I mean, if safe, if a, if a journalist in the Oval Office,
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:49.780]   if Putin was sitting there or a putative journalist said to Putin, you know, um, everyone knows you've
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.620]   had a lot of facial work done and, uh, word is you've used the same guy that Berlusconi used to use.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.460]   Um, can you comment on, on that? You, you, you'd, you'd, you'd say, well,
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:07.460]   that's a kind of disrespectful question for journalists to ask. And it's a little bit,
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:16.580]   um, off, off what needs to be gone over. Uh, and it's the same thing with Zelensky with the outfit.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.500]   I think it was just petty and, and, and, and threw things off in a bad way.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.260]   Yeah. And it was probably research because I think Zelensky was explained this like three years
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.420]   ago at the beginning of the war, why he wears what he wears. And he's been consistent wearing the same.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:35.460]   It's also, by the way, it's, it's an example of the frivolity of a lot of the, of the attempts to,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:42.820]   attempts to understand what's going on. I mean, my view is that, is that since actually most people,
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.060]   in fact, everybody cannot be an expert on everything. One of the things that we always
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:55.140]   do is to seize on minor and really quite unimportant things. I mean, I mean, every side does it look at
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.940]   the way in which the American right for years talked about the Churchill bust leaving the White House
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:06.020]   Oval Office in the Obama years. I didn't want to hear another darn thing about the Churchill bust
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:14.740]   after eight years, because it just, it was in lieu of trying to understand and actually critique Obama's
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:20.420]   foreign policy. It was just the easy shorthand. I think it's the same. We're always tempted to that.
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:25.220]   But the thing is, I think you mentioned Putin. I think Putin would have been able to
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:33.220]   respond himself to that journalist effectively. And he would have done it in Russian.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.140]   Oh yeah. The language thing.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.260]   Yeah. So I wanted to sort of lay out several just unfortunate things that happen in these
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.860]   situations. And I think it happens in all peace negotiations. And it's funny how history can turn
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.340]   in moments like this. I do think there's a dickhead reporter combined with the fact that
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.460]   the, you know, with all due respect, but Zelensky's English sometimes is not very good.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.660]   Yes. And apart from anything else, if he had to agree to not done it in English,
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.420]   he would have bought himself the extra seconds in some of his replies that he needed. Yeah.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:09.780]   Yeah. And have the wit, the guy is funny, witty, intelligent. You know, he could do that
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.900]   in the native language of whether it's Ukrainian or Russian to be able to respond and get the interpreter.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.180]   So all of that is really unfortunate. Cause I think on those little moments,
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:27.620]   it's a dance and there's an opportunity there, you know, the Republicans, the right wing in the United
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:34.740]   States have a general kind of skepticism of Zelensky and, and, but that doesn't mean it has to be that
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.140]   way. It can turn, it can change, it can evolve.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.020]   It's very interesting why it has happened. Why do you think it's happened?
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:48.180]   I think the politics in the United States is so dumb that at the very beginning, it could just be
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:57.300]   reduced to, well, the left went Putin bad, Zelensky good, rah, rah, Ukrainian flags. Therefore,
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.220]   the right must go the opposite. Yeah.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.340]   It's sometimes as literally as dumb as that. Let's each pick a side and call the other dumb.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:12.020]   I had a line I used recently, um, the necessity of people who live too long online to try to wade
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.820]   their way out of the means. It is so like that, isn't it? Because yes, I mean, I can understand the
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:22.420]   people who find it very irritating that so many people who would put BLM flags or pride flags or,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:28.260]   you know, trans flags in their bio, then put Ukrainian flags in their bio, despite almost certainly not
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.940]   knowing where Ukraine was. And, uh, if that happens, the inevitable instinct of a lot of
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.060]   people who aren't really thinking is to say, that's really annoying. These people are really
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.380]   annoying. I'll sock it to them. But that's where you've got to try to rise above that and say,
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.740]   actually, funnily enough, the fate of a country doesn't depend on my tolerance for memes online
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:56.980]   today. Yeah. So I think the memes can be broken through in meetings like the one that happened
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:03.220]   between Zelensky and Trump. There could have been real camaraderie. I've seen the skill of that just
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:10.820]   recently having researched deeply and interacted with Narendra Modi. Here's somebody who has the skill
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:19.460]   of, you know, for his country, for his situation, being able to somehow be friends with Putin and friends
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:25.140]   with Zelensky and friends with Trump and friends with Biden and friends with Obama.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:25.700]   That's very skillful.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:37.300]   And that while still being strong for his country and fundamentally a nationalist figure who's like,
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:46.100]   you know, very not globalist, not anything but pro-India, India first, nation first.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:51.460]   In fact, nation first with a very specific idea of what that nation represents.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.020]   Cool.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.980]   And that, you know, Zelensky could do all of those things,
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:04.180]   but have the skill of navigating the Trump room. Because every single leader has their own peculiar
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.940]   quirks that need to be navigated.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.620]   Yes. The obvious one, I mean, I don't want to make it sound like it was all Zelensky's fault,
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.220]   but I mean, the obvious one was at the beginning of the meeting to say yet again, as he has done for
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:18.260]   three years, thank you to America and the American people and American politicians from across the aisle
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:24.820]   for your support for my country and its hour of need. We're deeply grateful. And because he for
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.020]   once forgot to say that.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.060]   I think it's not that simple. I think there's a...
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.500]   It's not that simple. It's one reason.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.900]   I think saying thank you, he didn't need to say thank you.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.460]   There is just...
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.940]   That was why Vance, that was what Vance leapt in on.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:41.460]   He's just picking a thing to leap on. There's a whole energy. You have to
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:50.340]   acknowledge in your way of being that you have been very Biden, buddy, buddy with the left for the last
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:56.660]   four years. There's ways to fix that. Listen, these people are complicated narcissists,
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:03.060]   all of them, Biden, Trump. You have to navigate the complexity of that. And you basically have to
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:10.980]   say a kind word to Trump, which is like showing... There's many ways of doing that, but one of them is
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:17.140]   saying feeding the ego by acknowledging that he is one of the world's greatest negotiators, right?
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.980]   I'm glad we're able to come to the table and negotiate together because I believe you are the
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:30.420]   great negotiator, mediator that can actually bring a successful resolution to it as opposed to have
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:37.220]   an energy of like, it should be obvious to everybody that Ukraine are the good guys and Russia is the
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:42.820]   bad guys. There's this whole energy of entitlement that he brought. He forgot that there's a new guy.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:51.140]   You got to like convince the new guy that this global mission that this nation is on, this war
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:20:02.900]   that is in many ways, the West versus the East, that there's ideals, there's whole histories here,
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.740]   that this is a war worth winning. You have to convince them, right?
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:14.180]   Yeah, no, sure. And they obviously failed on that occasion. But as I say, it must be bewildering to
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:21.220]   have landed in a place where people were seriously talking about Ukraine starting the war and Zelensky,
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:29.220]   not Putin being the dictator. I did the front page of the New York Post the day after the President's
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:35.300]   comments on that saying that, the big picture of Putin just saying, right, this is a dictator. And
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:42.660]   you know, I think that people can be live enough to be able to recognize that, you know, you can make
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:49.940]   criticisms of Zelensky or the Ukrainians, but it doesn't mean you have to fall full Putin. And again,
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.780]   unfortunately, a lot of people in our time don't have that capability.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:59.540]   Can we go right into it? What is your strongest criticism of Putin?
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:07.060]   He's a dictator who's very bloody, as repressive as you can be of political opposition, internal
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:14.420]   opposition. He's kleptomaniac of his country's resources, has enriched himself as much as he could,
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:25.620]   as he has with the cronies around him. He's not just acted to destroy internal opposition in Russia,
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:33.300]   but has gone to other countries, including my own country of birth and killed people on their, our soil,
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:41.540]   using, as it happens, weapons of mass destruction. The use of polonium in the center of London,
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:48.580]   not good. The use of incredibly dangerous nerve agents that could kill tens of thousands of
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:55.060]   people in a charming cathedral city like Salisbury, not good. If the sort of apologists of Putin would
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:00.020]   say, well, he's just a sort of tough man who's looking after his house business. Well, I don't
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.180]   think, even if you think he has the right to do that, that he should be doing it in third countries,
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:12.740]   deliberately using weapons that are meant to show that you could take out tens of thousands of British
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:20.500]   citizens. Yeah, I mean, that's just for starters. What do you make for, do you think he's actually
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:29.860]   popularly elected? No. Do you think the results of the elections are fraudulent? Yes. I mean,
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.700]   do you think it's possible that it's just that the opposition has been eliminated and he's
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:41.460]   legitimately popularly elected? It definitely helps a chap if he's killed all of his opponents.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.420]   something by using the term chap in that context is just marvelous.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:55.380]   I mean, seriously, if people are worried about, this is another of the sort of slightly Alice
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.180]   in Wonderland things recently about Zelensky is people are saying, well, he's a dictator because
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:07.140]   he hasn't held elections during a total war of self-defense. And it's like, well, you know,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.940]   if you're really, really passionate about free and fair elections in that neck of the woods,
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.260]   you'd at least notice that the Russian elections are not free and fair in any meaningful sense.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:24.900]   But this doesn't mean that you have to say that therefore they should have Western style elections
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.860]   and, and, and freedom that Russia is, is ready to go and become a Western liberal democracy. It
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.820]   doesn't mean any of that at all. It's just at least note that this is what Putin is.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:40.100]   What do you think is the motivation for his invasion of Ukraine in 22?
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:46.420]   It's what he's said for years, which is the basic, the reconstitution of the Soviet Union.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:52.260]   Do you think there's empire building components to that motivation?
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:24:01.220]   I would trust most my friends in Eastern Central Europe who certainly do think that there's a
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.500]   reason why the Baltic countries are the countries that are spending highest in percentage of GDP on
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:13.140]   defense. And it's because they're very worried. I don't think they're faking it. I don't think
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.780]   they're faking it for me or for anyone else. I think the Lithuanians, Latvians, the Estonians,
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.900]   and others are genuinely worried for the first time in some decades.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:29.860]   Do you think there's a possibility that the war continues indefinitely?
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:37.300]   Even if there's a ceasefire and the peace reached, the war will resume and he will seek expansion even
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:44.660]   beyond Ukraine? Yes. And the most obvious thing is that if Trump manages to negotiate a ceasefire,
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:53.460]   it'll be a temporary pause. And whoever comes in as president after Trump, Putin will use the
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:00.260]   opportunity to advance again. Yes. Again, one of the things that I have heard from parts of the
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:07.140]   American right and others is that all he wants is Ukraine, that that's all he wants and that he has no
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:15.460]   history of rhetoric or actions that suggests anything else. And again, it's one of the reasons why it's
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.700]   useful traveling to places and seeing things with your own eyes, because I very much remember being in
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:30.500]   the country of Georgia after Putin tried to invade in 2008. So I just, again, people don't have to be
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:37.460]   the greatest supporters of the Ukrainian cause just to recognize that, that it doesn't seem to be the case,
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.820]   that Ukraine is the only thing in Putin's vision.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:48.500]   Do you see value and maybe depth and power to the realist perspective of all this? You know, somebody like
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:58.820]   John Mearsheimer's formulation of all this, that in these invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, it's using
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:05.860]   military power to expand the sphere of influence in the region in a cold calculation of geopolitics.
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:11.140]   It's interesting. One of the fascinating things about the last few years is there's been an act of sort
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:20.500]   of necromancy of certain figures were totally, totally debunked in the area of Ukraine, Mearsheimer,
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:26.980]   and in the case of Israel, people like Finkelstein. And it's been interesting because these are people
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:33.460]   that one hadn't heard of for some years because they were not listened to, usually for good reason.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:39.300]   But by the way, first of all, I'm very skeptical of the term realist in foreign policy because
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:45.860]   most people to some extent will say that they are a realist in foreign policy.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:53.300]   Very few people are surrealists in foreign policy. Very few people are unrealists.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.340]   I would like to meet them.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.580]   A surrealist foreign policy analyst.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.140]   We did mention Alice in Wonderland.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:05.460]   Yeah. I mean, maybe we should introduce the term, but I mean, if you want to say,
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:11.780]   if you want to look gimlet out, eyed out across the world, you're a realist. I think the steel man of
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:21.220]   their argument would be Russia has, or believes it has a sphere of influence and is regrettable,
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.300]   But there's very little we can do about that.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:29.780]   That would be about the best version of that argument that you can make.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:36.660]   Well, to expand on that, steel man, isn't this how superpowers operate in the dark,
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:43.780]   realist slash surrealist way? Meaning the United States uses military power
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:52.420]   to have a sphere influence over the whole globe, really. China appears to be willing to use military
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.820]   power to expand its sphere of influence.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.620]   And political power, yeah. More importantly, in the case of China.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.740]   Political power.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:05.060]   Non-kinetic warfare to take over areas, Hong Kong being the obvious one.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.380]   But behind that, isn't there always a kinetic threat?
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.900]   Oh yeah, of course, yeah. I mean, you disappear some booksellers and
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:19.620]   students who are protesting, of course. But to go back to this, yeah, of course.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.740]   Okay, countries believe they have or would like to have spheres of influence.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.820]   I do think at some point that the so-called realists on that have to
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:36.660]   try to decide how much leeway that allows you to give to a fairly rapacious regime.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:45.700]   And it's not the easiest calculation always to make. You have to work out whether or not,
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:52.260]   for instance, it is true that if Russia had, if Putin had managed to go all the way to Kyiv in the
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:59.540]   first weeks of the war in 22, he would have gone straight on to other places. And, you know,
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.100]   maybe he would have done, maybe he would have taken his time, maybe he wouldn't have done. And this is a
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   very fine calculation that changes every week, let alone every year.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:17.700]   You know, my friends in Georgia, I thought, were wildly off the mark when they were believing that
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:24.340]   after 2008, they could get, for instance, either NATO membership or EU membership. And I thought that was
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:30.180]   completely unlikely, and I still think it's unlikely and almost certainly undesirable for Europe and for NATO.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:35.620]   Because you've got to be very careful as, and obviously, this is one of the issues with Ukraine and has been
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:44.020]   since the '90s is, you know, are you going to set up a tripwire to start World War III? And that's not a small thing to consider.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:56.180]   So what do you think the peace deal might look like? And what does the path to peace look like in Ukraine in the coming weeks and months?
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:02.900]   I just thought it would be, regrettably, the Ukrainians seeding some territory in the east,
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:13.620]   and then making sure they rearm during whatever peace period comes afterwards.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:22.500]   And probably all four territories of Donetsk-Lukhan's separation are on.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:27.220]   You couldn't lay any of that out because it has to be negotiated on. But I mean, I think that,
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:32.260]   and I think the ease with which non-Ukrainians are currently speaking about the Ukrainian seeding
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:40.260]   territory is concerning because these territories include hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:46.500]   who do not want to live under Putin's rule, and people who have families in the rest of Ukraine,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:55.620]   and much more. And, you know, I recently interviewed children who had managed to get out of the Russian
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:10.420]   occupied areas. And it's brutal for the Ukrainian to be growing up in that territory. So when people say,
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:19.380]   well, obviously, you know, Donetsk has to be given to Putin, I think that that is not as easy a thing if
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:25.380]   you're in Ukraine, as it is if you're sitting in New York, say. And by the way, I think that on the
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:31.460]   issue of, there is a school of thought that is, that obviously, President Trump, to some extent, was
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:39.380]   floating in recent weeks, which is that if a deal is done, a business deal in relation to minerals or
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:45.540]   anything else, you get this great, you get a kind of buffer zone of American businesses and investment,
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:52.820]   and therefore American business people in the region, which would effectively warn Putin not to
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:32:01.140]   invade. I don't follow that idea, because not least, there were Americans in the regions that were
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:07.380]   invaded in 22, and they left fast. And we know from Hong Kong and other places, just because there are
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.540]   international financial interests in the region does not mean that the dictatorship will not
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:23.380]   either militarily or covertly take over. I don't see American minors as being an effective buffer zone
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:30.580]   against Putin. By the way, what did you learn from talking to the children, Ukrainian children from
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:39.700]   those regions? Well, I mean, it's heartbreaking, because the only schooling is Russian schooling.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:47.780]   obviously teaching the Russian language, Putin's view of history, and effectively indoctrination.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:54.100]   And people can quibble with that term, but it's Putin-esque indoctrination schools.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:33:02.580]   And any children or families that do not want that effectively have to hide and not go out.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:08.820]   And there were, I spoke to children and parents who'd had school friends who'd had, for instance,
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:16.020]   the Russians set up in 22 and 23 summer camps for the children of some of the areas that have been
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:21.460]   occupied, and the children went off to the camps and then they didn't come back. They were just stolen.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:27.620]   I mean, it's thought that around 20,000 Ukrainian children have been stolen in this fashion. That's not a small thing.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:35.620]   It's not got very much attention. But yes, I mean, children who would hide whenever the Russian
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:43.300]   troops came to the door. One teenage boy who described to me how when his mother was out,
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:52.980]   a woman came around the house, knocked on the door, and gave him his papers, and said that he had to
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:34:03.940]   attend the next week to sign up for the Russian army. I mean, this is not good. And that's obviously what
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:10.260]   life is like for thousands of people behind the Russian lines in Ukraine. I just have it in mind
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.660]   when people say things like, well, obviously these regions have to be handed over. It's very, very hard
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:22.740]   if you're Ukrainian to concede to that. Yeah. And even if they are as part of the negotiation handed
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:30.260]   over, I think it'll probably be generations or never that that could be accepted by Ukrainian people.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.980]   Absolutely. And I would have thought never. What do we know about this kidnapping of children,
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.620]   the stories of the thousands of children that the Russian forces kidnapped?
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:48.100]   Yeah. Some of them were in orphanages in Eastern Ukraine. Not all, by any means. But some were.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:54.340]   And it's a very complicated story, actually, because many children were taken from their families.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:35:00.100]   Many of the Russians said, well, look at these Ukrainians. They don't even look after their
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:06.340]   children. Therefore, we will look after them. And I was recently, when I was there, looking into this
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.300]   story, because it's a very interesting question as to why it hasn't had more attention. You know,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:17.780]   one thinks of, for instance, the abduction of the Chibok schoolgirls some 12 years ago now in northern
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:26.500]   Nigeria, and the appalling abduction of 300 girls by Boko Haram completely gained the world's attention. And I
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:32.180]   was very interested into why the Ukrainian children who'd been taken by the Russians had not gained similar
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:37.140]   attention. There's a slight similarity with the war in Israel, which I'm sure we'll come on to. But
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:45.620]   I do think that one reason is that they were effectively hostages. And the Ukrainians knew,
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:53.940]   this is my estimation of the terrain, is that the Ukrainians knew that if they made a great deal about
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:59.620]   this, or as it were, more than they did, that the children would effectively be the most effective
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:06.420]   bargaining chip. And I do think there's considerable truth in that. Because if you look at, for instance,
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:14.340]   the way in which pressure has been put on the Israeli government by the Israeli population about the
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:25.620]   kidnapped Israelis, you'll see that it's a pretty effective tactic for any totalitarian regime or terrorist
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:31.060]   terrorist group to operate in a way that means that the population of the country you're attacking
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:39.780]   pressure their government to do something in terms of concession. It's a very effective tool. And I think
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.660]   that story was partly played down, not just outside of Ukraine, but also within Ukraine, partly for that
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:53.300]   reason. As a truth seeker, as a journalist, how do you operate in that world where, at least to me,
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:59.540]   it's obvious that there's just a flood of propaganda on both sides. Now, of course, when you go there and
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:06.340]   directly experience it and talk to people, uh, but those people are still also swimming in the propaganda.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:12.100]   So unless you witness stuff directly, sometimes it's hard to know. Like I speak to people on the Russian
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:29.700]   side. Uh, which makes me realize, I mean, you, you can be completely lied to, maybe I am in the United
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:38.260]   States as well and just be unaware. Um, maybe earth is run by aliens. Maybe the earth is flat. So I don't
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:43.940]   know. Maybe you've taken mushrooms. I have before this and I finally see the truth.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:51.300]   And it's you that are deluded Douglas. Okay. But, uh, back to the, our round earth discussion,
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.660]   round of shills that we are, uh, how do you know what is true? You, you can tell it when
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:08.020]   the bare facts become not true. Like you can tell it when somebody is willing to claim that everything
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:15.140]   caused the invasion of 2022, except for Vladimir Putin invading Ukraine.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:20.500]   Yeah. There's a, there's a hilarious thing that happens. And I think you've actually speak about
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:26.340]   this, that, uh, people are generally just much more willing to criticize the democratically elected
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.420]   leader. Always, always.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:35.300]   So the interesting thing that happens is these wise sages that do the narratives of like NATO started
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:41.540]   the war, right? Which there is some interesting geopolitical depth and truth to that. Like that
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:47.220]   NATO expansion created a complicated geopolitical context, whatever, sure. But they forget to say
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:51.940]   like other parts of that story. Well, yes, of course. I mean, and I mean,
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.860]   of course, to some extent it's rather, you know, that there's a, there's a very, the most irritating
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:01.860]   type of question asker at any event is the person who says, I was disappointed that in your 30 minute
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.900]   talk, you didn't address X. And I tend to say, well, looking forward to coming to your next talk,
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.380]   where in 30 minutes, you'll cover everything that could possibly be covered. Um, there's always
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.660]   stuff that's going to be left on the sides. There's always going to be stuff that's left
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.500]   unaddressed. There's always going to be other angles. There's always going to be somebody else who,
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:23.380]   who, who, who has this interesting perspective and you can't cover it. Nevertheless, if you cover
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:30.420]   everything other than the central things, then it's suspicious. Many years ago, I was at a debate in
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:38.500]   London, uh, and there was a debate about the origins of world war II and, uh, Pat Buchanan talking of
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:50.420]   necromancy was one of the, the, the, the speakers and, um, Andrew Roberts historian was one of the people
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:57.940]   on the other side. And at one point, you know, they got so completely stuck into issues of iron ore mining
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:04.340]   in Poland, in the mid, you know, something like this. And the moderator, I remember it was just,
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:09.700]   it was just a melee. And the moderator turns to Andrew Roberts and says, Andrew Roberts, why did
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:15.460]   world war two begin? And he says, world war two began because Hitler invaded Poland.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:24.500]   And it was a magnificent moment because everything had been a mush. They were just so lost in all the
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:29.700]   intricate and clever and interesting things that you can talk about, about the origins of a war that you've,
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:39.540]   you forget to mention the thing that's most important. And certainly my experience as a journalist and
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:46.180]   writer is that one of the reasons why you need to go and see things with your own eyes is because people
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:52.180]   are certain to tell you that what you've seen with your own eyes didn't happen or hasn't happened.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:41:00.100]   And it helps to steal you. Yeah. For that moment. It's a gradual thing that happens where
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.620]   the obvious thing starts being taken for granted and people stop saying it because it's like the boring
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:12.900]   thing to say at a party. And then all of a sudden over time, you just almost start questioning whether,
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:17.060]   whether, you know, like the obvious thing is even true. I don't know what that,
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:22.260]   how that happens in psychology. Yeah. I think it does. I think it does. I've observed it in a lot of
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:27.380]   different places, which is the important thing is the only thing you do forget. Everything else is what
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.180]   you remember. And some of us are for some reason wired in a way where we, we don't, we try not to
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.060]   forget the important thing. Remember the obvious thing. Yeah.
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:39.780]   Yeah. Yes. And as you say, no, I'm not wanting to be the boring guy at the party who reiterates what
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:44.020]   is true because what a douchebag you'd be if you were that guy.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:51.700]   Nobody likes Captain Obvious at a party. Okay. Is it possible that Donald Trump is a mediator,
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:57.860]   a successful negotiator that brings a stable peace to Ukraine?
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:04.500]   It's possible. We'll have to see. I think it's just too early and complicated to tell.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.380]   That he wants to bring a peace seems to me to be obvious. He stated it a lot of times.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:17.380]   Whether he can, we're just going to have to see. It's extremely hard to see some of the parameters
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:24.500]   of the peace still. And I would suggest that the most one, not the most difficult, but one of the most
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:31.140]   difficult is that there is no peace guarantee on paper that the Ukrainians can possibly believe.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:39.300]   I just, it doesn't matter because we've, we, we in the West, we, some of the countries in the West
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:49.140]   have said it before that we'd secure their, their peace. And we haven't. And so what other than NATO
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:54.260]   membership, which is not possible in my view, what other than NATO membership would reassure the
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:00.100]   Ukrainians that they are going to have their borders secured and the peace of Ukraine secured?
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.780]   I can't see.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:09.540]   I think, uh, there's not going to be ever a guarantee that you can trust. I think the way you have a
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:16.420]   guarantee, implicit guarantees by having military and economic partnerships with as many partners as
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:22.980]   possible. So you have partnerships with, uh, the, uh, uh, the Middle East have partnerships with India,
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:28.100]   perhaps even with China, with the United States, with many nations in Europe, all of which are
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:36.660]   still suggests that if there's enough financial interests in Ukraine, they would prevent another
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:43.860]   Russian invasion. There will be financial pressure. Yeah. That would be, uh, you know,
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:54.100]   Russia needs to be friends with somebody, either China or the West. Uh, I think a world that's
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:44:00.100]   flourishing, it would have Russia trading and being friends with the West and the East.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:07.220]   It would be ideal. It would be ideal if, if, if they were, if, uh, the regime and Moscow wanted it,
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:13.940]   but that's that not, I mean, there, again, you get into the thing of, you know, uh, people accused of
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:22.260]   Russophobia, but I mean, um, the, the, I do believe that after the fall of the wall, uh, Russia was ill-treated
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:29.140]   by the West, not treated with the, uh, some of the courtesy that it required. I do think that,
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:37.460]   and at the same time, that doesn't justify, uh, the actions of Russia in the last 20 years.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:44.900]   Right. But let's descend from the surrealist to the realist. It's very possible for Russia to,
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:53.540]   uh, be on the verge of military invasion of these nations and that being wrong while also not doing
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:59.620]   it because they're afraid to hurt the partnerships with the West and with China.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:06.100]   It's possible, but the alliance they formed with this sort of rogue, uh, alliance with China to a
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:16.820]   considerable extent, North Korea, not useful. Uh, and Iran is, um, something they seem to find
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:22.100]   bearable. It's not a very, it's not a very good alliance in most people's analysis, but it's an
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:28.740]   alliance. It's bearable, but I don't think maybe you disagree with this. I don't think the Russian
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:35.940]   people or even Putin, uh, wants to be isolated from the West. I think it wants to be friends with the
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:42.340]   West and with the East and with everybody who just also wants Ukraine. Right. And there's,
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:47.860]   uh, uh, how does the Rolling Stones song go? Which one?
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:53.300]   Uh, not the satisfaction one. Simply with the devil.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.420]   That's the one you got me on that one. No, like there, there's interests,
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.660]   whether it's expanding the sphere and influence, that's one thing on the table,
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:07.860]   the table, but that can be put aside. If you want to maintain the partnerships with these nations.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:13.940]   And, uh, if Ukraine has strong economic partnerships with those nations,
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.740]   then that prevents Russia from invading.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:24.420]   I think the premise is one that I've seen before. Um, there was a famous, uh, what was his name?
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:32.660]   Norman Angle. He wrote this book was a fantastic bestseller in his day where he believed that Europe
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:39.140]   would be in a period of endless Canty and peace because the prospect of European powers going to
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:49.380]   war was so economically unviable. The book was reissued after world war one. Um, and I never got the second
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:55.220]   edition, but I assume it was significantly rewritten. That's a very kind of cynical take that just because
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:59.140]   the book is wrong, I'm not saying just the book. So I'm saying that the, that the idea that
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:07.940]   that cooperation on an economic and other levels is any
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:15.940]   significant preventative device to madness breaking out is, is not something I see,
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:22.500]   could deter some people, right? It could deter some very, very rational, economically driven
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:28.660]   actors, but it, it fails to take into account all of the other things that motivate people to go to war
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:34.420]   and to invade and to go mad. Okay. Well, I would argue that in the 21st century, one of the reasons
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:42.500]   we have much fewer wars is because of the much more, well, so there's a few tools here on this, on the
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:49.220]   geopolitical stage. One of them is that you were just much more interconnected economically, globally
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:56.020]   interconnected. And that, that is always a present pressure on the world to keep peace. There's a lot of
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:01.140]   money to be made from peace. There's also a lot of money to be made from war. There's just, there's a
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:08.020]   lot of interest attention. And I, I'm just presenting one of the tools that a leader should be using. The
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:16.020]   alternative is what military force. That is an interesting one, sometimes a useful one, but
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:23.220]   unfortunately it has its downsides also. And after three years of war and the hundreds of thousands
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:28.340]   dead, you have to start wondering what are the options on the table?
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:39.300]   I agree. I'm, I'm obviously for economic cooperation, but my only caveat is not to think that that is
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:50.260]   something which is of ultimate interest or even at the top of the list of interests of, uh, despots,
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.260]   tyrants, extremists who want something else.
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:49:00.260]   Yeah. But, uh, can you read the mind of Vladimir Putin?
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:00.500]   No.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:06.260]   A lot of the ideas I hear about peace is
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:13.300]   Putin bad, victory must be achieved, NATO membership required.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:19.700]   there's this kind of like, uh, but what's the, what's the, what's the, you have to come to the
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:29.940]   table to, to end the killing is one and, uh, to have different ideas of how to, uh, have a non-zero
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:35.780]   chance of peace. So that, you know, the options are, it seems to me the only option,
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:42.500]   not the only option, but the likeliest option is a lot of strong economic partnerships. There's of
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:49.220]   course other radical options. There's, uh, there's, uh, Russia joining NATO or something like this,
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:56.660]   or there's, um, giving, you know, doing flirting with world war three, essentially giving nukes to
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:03.620]   Ukraine or something like this. There's like crazy stuff or a totally new military alliance with
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:11.540]   France and, and, and Britain and Germany and, uh, European nations and Ukraine or some weird network
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:19.060]   of military power that threatens Russia in some way, or maybe some big breakthrough partnership between
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:26.740]   India, China and Ukraine, something like this, just some really out there ideas. And I think that's how
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:33.300]   the world, that that's how the world finds a balance and realigns itself in interesting ways.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:40.900]   And look, it could be, I, I, I, I hope you're, uh, I hope your idea is right. Um, I think it's about the,
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:49.540]   well, it's certainly the most peaceful way for this to be resolved. My only caveat, as I say is,
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:57.140]   and also never forget to factor in that people want different things in this world.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:04.660]   And some people don't dream as you dream. I think we'll talk about this in your new book,
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:10.900]   death cults. That one is an easier one for me to understand to the story that you're describing.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:19.620]   I am more hesitant to assign psychopathy to leaders of major nations.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:23.460]   Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm not by any means urging you to regard
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:29.380]   Vladimir Putin as a millinarian madman who cannot be in any way understood.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:34.260]   I think he could be negotiated and reasoned with.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.820]   From your lips to God's ears.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:43.380]   Can you steel me on the case for and then against Zelensky as the right leader for Ukraine at this
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:48.500]   moment? Is he the right person to take it to the, the, the point of peace?
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:55.220]   We'll see if, if, if, if, if he can, then he, then of course he is, you know, he deserves enormous
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:52:02.500]   respect for galvanizing his people, for being elected in the first place, for galvanizing his nation
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:09.620]   in a time of incredible peril, um, for playing the international game of getting support for his
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:17.140]   country well. Um, and sometimes the person who does that, not that there are many people like that,
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.940]   can be the person who also brings about a peace deal and sometimes not.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:26.340]   I think there's a degree to which he may have seen too much suffering of the people,
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:36.260]   the land he loves to be able to sit down at a table with a world leader who, uh, did the destruction
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:40.500]   and to be able to compromise on anything.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:48.580]   That's, that's possible. Again, it puts the onus on him though, sort of slightly presupposes that
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:54.660]   Putin doesn't have the same human instinct on that. It is extremely hard. I've noticed this in
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:53:02.020]   a lot of conflicts. It's extremely hard the way in which outsiders come in and others who haven't seen
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:06.340]   what you've seen or gone through what you've gone through and say, you know, it's time to get around
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:12.980]   the negotiating table and just, you know, you think you didn't see what I saw or you didn't go through
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:19.140]   what I went through. Who are you to tell me? Goes back to that thing of the visitor from the land of
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:27.140]   war and the visitor from the land of peace. The visitor from the land of peace can easily talk about
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:34.820]   getting around negotiating tables, but the visitor from the land of war has seen other things and, um,
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:42.260]   it's, it's, it's very hard for somebody who hasn't seen it to tell the person who has that they should
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:46.420]   act differently. And the sad thing
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:54.500]   about humanity is both the, the person from the land of peace and the person from the land of war are
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:54:03.860]   right. Yes, that's a struggle. That's definitely a struggle. It's like asking somebody to forgive. I've seen
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:08.980]   that a lot, a lot of ends of conflicts. People say, you know, the important thing is that we forgive
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:17.780]   and move on. And then the other person says, you know, your child didn't die of shrapnel wounds.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:22.260]   Yeah, this is, you know, I got a lot of heat for an interview I did with Zelensky.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:28.180]   By the way, people privately, the people that message me is, is all love and support. Even the people that disagree,
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:33.780]   in Ukraine, Ukraine soldiers, uh, people online are ruthless. They're misrepresenting me. They're lying.
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.580]   People online are ruthless and misrepresenting and lying.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:41.140]   Yeah. Good God, Lex, you discovered a new, uh, phenomenon.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.500]   I'm a real radical intellectual.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:48.420]   Nothing misses your eye.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:55.140]   I see the truth and I'm unafraid to point it out. Uh, no, there's a degree,
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:00.820]   this, this idea that you
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:08.020]   need to compromise with the person, with the leader of a nation you're at war with.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:15.620]   And in so doing to some degree are forgiving their actions because the actual feeling you have
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:20.500]   is you want it to be fair. And the definition of fair, when you've seen that much suffering
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:28.180]   is for him and everybody around him and maybe even all of the people on the other side to just die
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:34.660]   because you've seen towards suffering. But the other side of that is, yes, there's children that have
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:41.220]   died. But you go coming to the negotiation table, other children from dying. Yes, of course.
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:47.860]   And so like, there is just, you had this kind of way of speaking about it, embodying that perspective,
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:55.060]   that it's naive to say, to come to the negotiation table. And it is for a person from the land of war,
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:56:00.660]   but the very smart, intelligent, and not naive person from the land of peace that is often right
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:08.420]   in some deep sense about the long arc of history. For them, it is the right thing to come to the
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:13.700]   negotiation table to end the war killing. The one thing I would add to that though is,
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:19.220]   don't forget that it also depends on whether or not there's a clear shot of winning.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:26.100]   Sure. If there's a clear shot of winning, and that's the most important. The most important
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:33.220]   thing in wars is not final negotiations or anything like that. It's simply winning and losing. And if you
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:41.060]   have a clear shot of winning and you can take it and you're near it, then having somebody else come in and
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:49.860]   saying, why not stop just before victory is very hard. That's one of the many, many complexities of
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:54.580]   the conflict we're talking about. You know, what's the other big complexity of that? Because the clear
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:57:01.380]   shot of winning is like a man walking through the desert, seeing water. It could be during war, it really
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:10.020]   is an illusion. So here's what happens. The really complicated aspect of negotiation is in order to negotiate
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:18.020]   peace from a place of strength. You have to have victory in sight.
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:18.820]   Yes.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:25.620]   And so the temptation from that position is to not negotiate, is to keep pushing forward to achieve
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:36.100]   victory. And this, I would say, hindsight is 20-20, but this is the failure in 22 and two occasions
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:47.940]   to achieve, to negotiate a ceasefire in peace. One in the spring, because Ukraine was in a real big,
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:55.620]   I would say, position of strength, having fended off the Russian forces around Kyiv. That's one. And then,
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:58:03.380]   as you mentioned, in the fall of 22 with Kherson and Kharkiv had a lot of military success. They were in a place
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:09.780]   of strength. And from that place, they've decided to keep going because victory was in sight. But that
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.780]   was also an opportunity to make peace. It's perfectly possible, yes.
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:22.260]   That's the hard thing. It's very hard. It's all hard. But again, victory can be won in wars,
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:28.020]   and is often won in wars. And you're right, they can also grind on because nobody
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:36.660]   has the capability to make a breakthrough. It's the case, I mean, the wisdom about civil wars tends
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:43.940]   to be that they sort of burn out after about 10 years or so for similar reasons.
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:48.500]   When you're in the war, can you actually know that a victory can be won?
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:55.380]   It's a very good question. And you mean troops on the battlefield or military leaders or
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.100]   political leaders?
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:02.260]   Military and political leaders. It just feels like, like I said, man in the desert seeing water. I think
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:11.140]   there's a sense that victory is so close. There's times in a war when you feel like victory is close.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.100]   No, you're right. And then it just slips away.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:19.780]   Yes, it's an interesting insight. It's like the way in which there's a force in nature,
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:32.820]   which is that if you amass an army, amassing it will pull you in to using it. Extremely hard to amass
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:39.620]   an army somewhere and then say, let's go back. Yes, you're right. No, it's one of many,
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:47.140]   many interesting aspects to warfare. I think the sad thing about successful wars,
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:55.700]   at least in the modern day, is it takes a great military leader, which I would argue that Zelenskyy
[00:59:55.700 --> 01:00:03.700]   really unified Ukraine in this fight, in the beginning of the war. You have to be that and,
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:09.540]   like you said, after you amass the army and have military success, to be able to step back and make
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:19.140]   peace. Those two just don't often go hand in hand. Because again, as a wartime leader, especially one who's
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:28.100]   seen the suffering firsthand, walking away is tough. Especially also combined with that,
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:34.660]   just the realities of war where there is probably corruption, that there is things, you know, once
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:41.300]   the war ends, there has to be investigations. Because the war wasn't won, you might not turn out to be,
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:47.860]   when history looks at it, the good guy. And a leader doesn't want to, a leader always wants to be the good
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:53.540]   guy. And so there's just all psychological complexities that are, and you look at this whole picture,
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:01:01.700]   uh, in, in the basic sense, if you want Ukraine to flourish, if you want humanity to flourish,
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:07.300]   you just ask the question, okay, so what is the thing I would like to see?
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:16.740]   There's so many historical analogies that you can give, but just surely not rewarding.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:30.580]   Putin's actions in any way would be a good way to deter him and other dictators from trying to grab land
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:39.940]   in the future. So yeah, and, but this is nuanced because like you, it's very probably good to be the
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:48.180]   boring person at the party that says dictatorships are bad. Uh, democracies are good. Many of the
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.860]   ideals of the West are good. Democracies are better. Better? Yes. Yeah.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:59.300]   Uh, that sounds like animal farm, but yes, two legs better. Um, but yes, democracy is better and, uh,
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:10.420]   invading countries is bad. Uh, but world war three is bad too. So after you say something is bad,
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:14.340]   what's the next step? Cause military intervention in a lot of these conflicts,
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:20.020]   it'll be about deterrence. Yeah. But what's, what's effective deterrence that we're going to have to
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:27.940]   keep going over for a long time to come. My question is how can we achieve peace in April,
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:37.860]   in May, right? Not like the adults at the table all seem to tell me, well, it's a process. It's
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:43.620]   complicated. You know, there is, it just feels like this is a thing that might go into the next winter
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:49.620]   and they're still, um, maybe initial ceasefire and the ceasefire is broken and there's more people
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:58.420]   dying. And it's that mess. It seems like civility and politeness ignores the fact that people are dying
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:03.220]   every single day. I mean, of course, like we were all every, almost everybody, not everybody, but almost
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:08.180]   everyone would like the killing to stop immediately. Of course. No, like I, I think that is the boring
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:12.980]   thing at the party. Yes, but they don't say it often enough. Not often. There has to be a frustration.
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:19.140]   They should say more. There has to be a frustration. I don't understand why Putin, Zelensky and Trump
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:26.580]   can't just meet in a room together without signing anything. Leaders meeting and discussing and like
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:32.180]   the human connection. There's so many layers of diplomats. It's the problem I have with a managerial
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:37.940]   class. I don't, they schedule meetings really well. They don't get shit done. And I, I would love it if
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:45.780]   people got shit done. So the soldiers get shit done. They have, they're fighting the reality of the war.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:52.820]   And then the leaders have the capacity to get shit done on the, on the scale of nations and geopolitics,
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:58.420]   but like this diplomatic meetings. And I share your frustration about it at the same time. I think,
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.940]   well, I share your frustration because I've seen it all, a lot of it, you know, in my own eyes,
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:11.220]   I mean, there was a botanine I was with the other week and they were hit just after I left their base.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:16.660]   And you wouldn't believe what a thermobaric bomb can do to the human body.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:27.860]   And I share your frustration with that. At the same time, one of the things that happens if you are rushing
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:36.180]   is that you do, and I've seen this elsewhere, you, you, you will put pressure on the people you can
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:42.900]   pressurize and you will not put enough pressure on the people you can't pressurize. And that is
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:51.540]   one of the worrying things that could happen with this. Simply you can put America can put extraordinary
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:05:01.060]   diplomatic, uh, uh, diplomatic financial intelligence, military risk, pressure on Ukraine.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:10.180]   And it can put significant pressure on Putin, but it's much easier to pressure Zelensky.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:16.180]   And that's one of the many things that makes it harder is that the temptation to rush for peace,
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:20.820]   accepting that peace is the most desirable thing, accepting the horrors of war, which,
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:27.860]   you know, we can linger on, but you, you accepting all that. If somebody says, we've got to get peace
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:32.820]   today. And the three of them around a table, the most likely thing is that it'll be that it'll be
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:39.860]   the person who you compression most easily, who will be the person that you pressure. And as a result,
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:46.660]   have an outcome, which yes, might stop the killing as soon as possible, but might also set up a
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:55.220]   situation which rewards the aggressor and effectively punishes the victim. And that's extremely ugly and
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:06:01.940]   common common thing to happen. Yeah. And that's the other boring thing to say. The boring truth that, uh,
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:10.500]   the easy shortcut here is, uh, is to punish Ukraine and you just have to not do it. Let's keep being the
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:18.980]   boring people of the party. Yeah. Well, nobody's going to invite us. All right. Let's go from one
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:29.540]   complicated conflict to, uh, perhaps an even more one complicated one, Israel and Palestine.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:42.180]   Can you, uh, take me through what happened on October 7th, as you understand it. And as you outline
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:47.780]   at the beginning of the book, well, the book on democracies and death cults is a mixture of firsthand
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:56.500]   reporting and observation interviews and a wider reflection, not just on the war that's been going
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:02.740]   on since the seventh of October, but the war's been going on a lot longer. And also I suppose on the,
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:07.300]   what for me is one of the overwhelming questions, which I'm sure we'll get to, which is the reaction
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:16.260]   in the rest of the world. Obviously on the seventh itself, it was a brigade sized attack on Israel from
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:27.220]   Gaza. Uh, Hamas broke through the security fence and, uh, attacked all the softest targets they could.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:36.980]   Uh, they swiftly overwhelmed things like the observation base in Nahal Oz. They ran through the
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:43.860]   communities in the South, uh, uh, very peaceful peace neck effect free communities of the kibbutz sim as
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:53.780]   they're called the communities, um, and murdered and raped and burned and kidnapped. And of course they,
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:58.260]   from their point of view, had the great good fortune of also coming across hundreds of young people
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:05.860]   people dancing in the early hours of the morning at a dance party and rampaged through that with RPGs and
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:15.140]   Kalashnikovs and grenades and hammers and more. And, uh, got within, well, 20 kilometers into Israel
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:24.100]   places like off Akim and sterat important towns and carried out their massacres there as well.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:33.140]   We now know that the plan was that Hezbollah did the same thing from the north. Hezbollah joined in the
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:39.460]   war within 24 hours by starting firing rockets again in very large numbers into Northern Israel from Southern
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:46.500]   Lebanon. But the plan was that they would do the same thing from the north and carry out similar
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:51.060]   massacres there and effectively be able to meet in the middle and garrot Israel from the center.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.580]   The interesting reason why I think it'll be found out in the future, but why they didn't
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:02.180]   coordinate better was Hamas didn't trust any line of communication to Hezbollah to let them know
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.460]   exactly when they were going to do it. That wouldn't be in for it wouldn't be intercepted.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:11.620]   The Iranian revolutionary government in Tehran, which obviously funds Hamas and Hezbollah and
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:19.380]   trains and arms knew of the plan. It was a very successful attempt to annihilate the state, but
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:24.900]   they didn't get close to that, but they got worryingly closer than people might have thought
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:32.020]   they were capable of. I think from the Israeli side, uh, it was obviously one of the most, if not the most
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:36.820]   catastrophic intelligence and military failures since the foundation of the state.
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:45.300]   And I think there are several reasons why one is a perception problem. What a lot of
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:51.620]   military commands and others described to me as the conception, the conception that had prevailed in
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:10:00.420]   Israel for some years and security military establishment was that Hamas were content with being corrupt and
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:10.420]   governing Gaza and, you know, lining their pockets and living in, uh, Qatar and becoming billionaires. But
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:19.780]   that like many other terrorist groups and, you know, cults that they would end up becoming just corrupt and
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:27.620]   not losing their ideology, but the ideology becomes secondary. That's the first thing was there was
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:37.860]   just a massive error of the conception in Israel. And then, then the multiple manifold security and
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:46.340]   military failures of the day and leading up to the day. Um, and there will be a, there already have been
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:50.820]   quite a lot of people held to account for that and they're doubtless will be in the future as well.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:11:00.820]   Um, the, the single, uh, thing I heard, which I heard most and which was most distressing in a way
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:08.420]   was the number of people who described to me, you know, who survived the massacres in the south, who said that,
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:14.100]   you know, you know, they'd said to their children, don't worry, the army will be here in minutes.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:19.780]   And they weren't, you know, in many places, it was many hours till the army got there.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:29.060]   Um, and there are reasons for that. There are some reasons that will be military failings, leadership failings.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:34.820]   Other things were very, I discovered were very human failings.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:41.060]   I don't want to overstress the failure of the army because actually certain units and things
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:46.580]   got down very fast. There was a unit of Devan who got down to the junction, you know, by, within about
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:54.900]   an hour, 90 minutes of the massacres starting and joined in the fight. And then there were self-starters
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:12:00.580]   who I write about in the book, extraordinary people who just like broke orders and just realized the
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:07.940]   magnitude of what was happening and said, we need it in the south, go and fought very hard for hours,
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:15.220]   days, in some cases. But the complexities on the ground were unbelievable. I mean, as, as usually
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:21.940]   happens in warfare, but what they call the fog of war is a very real thing. You, you, you know,
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:28.020]   what it's, you can see it in hindsight, but you can't see when you're in it. And one of the things that
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:37.300]   made it very complicated was for instance, Hamas coming in, uh, taking uniforms off dead Israelis,
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:49.700]   uh, wearing them, uh, coming in with Israeli style, um, apparatus on them. There's a Muslim doctor I
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:56.500]   quote in the book who I interviewed who describes how he was going to his, he's an Israeli Muslim Arab,
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:01.300]   and he was going to, he's a doctor. He was going to his shift at the hospital at 6:30 in the morning.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:08.180]   The rockets start coming in because the rocket started first and then the full invasion. And he
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:13.860]   described to me how, um, you know, he's one of the members of this group, the United Hatsala, which is
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:19.460]   a first responders group. And, um, they sort of, you know, they get an alert and it tells them that,
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:25.540]   you know, a car has crashed nearby and they, they, they put on their, uh, you know, first aid kit and
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:31.380]   so on and go. And he got one of those alerts, one of the junctions and, uh, realized there was a car
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:37.380]   that something had happened and there were some dead bodies and he, he stops and he sees these men dressed
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:43.140]   as soldiers. Uh, and they just start, and he's wearing his Hatsala gear and they start firing at
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:50.340]   him. And he just thinks, what the hell, what the hell is going on? And, uh, they turned out to be Hamas
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:58.660]   dressed as Israeli soldiers. They, uh, used him as a human shield to try to protect from any air assault.
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:04.740]   And, uh, in the end they shot him and left him and he survived. He's a very, very brave man.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:13.860]   Um, so there was a lot of confusion like that. There's a girl whose father, uh, I interviewed,
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:22.020]   she was at the Nova party and, uh, I met him at one of the reunions of the party and the weeks after
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:28.820]   and the reunions of the survivors and the family and so on. And he described how in the last moments
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:33.700]   of his daughter's life, she phoned him on her phone. Like a lot of people, you know, he reassured her
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:39.620]   the army would get there and so on. And, uh, her boyfriend was shot in the head and was lying on
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:44.180]   her lap and she was obviously panicked and they'd managed to get into a car and escape the party.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:49.140]   But they went to, uh, uh, a community where they thought they'd be safe in the south of Israel. And
[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:54.980]   they were told to stay where they were by somebody who she said was a policeman and he wasn't a policeman.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:15:01.220]   He was Hamas dressed as police and, uh, she died as she was shot and killed as well.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:12.980]   And, um, so there was a lot of confusion like that. Uh, it, it, hopefully we're, you know, the world will
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:19.220]   find out exactly what went wrong. Israel will find out exactly what went wrong that led to this catastrophe.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:23.060]   But I mean, it, it, it was a complete catastrophe.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.380]   Do you have a sense of how such an intelligence failure could have happened?
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:33.060]   So there's a bit of a temptation to go into conspiracy land because it's such a giant
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:39.940]   intelligence failure. It seems that there is, um, some manipulation on the inside for political
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:45.540]   reasons or for, you don't need to go into conspiracy land. I mean, I think there are people who say that
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:50.020]   there were parts of the intelligence network and so on that were trying, that were withholding the
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:57.780]   information. I don't know. Again, people will find out, um, there's an awful lot of politics inside
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:05.380]   Israel and, uh, it's, it's, it's hard to know that at this stage. I think that most people are sort of
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:13.460]   still Israeli and not Israeli, including people who are anti Israel, who just believe that, you know,
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:20.420]   Israeli military and particularly intelligence dominance is so, so strong that there must have
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:24.660]   been some kind of conspiracy. Otherwise, how could this have happened? I don't think you need to go
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:31.940]   into that. I think that, I mean, for instance, some of the young women at the observation base
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:38.180]   are on the record. They've said, I've spoken to myself and they, who said that they had been warning
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:44.660]   in the weeks running up the seventh, that they were seeing, uh, maneuvers and training by the border,
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:51.220]   which suggested that Hamas was, was going to do something like this. And, and they say that they
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:56.820]   were ignored. The, you speak to some of the more senior commanders about that. And they say, the thing
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:03.140]   is that this stuff was happening all the time. So it's very hard, it's very hard to know at the moment.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:12.020]   Can you talk through your understanding of who and what Hamas is, its history and, uh, the governing
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.740]   ideology of this group?
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:22.260]   Well, Hamas in a way, quite easy to understand because they, they say what their ambitions are.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:26.900]   They say what their beliefs are. They say it, said it from their governing charter onwards.
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:32.100]   And you also have the advantage with Hamas that they, as it were, in trying to understand them is
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:39.220]   that they, they tend to do what they say and, um, act on what they believe. The primary aim of Hamas
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:46.500]   Hamas is to destroy the state of Israel and then C. They're not an unusual group, sadly. The,
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:50.580]   the bit of it that is hard for some people to understand, I think,
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:57.460]   is that, is that they really do mean what they say and that they really do mean what they say they
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:03.540]   want to do. And I give a number of examples in the book of this, but I mean, the most, uh,
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:13.220]   obvious is the case of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, who is generally regarded as having
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:21.060]   orchestrated and, and, um, arranged the 7th of October. He, uh, we know a fair amount about him
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:31.940]   because he was in prison in Israel in the 2000s for murdering Palestinians in Gaza. And, uh, he was
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:38.820]   released in the prisoner swap for the, he's one of the more than 1,000, uh, Palestinian prisoners
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:44.340]   inside Israel who was released in his, in a swap for Gilad Shalit, the abducted Israeli soldier.
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:55.220]   And, uh, Yahya Sinwar in prison in Israel, um, talked to, among others, a dentist who ended up saving his
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:19:02.580]   life because Yahya Sinwar had a brain tumor. And, uh, this, this dentist identified this and, uh,
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:08.180]   actually sent him to the hospital. And the Israelis famously, uh, removed the tumor and, and, and saved
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:15.380]   Sinwar's life. But this dentist used to speak to him in, in the prison, not fairly regularly and, and has
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:22.820]   related, not least to the New York times, his conversations with Sinwar. And, uh, Sinwar said in
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:29.860]   one of those conversations, he said, you know, he said, uh, uh, at the moment, you Israel are strong.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:34.100]   Um, but one day you'll be weak and then I'll come.
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:38.340]   And, uh, that's, that's what he did.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:48.260]   Is it a hatred of Israel or is it a hatred of Jews? Is it on the level of nations or the level of, uh,
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:48.820]   religion?
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:55.700]   Both. It's both. I mean, it, it originates from a religious mindset, but it's of course, political as
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:03.540]   well. Um, I mean, the Hamas charter, of course, some people sort of think the Hamas charter is of no
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:08.900]   significance. And I often notice this sight of hand that, that, that people do again,
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:13.380]   it goes back to what I was saying earlier. Um, forget everything other than the most important
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:19.300]   basic things, but the Hamas charter, uh, among other things, quotes the hadith that, you know,
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:24.900]   the end times will not come until all of the, the, the, the, the rocks and the trees shout out,
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:33.620]   oh, uh, oh Muslim, there's a Jew behind me, come and kill him. And, uh, that, that is so Hamas is
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:40.980]   both obviously anti-Israeli, obviously, and anti-Jewish, obviously. Um, it's, it's, uh,
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:49.300]   and by the way, I mean, um, one of the many painful stories I tell in the book, but is of
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:54.420]   the fact that so many of the people in the communities that they attacked, it's not as
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.740]   if there'd be a right community to act and a wrong community to attack, but the many of
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:05.060]   the communities they attacked were communities, which deeply, deeply dreamed of the idea of living
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:11.780]   in peace with their Palestinian neighbors. Uh, there's a woman who, whose name has become relatively
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:16.980]   famous since certainly is famous inside Israel, Vivian Silva, who was a peace activist who spent
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:26.580]   every weekend, um, driving Gazan children from, uh, the border to if, if they had very rare medical
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:30.900]   needs that could not be seen attention to within inside Gaza would drive them to Israeli hospitals.
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:36.180]   And she spent every weekend doing that worked for all of the sort of left wing peacenet organizations
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:43.620]   in Israel. And for a while after the seventh, uh, her neighbors and others thought that, uh,
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:48.340]   she had been taken captive into Gaza and that she, there was a hostage poster for her. And there were
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:54.980]   appeals by the various peacenet organizations for Hamas to hand her over, but it turned out she'd been
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:22:00.900]   burned alive in her home. And this wasn't discovered for quite a long time because there was so little DNA
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:09.140]   left of her that it was very hard to identify the remains as being hers. Um, so there were,
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:14.340]   there were a lot of, just a lot of people in the Gaza envelope as it's, it's called in Israel,
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:22.180]   in the area around Gaza, who, who would have been the people who, you know, wanted to live peacefully
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:28.020]   with, uh, the Gazans someday. And those, there's a certain among the many, it's not an irony,
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:36.500]   but just among the sort of pains of the day is that is that so, so overwhelmingly, these,
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:44.420]   these are the people that, that Hamas brought hell to the response to October 7th by Israel.
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:47.300]   Can you steal me on the case that Israel went too far?
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:54.180]   Well, the case that, that started from very early on that, that critics of Israel had was the,
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:23:00.420]   the claim that, I mean, I think I first heard it on about the 8th of October before Israel had done
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:08.820]   anything in response was the claim that, uh, Israel must act proportionately in response. And I,
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:15.700]   I have a critique of this that I've often expressed, which is that there is such a thing as proportionality
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:22.260]   in warfare. Um, and at the same time, Israel is always accused of acting disproportionately.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:29.060]   And the proportionality of the rest of the, much of the rest of the world seems to think Israel should
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:37.620]   express in warfare is to, is to have an equal, um, an equal level of suffering or killing on both sides.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:46.500]   I don't think there's any, um, uh, law of war that says that, you know, if you kill 1200 people and
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:53.140]   you kidnap another 250, that as it were, the other side's allowed to do the same back. But that's what
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:58.900]   a lot of people think. And then when they see the death toll escalating on the Gaza side, they say
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:04.580]   Israel has acted disproportionately and has over reacted.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:12.100]   that one is a, is a, is, is tricky because, you know, it's, it's, it's my belief that, I mean,
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:17.220]   again, this is a basic thing, but it has to be stated that 9 million citizens of Israel,
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:21.700]   if you extrapolate that out to what the 7th of October would have meant in American terms,
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:29.620]   you'd be talking about, uh, a day on which if, if the attack had happened in America,
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:35.940]   where 44,000 Americans were killed in one day and 10,000 American citizens taken hostage,
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:46.420]   nobody can tell me that if such an atrocity occurred that America would not do whatever it
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:52.980]   needed to destroy the groups that had done that and to retrieve the hostages who'd been taken.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:59.300]   So just on that point, I agree with you a hundred percent, America would do, would hit hard back.
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:04.980]   And I think a lot of Americans would feel justified in that, but it's also possible that, uh,
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:12.500]   the military industrial complex and the politicians would do something like the war in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:19.620]   which means extend far beyond hitting back and actually do a thing that's destructive to everybody,
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:25.540]   including America financially and the flourishing of America and the flourishing of humanity broadly
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:34.020]   and the region and the stability and the war on terrorism. Uh, if that's a real thing, uh,
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:41.940]   the war in Iraq and Afghanistan did not maybe succeed in defeating terrorism or even making progress.
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:48.340]   It probably made more terrorists than not. So there's a justified feeling of hitting back and, uh,
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:54.180]   going after somebody like bin Laden in the case of 9/11. And then there's just the actual implementation.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:26:04.340]   Um, and it seems like the implementation can sometimes, um, unintended or unintended have consequences that are
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:11.700]   bordering on war crimes, if not downright war crimes. Now this, this is a general statement. And now we'll
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:22.340]   look at Israel where things are small land. Everything is very compact. There's a lot of complexities that are
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:28.740]   well studied that we've talked about extensively. Well, the two stated aims of the Israelis after the
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:35.300]   seventh were, uh, to get the hostages back and to destroy Hamas. And many people said that you could
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:44.900]   do one, but not both. Um, and, uh, I actually think they've gone a long way to doing both by no means
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:49.860]   everything. There were still hostages as we're speaking, held in Gaza, including a young American.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:57.700]   Um, and Hamas is not completely destroyed. It's very, very significantly degraded, but it's not
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:08.980]   completely destroyed. But those are the two aims. Um, I believe that I mean, I've seen as much of the
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:17.620]   war as any outside observer. I don't know. There might be some exceptions maybe, but, and so I think I can
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:24.100]   say with considerable certainty what the Israelis have and haven't done. Um, the,
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:32.660]   the opera, there were various operations at the beginning, various, uh, plans which didn't happen,
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:38.580]   like storming straight in and getting, for instance, as many hostages as possible out of the Shifa
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:44.660]   complex, which is called a hospital, but also at the very least the Hamas command headquarters.
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:51.700]   And, um, um, there was a, there was a plan to maybe go and, uh, um, do that fast, but it was,
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:57.860]   it was avoided because of the number of deaths on all sides that would be likely to happen.
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:03.780]   The Israelis did actually hold back at the beginning. There was a period of making sure that when they
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:14.260]   went into Gaza, they didn't do so in any way blind, but Gaza is a very built up area and population wise is, is, is, is, um,
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:22.020]   is densely populated something by the way, which the people who, who claim frivolously that Israel has been
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:30.020]   committing genocide never take account of, which is the fact that the garden population has boomed since the Israeli withdrawal in 2005. It's almost double.
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:38.820]   Um, but yes, it's, it's a densely populated area and it's an incredibly difficult place for the train of
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:45.380]   war because of one thing in particular, which is that Hamas goes back a bit to our conversation earlier, but this
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:52.260]   is a much more extreme example. I mean, Hamas really don't play by the rules. In fact, they, they use the rules of
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:58.980]   war, the laws of war completely to their own advantage. You know, it has to be reiterated.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:10.340]   You are not meant to, uh, disguise your army as civilians. You're not meant to use places of, uh,
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:18.020]   care like hospitals as bases for your military operations. You're not meant to use schools
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:27.060]   and places of worship as operating centers of war. And Hamas does all of these things
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:36.020]   and has always done so. And it does so with the very obvious reason that for them, the whole thing is a
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:44.900]   two for one offer. You, you, you get to operate everywhere. And if the Israelis operate anywhere, you claim that
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:53.620]   this is a war crime because how could they attack this group of civilians, these people who are dressed
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:30:02.420]   as civilians, these people merely fighting from a mosque and so on. And that's why, that's why
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:07.620]   everybody who's been to Gaza, who's seen the fighting knows the same thing, which is, this is just
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:17.140]   incredibly difficult, difficult warfare of a kind that, that American troops have seen in the last 20
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:26.180]   years in Fallujah and elsewhere, uh, Kurdish, uh, militia, the Peshmerga saw when they were fighting as our
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:32.740]   frontline troops in the war against ISIS, similar house to house, but by no means with the same entrenched,
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:40.340]   uh, uh, uh, bases. Uh, you know, again, it can't be stressed enough that Hamas has used the years
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:49.380]   since he's ready withdrawal from 2005 to build this vast underground tunnel network. And again, it's obvious,
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:55.700]   but it has to be remembered when is, and I quote one of the Hamas leaders in the book saying this
[01:30:55.700 --> 01:31:01.460]   in an interview, when they build their tunnels, they do so in order that their tunnels are used
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:09.700]   by them Hamas to store their weaponry, to secure their fighters and to hold hostages.
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:16.900]   They do not build their underground tunnel networks for the safety of Gaza and civilians, avoiding aerial
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:27.380]   bombardment. And, you know, the, uh, every difference in the world seems to me to exist between a country
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:36.740]   which does build, uh, bomb shelters for its citizens and, um, a government which builds bomb shelters for its bombs.
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:45.380]   Can you discuss the flow of money here? So how does Hamas, how does Hamas the leadership
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:50.740]   use the money? So you started to talk about the tunnels, but how much corruption is there? Can you
[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:56.340]   just lay it all out? Uh, because I think that's an, that's an important part of the picture here.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:05.700]   It's totally corrupt. Every Hamas leader who's, uh, now dead died a billionaire.
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:17.060]   With a B. With a B. To say that they used Gaza's resources or the, the, the resources that came into
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:24.180]   Gaza for their own ends is to just vastly understate matters. Um,
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:33.700]   Hamas used everything that came in to build the infrastructure of terror that allowed them to do
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:44.580]   the seventh and everything since. Um, they militarized the whole of the Gaza. They, um, by the estimations
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:52.340]   of troops I've been with there, they, every second to third house had weaponry stashed there, bombs,
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:33:03.300]   RPGs, Krasnikov's rockets, tunnel entrances, uh, the network that they just embedded
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:11.060]   all these years was, was total. They, they, they, you know, one of the many, many tragedies of this
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:18.420]   is that whatever you're reading of the rights and wrongs of the Israeli withdrawal in 2005,
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:28.020]   it was an opportunity for the Gaza to become something else. It could have become a thriving
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:33.540]   statelet. It could have been a thriving Palestinian state. It's just that Hamas,
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:42.500]   the PLO before them decided that they wanted to destroy Israel more than they wanted to create
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:49.540]   a Palestinian state. And that is to the great, great detriment of the Palestinians of Gaza,
[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:50.820]   to put it at its mildest.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:57.220]   So just to outline here, leadership of Hamas are stealing the money to get sent by Qatar, by everybody.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:02.660]   So they're putting in their pocket and then the American taxpayer and by the European taxpayer as
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:06.820]   well. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, but I mean, it's not just about the stealing of money. It's,
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:12.500]   it's about using the money and the infrastructure to annihilate your neighbor. I mean, that's those,
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:17.540]   those two things, but the corruption is, uh, a signal from an economic perspective,
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:26.740]   but it's also a signal of deep moral corruption because they're screwing over the Palestinian people.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:31.700]   Yeah. It's a cynicism, certainly. Yeah. Okay. And then with the money they do spend
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:37.140]   on the Palestinian cause, they're not doing that to, uh, build up
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:46.020]   Gaza. They're doing it to, uh, strengthen the militaristic capabilities of the terrorist organization
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:55.620]   of Hamas. You have, maybe you can correct me on this, um, have said that
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:35:03.140]   the people of Gaza have some significant responsibility for the actions of Hamas.
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:07.220]   Yes. Because they've elected them. They elected them. The what ifs are endless, but
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:15.700]   very unwise of the George W. Bush administration to push for elections in Gaza, um, after 05. But
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:26.100]   Hamas were elected and they then 2007 killed the other Palestinian faction that was their main
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:32.180]   challenger, Fatah, uh, killed them, threw them off rooftops, dragged their bodies behind motorbikes
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:39.620]   through the Gaza. And from that point, they had total control. And you know, this is difficult because
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:46.900]   you, you, you can get into the realm of being accused of advocating or in any way, justifying
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:53.060]   collective punishment. Uh, if you talk about this, but it should be born in mind that,
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:36:07.060]   you know, Hamas had effectively 18 years to run the Gaza. And that's, that's the time that it takes from
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:14.900]   the birth of a child to the end of their formal education. And in 18 years, they could have presided
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:26.340]   over and produced a generation of young Gazans who were productive, productive for their people,
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:31.620]   for their society, for their neighbors, for the rest of the world. And they didn't,
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:41.860]   they spent 18 years indoctrinating the children of Gaza into a death cult and into a genocidal hatred,
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:53.220]   which obviously is, was most dangerous to the Israelis, but it was obviously disastrous
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:37:01.380]   for the people of Gaza. And, you know, there is, um, there's just, if you speak to soldiers who were
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:11.620]   there in 2014, when Hamas started a war again, um, one of a set of rounds of war since 2005. If you speak
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:17.060]   to the soldiers who were there in 2014, going house to house, and who were also involved in the war since
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:24.820]   2003, they all say the same thing, which is the marked radicalization of the Gazan population.
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:32.500]   The marked increase in just, I mean, the most, I mean, it's so banal in a way to even cite, you know,
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:39.780]   like the numbers of copies of Mein Kampf in Arabic in an average Gazan household, the protocols of the
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:45.460]   learned elders of Zion. There are so many what ifs and other paths that Hamas could have taken,
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:51.620]   but that was the one they took. They decided to take the path of using their time and power
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:58.980]   to build up their infrastructure, radicalize the population, and encourage them to believe that they
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:05.220]   could destroy the state of Israel. And then on October the 7th, they gave it their best shot.
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:13.380]   And by the way, there is no organized collective punishment of the citizens of Gaza. Collective
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:19.860]   punishment would just be dropping bombs with no purpose across civilian areas, carpet bombing,
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:24.580]   this sort of thing. This is simply not what the IAF and the IDF have done since the 7th.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:34.100]   They have been fighting a house-to-house war against this terrorist group. They do do aerial strikes.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:43.460]   Gaza is very, very badly beaten up as the buildings, I mean, the infrastructure that existed.
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:56.260]   There aren't many buildings standing. But this is not the result of just wild and imprecise bombing by
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:05.140]   the Israelis. It's been extremely concerted. It's extremely difficult. But when people say,
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:08.580]   well, this must be collective punishment, I think that the people who say that,
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:13.540]   simultaneously, that's not true. And also,
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:24.660]   you know, there is not a hostage who's come out, who Donald Trump made this, President Trump made this
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:32.980]   point recently. There is not a hostage who's come out who I've spoken with, who found any Ghazan,
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:43.300]   Palestinian, who expressed even the slightest human kindness to them. If you, if you look at the footage
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:49.380]   from the 7th that Hamas recorded themselves of them taking young Jewish women into Gaza and so on,
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:59.540]   you will notice that the trucks and the motorbikes and so on are not stopped by horrified Ghazan
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:05.540]   the civilians and so on. And the civilians saying, why have you got this Israeli girl whose tendons you've
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:13.940]   cut and why are you bringing her here? It's all celebration. It's all celebration. And it's the same
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:20.420]   with those couple of cases of hostages who managed to escape from the civilian houses they were being held
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:24.340]   in who were immediately returned by the citizens they met.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:32.580]   Yeah, the celebration, I do wonder what percent of the population they represent, but there's something
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:39.380]   really dark. There's several ways to explain the celebration. It could be that there's a deep
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:45.620]   indoctrination where you do legitimately hate Jews. And there also could be a place of just
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:53.940]   deep desperation. And it's a kind of relief that you have to convince yourself that you're
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:57.460]   on the side of fighting for freedom
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:05.060]   in order to justify to yourself that this is the right way to fight out of desperation
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:11.620]   out of extremely harsh conditions. Because the way we're kind of speaking about this with the celebration,
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:21.940]   it's very easy to project a kind of evil on the populace that I just am very hesitant to project,
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.300]   especially on the general populace.
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:27.060]   You don't have to project it onto them. You can just listen to their own words.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:34.900]   I'm sure you've heard one of many audio recordings you hear from the morning, but I'm sure you've heard
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:41.220]   the audio recording of the young man who ends up in one of the communities in the south of Israel and
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:45.220]   calls back home. Have you heard that?
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:54.660]   I quoted it in the first chapter of the book. He calls back home and he says to his father who picks
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:59.460]   up. It's on WhatsApp. I think he's on the phone. He's saying, "Turn onto WhatsApp because I can show
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:06.660]   you." He says, "I've killed 10 Jews with my own hands. O father, your son has killed 10 Jews." And his
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:11.620]   father is saying, "Where are you? Where are you?" He goes, "I want to show you, Dad. I want to show you. I've killed
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:18.180]   Jews with my own hands. Your son." Put mother on the phone. Mother comes on the phone. The brother
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:36.020]   comes on the phone. This is one of many, many stories from the day that suggest something which I would say
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:42.420]   is not just indoctrination, but yes, evil. First of all, those phone calls are somehow
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:51.220]   uniquely horrific. But I've also heard recordings of phone calls made by Ukrainian soldiers to their
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:58.580]   parents and Russian soldiers to their parents. And they have not as intense and not as horrific,
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:06.100]   but they have a similar nature to them. There's an aspect of war where you
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:17.060]   dehumanize the other side in order to fight that war. So we have to remember that that element is
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:20.100]   going to be there in a time of war, in a time of desperation.
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:32.020]   It would be a strange type of simple sort of, I don't know, pride in war to go into an 80-year-old
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:44.580]   woman's house and kill her on her floor and then film her dead body and her body in its final
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:50.260]   moments and send it round to all of that woman's friends on her phone on her Instagram account.
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:44:00.660]   You may have heard different things from me, but I mean, I would be surprised if there were
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:08.260]   even the most vociferous of Russian soldiers phoning back home to Moscow and saying, "Mom, you won't believe
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:17.540]   my luck. I managed to rape and kill this 80-year-old woman." That's quite unusual, even in warfare.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:27.780]   And that's one of the things about Hamas and what I describe as the death cult types,
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:30.660]   which makes them different from other people.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:38.420]   But that's the channeling of evil and hatred and anger in the human spirit, but that doesn't make
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.620]   that person evil.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:40.900]   No, I disagree.
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:43.060]   You commit that once.
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:49.380]   I think that there is such a force as evil in the world, and I think it can descend and it can be used.
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:56.660]   And it's very hard to find a non-theological way to talk about this. But of everything I've seen,
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:06.020]   there are actions that people like Hamas committed on the 7th that cannot be described as anything other
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:14.420]   than evil. The things that happened at the Nova party were especially appalling. I mean, it was all
[01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:19.700]   appalling, but it was especially appalling because, first of all, it's the sort of party which people
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:25.300]   like you and I, or at least you and I when we were younger, might have been at. And so everyone knows
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:34.260]   the world of a dance party in all night, you know, rave in the desert to commune with nature and the
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:41.700]   universe and to take some psychedelics and to, you know, expand your consciousness and your love and
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:52.020]   all of that sort of thing. The fact that people doing that at 6:30 in the morning then encountered
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:46:02.420]   people coming in to the party on trucks and military vehicles and just massacring them and raping them.
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:07.380]   And I mean, I give examples of the first-hand accounts of people who survived, but I mean, it's
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:18.740]   beyond belief of almost anything else I've covered in war. And it's because it seems so...
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:30.180]   I mean, an army facing another army is one thing. A terrorist group in civilian clothing
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:49.380]   facing a group of young people at a dance, unarmed, and doing what they did is pretty hard to comprehend
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:47:00.580]   unless you use the lexicon of evil somewhere. So that stated, can you empathize with the suffering of
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:05.780]   Palestinians in Gaza with the destruction that resulted as a response?
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:14.740]   Yes. What has happened in response is terrible, terrible for the citizens of Gaza. I was there
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:25.620]   on the first time a couple of days early and into the ground invasion when the citizens of Gaza were
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:32.660]   coming south. I was in the middle of the strip and the humanitarian corridor had been set up to try to
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:39.780]   stop the hostages being taken south, deeper into Gaza, and to try to stop Hamaz's leadership from
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:46.900]   making it south. It actually didn't really work because they'd already got a lot of the hostages south.
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:54.260]   It was an attempt to keep Hamaz there and fight them in the north so as not to be dragged all the way in,
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:48:01.220]   in the end, dragged all the way in anyway. But yes, I mean, watching the citizens of Gaza moving
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:08.100]   through the humanitarian corridor and everyone was being checked for bombs, suicide vests,
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:11.380]   checked for particularly young men of military age.
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:21.460]   I mean, you look at this tide of human misery and you think this is terrible, but this is a terrible
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:26.660]   thing that had been brought upon them by the people who had been misgoverning the place
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:36.100]   that they lived in. And of course, on a human level, you feel terrible that these people are going
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:47.220]   through this. At the same time, human empathy for them can coexist beside an unspeakable anger
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:55.940]   that they had come to this point because of the fact that they had elected a terror group to run
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:49:01.300]   their territory. And one of the things obviously is that, you know, a lot of people like to say,
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:07.380]   and it's true of course, that, you know, this didn't all start on October the 7th. Absolutely true.
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:13.620]   And this particular round, this particularly intense round of war started on October the 7th,
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:20.820]   without doubt. Hamas did not have to attack on October the 7th. It wasn't like they were forced to
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:25.460]   liberate themselves or something, as some of the defenders of Hamas claim.
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:35.700]   But the conflict of course goes back a lot earlier, but you will have to always keep on contending with
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:44.500]   this fact that there is one central issue to the paradigm of that conflict, what used to be called
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:50.900]   the Arab-Israeli conflict, and now has become interestingly rebranded the Israeli-Palestinian
[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:57.140]   conflict. But there is one absolutely essential issue to this, which cannot be forgotten, which is
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:06.420]   is, do the Palestinians want a state, or do they want to destroy the Jewish state?
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:14.660]   And if they want to destroy the Jewish state, as they've tried many times, it's a disaster for them.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:22.100]   It's a total disaster for them. If they want to create their own state, they've already had several
[01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:31.220]   very good shots at it, one of which is Gaza post 2005. But they've never shown in their leadership
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:39.860]   the desire to live with a Jewish state. And that's a catastrophe for the Palestinians.
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:46.820]   Can you still imagine the case of the lived experience of Palestinians and pro-Palestinian voices that
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:55.460]   describe the Gaza situation as an occupation? The West Bank too, and in the case of Gaza, open-air prison?
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:51:02.660]   The, to take them in order, there's nothing about Gaza that was an open-air prison.
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:09.620]   They had ability to trade, they had the ability to move in and out in increasing numbers.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:17.780]   Egypt wasn't so keen on allowing Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt, still isn't. But at the time of the
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:22.260]   7th, there was actually an interesting, one of the things the international community was pushing for
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:28.020]   was for more Palestinians to be coming into Israel every day through the Eretz crossing and others to
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:32.100]   work in Israel, because they can make a better living in Israel than they can in Gaza.
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:41.220]   And this, the, as it were, normalization route was slowly being attempted, it was being pushed on
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:46.100]   Israel by the international community a little bit too fast for Israel's comfort, but it happened.
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:54.420]   That completely came to an end, and that dream is done, gone, since the 7th of October.
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:56.340]   Can you clarify the dream, the normalization?
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:57.460]   The normalization dream.
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:58.820]   Between Gaza and Israel.
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:51:59.460]   Israel.
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:51:59.460]   Gone.
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:05.540]   There will be, yeah, no normalization. No, not after that. And one of the reasons is
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:12.420]   the number of people, again, who I've spoken with who employed Palestinians, worked with Palestinians,
[01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:18.180]   worked alongside Palestinians, encouraged more Palestinians to be coming from Gaza in order to
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:21.300]   work in Israel, and these were their brothers and sisters and so on and so forth.
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:26.340]   One of the reasons why the massacres of the 7th were so successful in the Kibbutz Sim,
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:32.980]   the communities in the South, was because of the number of the terrorists who came in with detailed
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:44.260]   house-to-house maps of those communities. I spoke with one man who, his community, they had a security
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:51.060]   officer, chief, and Hamas came in. They knew to go and kill him and his family first, and then which
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:53:00.740]   families. I've seen the maps myself. They came in with incredibly accurate information about these
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:06.260]   communities. How did they have them? Because it was given to them by the brothers, by the workers,
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:12.740]   by the people of Gaza who were coming in and out. So there is nobody that will trust that ever again.
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:17.220]   There's a lot of Palestinians that have lived and flourished inside Israel.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:26.580]   What are they saying? What are they feeling? And what are the Israelis feeling about them? Is there still
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:31.220]   camaraderie to some degree, or is it completely destroyed?
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:41.380]   My observation at the beginning was that everyone was extremely wary. I mean, if you've worked beside
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:48.420]   somebody and then found out they sold out your family, you will never trust again. And that,
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:52.580]   particularly in a small country like Israel, the word of that happening goes out very fast.
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:54:00.100]   The very beginning there was intense, intense fear about that, including of the, you know,
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:09.060]   20% or so of the population who are Arab Israelis. I actually think one of the few sort of positive
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:19.060]   news stories of the period is that that population within Israel has, by and large, held. There hasn't
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:29.140]   been an intifada. One of the reasons why there hasn't been more activity, terrorist activity in
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:33.780]   the West Bank in Judea and Samaria is because the Israelis have been very careful, along with the
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:40.980]   Palestinian Authority, to some extent cooperating to keep that down. But, you know, there wasn't a war on,
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:44.980]   a full war on three fronts, for instance, which was at risk of happening.
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:53.140]   So I think that the sort of coexistence within Israel has pretty much held. There are some
[01:54:53.140 --> 01:55:02.820]   terrible examples, far too regular, but not as regular as it could happen, of Muslim Arab Israelis
[01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:09.300]   carrying out acts of terror in, as it were, sympathy with Hamas. I was in the middle of one such attack
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:19.060]   myself, uh, uh, late last year, um, and, uh, in a town called Hedera. And those things have happened,
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:24.820]   but they, it's, it's not, that, that particular catastrophe has not occurred.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:31.940]   Can we talk about, uh, Benjamin Netanyahu? For a lot of people who spoke of evil,
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:38.260]   they refer to him as evil. On the spectrum between good and evil, as a leader, where does Netanyahu fall?
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:45.620]   Well, he's certainly not evil. Uh, interesting if people, uh, looking at this conflict were to be
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:50.820]   reluctant to use the word evil of Hamas and eager to use it of the Israeli prime minister,
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:55.300]   it would be sort of, uh, telling, I would say. Can we just actually linger on that point?
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:56:02.500]   There is a point you've made, uh, multiple times, which is we're more eager to, to criticize and maybe
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:08.820]   even, uh, over-exaggerate the criticism of democratically elected leaders.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:09.860]   Yes.
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:18.020]   It's a dark, weird, other quality of, uh, discourse at parties, aforementioned parties.
[01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:22.580]   Well, isn't it also, I mean, not to be flippant for a moment, it's a little bit like,
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:29.140]   who do you show your worst sides to? The people you love.
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:38.740]   You, it's like, you know, my intense irritability is something that tends to be felt most by people
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:44.900]   who are closest to me because I, um, um, if I express it to absolutely everybody I met at the
[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:50.180]   party or a social setting, it would be, it'd be hard. I mean, there's a tendency to lean heavily on
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:59.220]   the people who are closest to you, the people who will put up with it. Um, and something similar
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:06.740]   happens in international politics. You, you pressure the people who will listen. I mean, it's, it's one
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:12.100]   of the, I mean, one of the things you hear a lot in the last years, you know, people sort of ignoramuses
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:18.260]   in the governments in places like Britain, you know, will say we need to put more pressure on the
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:28.420]   Israelis to do X. And you go, well, you know, in part, that's because they will listen. If you go,
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:34.420]   we need to put more pressure on the Ayatollahs in Iran to, to persuade them that Hamas are really bad
[01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:38.580]   and they shouldn't be doing this. Right. What the hell do you think they're going to do? They're
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:43.780]   going to listen to you. They're going to give a damn. You're talking totally different worlds,
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.460]   not just a different language, it's a different world. And by the way, that happens in Israel.
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:53.220]   I mentioned it earlier, but it happens in Israel. When the hostage families forum
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:57.700]   came about, uh, I spent a lot of time there, a lot, got to know a lot of the families and, um,
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:02.100]   they're remarkable. But one of the things you did notice from them as well was that
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:10.660]   a lot of them, oh, they protest outside Netanyahu's house. They use klaxon horns and make sure he doesn't
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:16.820]   can never sleep. They, uh, will, you know, put up great big posters by his house of him with bloodied
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:25.620]   hands and, and so on. And I have, you know, I think as much sympathy as you can for these families,
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:35.220]   the plight of knowing that your child is sitting in a tunnel in Gaza for a year, a day, an hour is
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:46.820]   intolerable, but there's a reason why the families protested Netanyahu. And that's because Sinhua didn't
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:57.460]   care. That wouldn't work. If you said, are you, you know, understand my plight? I'm a Jewish mother
[01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:05.700]   and my daughter is thing. You think Sinhua and the heads of Hamas care? You think the leaders in Qatar
[01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:15.780]   who host them care? The Qatari Amir's mother, when Sinhua was killed, praised Sinhua. You couldn't talk
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:20.420]   that language to these people, but you can talk that language to the elected prime minister of Israel
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:27.860]   because that, first of all, he's somebody who might listen to your pressure, could be pressured.
[01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:32.980]   And secondly, it's simply the only person you can pressure. There's no one else. Hamas doesn't care.
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:36.660]   Hezbollah doesn't care. The Iranian revolutionary government doesn't care.
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:43.860]   Yeah. So let's just sort of say once again, the, uh, the obvious thing that, uh, what, while it is
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:53.220]   possible to discuss, uh, Hamas, uh, soldiers as freedom fighters, I'm not one of the folks that
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:57.620]   can take that perspective. It's a tough one to take. I don't see how you can call them freedom fighters.
[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:02.980]   So this goes to the man from the land of peace and the man from the land of war.
[02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:09.220]   There is a lived experience of what it means to grow up in Gaza. And if you fully load that into your brain
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:17.700]   in a, uh, in a real way, not in, not using the words of good and evil, but in a, in a very deep human sense,
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:24.180]   from that place, from that place of desperation, from your home and your family's destroyed,
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:30.820]   doesn't matter why, doesn't matter if there's evil all around you that caused it, doesn't matter. The, the facts are the facts.
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:39.540]   And from that place, somebody who's fighting for you can feel like a freedom fighter.
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:45.380]   I think it should be called out that, yes, it can feel that way from the lived experience.
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:52.660]   But Hamas is very clearly, since we're talking about Netanyahu, Hamas is evil.
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:01:02.100]   Okay. Now you can still, in that context, discuss the degree to which Netanyahu is the right leader for
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:11.140]   this moment. And whether he goes too far, whether he's too politically selfish in the decisions he makes,
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:19.700]   whether he's too much a warmonger, whether he's utilizing the war, uh, for his own political gains,
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:28.980]   and is, uh, not caring about the death of civilians in Gaza, for example, but more caring about his own
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:35.700]   political, uh, maintaining power. That's a perspective that I could steal, man. And that's a perspective
[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:40.980]   worth discussing. And that's the perspective many in Israel hold when they criticize Netanyahu. He's
[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:46.020]   increasingly less and less popular. That's wrong. The opinion polls last month when he was in Washington,
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:51.220]   showed him at an all time high, you know, but you were saying I, I make my own poll. And according to my poll,
[02:01:51.220 --> 02:01:56.420]   um, I'm the greatest, I'm the nicest and the coolest person in the world.
[02:01:56.420 --> 02:02:01.460]   A hundred percent of people agree. So I didn't mean to laugh that much. Yeah.
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:05.300]   You laughed a little too much. It's more than the joke. Yeah.
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:10.020]   But you were saying, I mean, yeah. Okay. Let's steal, man, the criticism of Netanyahu.
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:15.940]   Can you, and then steal, man, the case for him that he's the right leader actually at this moment.
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:22.660]   The most devastating thing that anyone can come up against Netanyahu is, is, uh, that the seventh
[02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:32.340]   happened on his watch. Um, after the Yom Kippur war in 1973, Golda Meir, who is a very distinguished
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:38.420]   prime minister of Israel and a remarkable woman, but she effectively took the, the political hit
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:47.780]   for the Yom Kippur invasion, um, by Israel's Arab neighbors happening on her watch. And, um, and I
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:55.060]   thought that most critics, fair-minded critics of Netanyahu inside Israel and without would always hold
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:03:05.940]   that against him. Um, the, uh, I suppose that the, one of the criticisms you hear a lot as well is this
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:10.420]   thing of Israel being divided in the year before the seventh because of the judicial reforms.
[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:18.460]   Um, I think there's a strong case with judicial reforms in Israel, but, um, it's a sort of niche
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:23.880]   Israeli governance issue, which we don't have to get into. The point is, is that Netanyahu and his
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:31.260]   government were pushing these reforms through judicial reforms. And, uh, it was very divisive and on the
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:39.100]   streets of Tel Aviv and other cities every weekend, there were protests and the, uh, police were tired
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:44.540]   because they'd spent week after week on overtime policing these protests, which often turned
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:53.020]   raucous, not to say violent, but sometimes violent. And, uh, you could say, well, if you see that something
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:59.500]   is dividing your country this much, why don't you stop? There is a claim by some people that one, one of
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:06.220]   the things that prompted the seventh was that Hamas and his backers in Qatar and Iran saw the division
[02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:12.780]   in Israeli society, saw the Israeli population, you know, a significant chunk of it every week on the streets,
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:19.340]   shutting down highways, shutting down services and so on, and thought good. Now's the time. In other words,
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:26.940]   what I quoted Sinwar as saying earlier, when he was in, um, in a prison in Israel was, you know, this thing,
[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:35.820]   one day you'll be weak and then I'll strike. Maybe that is one of the things that Sinwar thought Israel
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:40.300]   was very weak. It had been divided and therefore the time strike. There's an argument against that,
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:46.780]   which is that the seventh was in preparation and being planned before the judicial reform process
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:53.820]   in Israel began. So you can look at it several ways, but you could use that. You could say, look,
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:59.100]   this is, you know, if you, if your, your, your nation was divided, don't push through anymore on that.
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:04.220]   There's, there's lots of things like that. You could say that, that Netanyahu was one of the people
[02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:09.900]   responsible for the conception. You could, uh, there are critics of his, including critics who are in the
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:17.500]   war cabinet who thought that he was too focused on, on, uh, Hamas and not focused enough on Hezbollah.
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:22.620]   Other people think he was too focused on Hezbollah and not enough on Hamas. Um,
[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:30.140]   so I, there's them and many other criticisms that people make of him. I would say I've interviewed,
[02:05:30.140 --> 02:05:37.340]   I think every political leader in Israel from right to left pretty much. And, um, I have to say, I don't
[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:43.580]   think there's any of them that wouldn't have responded similarly to the seventh of October to the way he
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:51.180]   has. Can we, okay. So that's inside Israel, outside of Israel, you know, uh, despite what
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:56.860]   he said, uh, he is one of the most hated people in the world, just the raw quantity relative.
[02:05:56.860 --> 02:06:03.260]   He's loved by a lot of people, but there's a lot of people that, you know, there's a lot of psychological
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:07.820]   effects that might explain that. I mean, it's sort of strange to, to, to, if, if, if, if there is a
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:13.740]   widespread global loathing of the prime minister of a country of eight to nine million people.
[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:19.980]   Yeah. That's, that might mean something more than, uh, a hatred of the, the military actions
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:24.940]   and the policies of the one person. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's a, there's an awful lot
[02:06:24.940 --> 02:06:30.060]   of people to hate in the world. There's a lot of wars in the world. It's, it's always of interest to me.
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:34.700]   And obviously it's on the one things I go into on, on democracies and death cults is this question of
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:42.700]   like, why is this so galvanizing for so many people? And I think that is a very, very interesting
[02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:50.060]   question. Like why, by the way, let me do a quick addendum to that. You can notice something else like
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:56.620]   that. When people talk about the Republican failures in foreign policy in the last 30 years or so,
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:02.860]   it's very interesting. There's a certain type of person who will immediately mention Paul Wolfowitz.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:13.580]   Yeah. Um, and they all say, well, you know, Wolfowitz, you mean deputy under secretary of defense
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:25.260]   under George W. Bush, you think he guided everything. Why would that be other than the fact that his name,
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:29.660]   as Mark Stein once said, starts with a nasty animal and ends Jewish?
[02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:41.740]   I mean, I do. And I do. So I do think that the, there are very deep things at play.
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:54.460]   Netanyahu, irrespective of anything he does for a lot of people is a kind of devil. And you have to say,
[02:07:54.460 --> 02:08:00.140]   well, why is that now? Of course, some people will say, well, that's because he, uh, uh, his terrible
[02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:08.540]   hawkishness and his actions and so on and so forth. The case for Netanyahu is that he sees it as his
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:16.300]   his historic purpose to defend the only homeland of the Jewish people and that that's his life's mission.
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:29.180]   And on that basis, I think he's been by any measure, historic leader. He has warned the world
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:37.260]   about the threat from the mullahs in Tehran. He warned about Iranian revolutionary expansionism
[02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:45.980]   across the region, across the region, across Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen. And after the seventh, he has
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:55.340]   held together a very, very difficult set of challenges to keep, um, international pressure
[02:08:55.340 --> 02:09:05.340]   at the tolerable level to do all sorts of things. But most importantly, to oversee the two war aims
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:12.540]   that he set out at the beginning, I thought, let me just express this. I thought like a lot of people,
[02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:19.820]   when I heard about the hostages, my immediate instinct was they're all dead. They're all going to be dead.
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:24.940]   We'll never see them again. And that was the attitude of a lot of Israelis.
[02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:32.540]   But although there are still hostages being held, and as I've always said, the war could end tomorrow
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:38.300]   if they were handed back. Um, or at least the beginning of the end of the war could begin tomorrow
[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:46.300]   if they were handed back. Uh, nevertheless, because of the actions of not just Netanyahu, but the Israeli
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:56.700]   government, um, most of the hostages have been returned, did not expect this to happen.
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:05.180]   And Hamas has not been completely destroyed, but it has been very, very significantly degraded.
[02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:11.900]   And you end up in the definition of what a total destruction of Hamas would look like, but they
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:20.140]   are not anywhere near the capability they were in November of 2023.
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:29.740]   their leadership has almost all been killed. Uh, the second tier of leadership, almost all gone.
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:37.820]   And, um, this is a just response to what Hamas did.
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:47.660]   The moment, Netanyahu's reputation in Israel was a little low early on because of what had happened.
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:53.820]   But, and there's no doubt. And as I, I say in the final chapter of the book, I mean, there's
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:59.980]   General Slim had this phrase, uh, you know, from defeat into victory, Israel isn't at victory yet
[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:08.540]   in this conflict. But, uh, when in September last year, there were a set of operational successes,
[02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:16.780]   so extraordinary that, I mean, it was just like every day's news was, there was one day I remember when
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:22.460]   after the, um, after the, um, after the Assad regime fell, when, um, the Israeli air force took out the
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:28.780]   entirety of the Syrian air force, uh, in a day because they didn't want it falling into the hands of
[02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:35.500]   the new jihadist administration in Syria. It was story number four on the BBC news website. Um,
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:45.260]   the leadership of Hezbollah, gone, gone. The, the, the second and third tiers of Hezbollah,
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:57.980]   gone or wounded, uh, Iran's Rolls Royce destroyed. Um, these are very, very significant military
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:09.740]   achievements and are in my mind a just response to the attempts by Hezbollah, Hamas and other Iranian
[02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:16.860]   proxies to destroy the Jewish state. Um, would another Israeli leader have been able to hold
[02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:26.140]   firm as Netanyahu has? I don't know, but I do know that any of them would have done something similar
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:31.100]   or would have tried to do something similar because there's no country on earth, no democracy on earth,
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:35.340]   which could possibly not respond to such an atrocity.
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:46.540]   to the point, the underlying point you made of why do so many people want to call him evil?
[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:54.060]   And so the implication is it's not just a hatred of Israel. There's an ocean of hatred for the Jews.
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:59.980]   Yes. Why is there so much hatred for Jews in the world?
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:05.340]   I would say there's one reason in particular. It's a stupid and gullible person's easy answer.
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:18.700]   Why is, why do certain things happen in the world? What is, what is our explanation of chance or unfairness or
[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:21.740]   any number of things?
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:29.660]   Easiest, easiest, stupidest person's explanation is there's a small group of people doing it.
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:35.500]   Let's not say stupidest, because there's something in the human mind that craves a nice,
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:39.900]   clean theory of everything, right? That explains all the problems. It's not just stupidest.
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:42.460]   Let me rewrite it. Lowest grade.
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:46.780]   Right, because I have that desire, too, to simplify everything.
[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:48.380]   Be a bit anti-Semitic, what?
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:56.700]   We've all been very anti-Semitic here and there. Just get a few vodkas. I mean, no.
[02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:02.940]   To find, I mean, maybe as a mathematician in me, to find a simple explanation for everything.
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:03.500]   Right.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:05.500]   Actually, that's nice for everything.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:06.220]   Yeah, yeah, no, no.
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:07.260]   Historians do this.
[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:08.220]   Absolutely. I agree.
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:14.540]   Like, analyzing why the Roman Empire collapsed. It's so nice to have one, especially if it's a
[02:14:14.540 --> 02:14:19.900]   counterintuitive explanation. It's one of the favorite go-tos, right? It's an explanation for all
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:20.860]   the problems in the world.
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.620]   Yeah. It's the lowest resolution analysis imaginable.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:29.900]   Why is there traffic? Why did my wife leave me? Why did my wife cheating on me? Why did I lose my
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:33.820]   job? Why did I not get the job? Because so, even on the personal level-
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:39.260]   Oh, especially on the personal level. Why did I not get everything? Somebody must have held me back.
[02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:46.220]   Yeah. And it's just that hatred of Jews has been such a popular go-to throughout history,
[02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:52.380]   you just always return back to the hits, I guess. And what is it special about the Jews as a group
[02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:55.580]   that people love to hate? Is it just because it's a small number of people?
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:15:03.660]   I think several things. One is successful. One is small and, without by any means saying this is a
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:10.940]   general rule, but disproportionately highly accomplished in certain fields at certain times.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:21.420]   prominent is a word I would use. Prominent slightly beyond their numbers in certain places. It's not
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:26.540]   a full explanation. I mean, you know, all sorts of historical reasons why Jews were involved in
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:32.460]   banking. But then there are lots of historic reasons why the Scottish people, my own, were involved in
[02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:39.260]   banking. And to this day, you don't find many people who blame all international finance problems on the
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:45.100]   Scots. So there are just like easy grooves for people to fall into, it seems to me.
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:50.060]   We should also mention, you know, banking for some reason. Money is a thing that people go to,
[02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:54.620]   but Jews have been disproportionately successful in the sciences and
[02:15:54.620 --> 02:15:59.100]   engineering, mathematics, and the arts, and so on.
[02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:03.100]   A sensible person would try to work out why that is and see what is replicable.
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:11.740]   I don't want to use the word stupid again now, a different type of person.
[02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:13.020]   I'm triggered already.
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:17.340]   A different type of person would look at that and say, "That must mean they took something from me."
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:26.780]   And that's, you know, the most zero-sum game there is. It's an endlessly fascinating subject,
[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:30.140]   because it seems to me that antisemitism is almost certainly a sort of ineradicable
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:34.940]   temptation of the human
[02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:38.700]   spirit at its ugliest and cheapest.
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:48.620]   But because it's back in our day, it bears some analysis again.
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:58.380]   And I would say two things about it. One is, as I and others have said many times in the past,
[02:16:58.380 --> 02:17:04.060]   one of the fascinating things about antisemitism is that it can cover everything at once.
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:13.100]   So the Jews get hated for being rich and for being poor, both for being the Rothschilds and for
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:23.500]   being Eastern European Jews escaping the pogroms. They can be hated for being religious and for being
[02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:29.580]   anti-religious and producing Marxism, for instance. Hated for religiosity and secularism.
[02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:39.740]   They can be hated for most recently not having a state and therefore being rootless cosmopolitans.
[02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:43.260]   And also hated for having a state.
[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:51.580]   And that makes it something very unusual, actually, in the history of human bigotry and
[02:17:52.220 --> 02:18:02.540]   bias and ugliness. But the real thing is, one of my great heroes, Vasily Grossman says at the center
[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:08.140]   of life and fate, almost everything that is worth saying about antisemitism is Grossman's genius,
[02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:15.340]   that he could say in three to four pages what most people couldn't say in an entire life,
[02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:22.140]   even after a life of study. But there's this passage in Life and Fate that I quote in my book,
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:27.580]   which just bowled me over when I read it some years ago. When he says, you know,
[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:34.380]   the interesting thing about antisemitism, he says you can meet it everywhere in the Academy of Sciences
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:41.180]   and in the games that children play in the yard. But Grossman's great insight is, he says,
[02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:48.060]   everywhere it tells you not about the Jews, but about the person making the claim. And the most
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:55.900]   important gift he gives in his analysis is when he describes it as a mirror to the person who is making
[02:18:55.900 --> 02:19:03.020]   the claims, culminating in this phrase I've been trying to make popular, which is he says, "Tell me what
[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:10.060]   you accuse the Jews of, I'll tell you what you're guilty of." It's a searingly brilliant insight.
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:20.380]   the Iranian revolutionary government accuses Israel of being a colonial power.
[02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:28.940]   The Iranian revolutionary government has been colonizing the Middle East throughout our lifetimes.
[02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:39.180]   The Turkish government accuses the Jewish state of being guilty of occupation.
[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:49.260]   Do you know Northern Cyprus? The Turks have been occupying half of Cyprus since the 1970s.
[02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:54.220]   Cyprus is an EU member state and Turkey is in NATO.
[02:19:54.220 --> 02:20:04.540]   So, you can do this on and on. The people who accuse the Jewish state, like the people who accuse Jews
[02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:14.300]   of something, almost without fail, is the thing they're guilty of. Look at the supporters of Hamas and
[02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:21.180]   Hamas. One of the things they say is that Israel is guilty of indiscriminate killing.
[02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:32.380]   Hamas? Hello? What were you doing on the 7th? You see, there are these crazy guys online
[02:20:32.380 --> 02:20:41.260]   who claim, repeatedly claim, that for some reason, Israeli soldiers will rape Palestinians when they meet
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:48.700]   them, whether in a prison or on the battlefield or in a hospital. It just erupts occasionally. These
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:55.500]   people go around and say, "Oh my God, the IDF are rapists." You go, "Excuse me?
[02:20:55.500 --> 02:21:07.500]   You're the ones who spent the years after 2016 saying, 'Believe all women.' Then from the 7th of October said,
[02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:12.220]   'Believe all women, except for Jewish women who say they've been raped or seen their friends raped."
[02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:19.900]   And then you say, "Aha, the Jews are rapists." You've been carrying water for rapists and then go
[02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:27.340]   and accuse the Jews of rape. I mean, it just works. Every way you do it, it works. I do think the thing
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:36.540]   of psychological projection in the case of Israel is wild. I mean, it is wild. By the way,
[02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:41.660]   there's an interesting thing on this that I try to get into in the book, which is this thing of,
[02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:45.900]   "Why did so much of the world respond the way it did?" I mean, we're sitting in New York. There was
[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:54.060]   not one protest against Hamas in New York after the 7th of October. The "Believe all women" crowd
[02:21:54.060 --> 02:22:01.180]   didn't come out against Hamas' rapes. The Black Lives Matter movement did not turn their attention to
[02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:09.100]   the killing of Israeli children or anything. Nobody did it. Nobody did it. The one thing
[02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:15.340]   that did happen very prominently was that people came out to attack the people who'd been attacked.
[02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:19.980]   And as I say in the opening of the book, I saw that myself down the road from here in Times Square on
[02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:27.500]   October the 8th, October the frigging 8th, the protests are in Times Square against Israel justifying the
[02:22:27.500 --> 02:22:35.260]   attacks that were still going on. And this is something that deserves deep self-examination on
[02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:41.340]   behalf of people in the West who've seen this movement overwhelm parts of our society. I mean,
[02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:47.980]   degraded parts but parts, bits of the universities and so on. And I think there's an explanation
[02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:53.820]   for it, by the way, which again goes back to that issue of projection. When you and I last talked on
[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:58.300]   camera, we were talking about my last book, The War on the West, and I remember saying to you there that
[02:22:58.300 --> 02:23:08.700]   one of the things I was talking about in that book was the deeply, deeply, wildly biased, unfair,
[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:16.380]   and inaccurate estimation of the Western past. Whereby, you know, America's original sin had to
[02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:22.220]   be identified and the original sin is slavery. So America has an original sin. Does Ghana have an
[02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:29.180]   original sin? No one knows. No one really would think it polite to point one out. And, you know,
[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:36.060]   you go on and on with these things that I identified in the war on the West, these sins of the West,
[02:23:36.700 --> 02:23:43.980]   and they have in recent years been reduced to the claim that countries like the one we're sitting
[02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:54.940]   in are guilty of what? Colonialism, settler colonialism, white supremacy, slavery, genocide,
[02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:58.620]   and a couple of others you can throw in probably.
[02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:07.980]   One of the things I remember saying to you when we spoke about that was that one of the deep problems
[02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:13.500]   of setting up that system of thought, pseudo-thought, non-thought, would-be thought,
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:20.380]   is that there's nothing you can do about it. Even if it was true, there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:29.340]   If it turned out that your ancestors in the 18th century once owned a slave, what are you going to
[02:24:29.340 --> 02:24:35.980]   do? There's no mechanism to forgive or be forgiven because you didn't do it, and there's no one in
[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:41.500]   life who could accept the apology. And I remember setting it up there in the war on the West. I set up
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:52.300]   this very, very risky, dangerous, unforgivable, unforgiving thing that had been set up about our
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:25:02.300]   societies. But I would say that since October the 7th, there has been an answer for a certain type of
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:11.020]   person, which is, I am from a society where I have been told I am guilty of settler colonialism, white
[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:20.140]   supremacy, genocide, ethnic cleansing, and more. I've been told all of these things. I have been put in an
[02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:30.860]   un-get-outable of situation of moral burden that can never be relieved because I can't ask anyone's
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:43.180]   forgiveness and nobody can forgive me. But ah, here's a country which I can accuse of all of these things
[02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:55.580]   in the here and now. Load my energies, my guilts, my burdens onto, and what's more, I might be able to
[02:25:55.580 --> 02:26:08.300]   end it, and by doing so would relieve myself. And in other words, I tweak Grossman with the people in
[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:12.860]   America and elsewhere who've fallen into this trap. I tweak him by saying,
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:21.260]   "On this occasion, tell me what you accuse the Jews of, and I'll tell you what you've been told you're guilty of."
[02:26:21.260 --> 02:26:27.820]   Yeah, it's an interesting kind of projection. Just to observe some of the
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:36.700]   sociological phenomena here on top of all this, it does seem that hatred of Jews gets a lot of
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:45.580]   engagement online. Is this, so I watch it like a curiosity, like I'm an alien observing Earth.
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:53.260]   Is this dangerous to you, or is it just a bunch of trolls and grifters, you know,
[02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:59.340]   let's say, cosplaying as Nazis? It's just fun to trigger the libs.
[02:26:59.340 --> 02:27:08.140]   It could be all of those things. I think it is, and a lot more. I mean, taboos, you know,
[02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:13.180]   taboos can be fun to break, I suppose. And I suppose there are some people online
[02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:20.940]   who have grown up knowing that, you know, since the Holocaust, anti-Semitism was taboo,
[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:26.780]   and they've run out of, it goes back to what we were saying earlier a bit, you know,
[02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:33.500]   the, they sort of run out of, they've got bored of that, you know, Holocaust, schmolocaust, they'd say,
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:42.220]   you know, I've heard enough about that. And maybe those people have gone off in a funny direction
[02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:48.140]   as a result. But I don't think that's the main, I think that's like a detail compared to the real
[02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:54.860]   thing. The real thing is that anti-Semitism is back. And there is a certain type of person who's
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:55.740]   loving it.
[02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:57.820]   Is it really back? So I watch a lot.
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:03.100]   Well, it never goes away. It's just that, it's just that it's, it's, it's, it's since the seventh,
[02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:07.660]   I think that it's had a great resurgence. And this isn't to say, and I'm just a steel man,
[02:28:07.660 --> 02:28:12.300]   that doesn't mean that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic. No, it doesn't.
[02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:20.380]   But as I have often said, if you don't ever express any interest in the murder of Muslims
[02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:29.420]   in Syria, not any interest in genocide in Sudan, killing of hundreds of thousands of people in Yemen,
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:33.500]   but on the 8th of October, you're on the street with a placard attacking Israel.
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:37.260]   I'm sorry, you're an anti-Semite, for sure. You may not know you are,
[02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:39.500]   but that's what's motivating you.
[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:41.340]   It gets a lot of engagement.
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:42.300]   I watch it.
[02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:42.700]   It does.
[02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:43.500]   I watch it.
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:49.420]   But I mean, it's, it's one of several things you can always see get huge engagement. I mean,
[02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:53.900]   it's like, if you, if you say that there's like a massive pedophile ring run by prominent
[02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:59.820]   politicians, it might be total horse shit. It's likely to be total horse shit, but it'll
[02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:01.180]   also get a hell of a lot of engagement.
[02:29:01.900 --> 02:29:06.540]   Yeah. But that's still the, so the pedophile ring, like Epstein Island, that kind of stuff.
[02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:08.060]   Yeah. Which is very interesting.
[02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:12.460]   Yeah. And it's like, great. All right, cool. Let's, let's get behind that conspiracy.
[02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:20.700]   Uh, but the Jews thing, the hatred of Jews is still, that's the greatest hits still.
[02:29:20.700 --> 02:29:25.420]   It is. And I mean, you see it with, I mean, some of the people who've made minor celebrities of
[02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:33.500]   themselves with a sort of made up version of history with a smattering of this and a little
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:39.500]   bit of that. And then the just asking questions and, you know, I'm not saying, but, and all,
[02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:45.660]   there's certain, you know, rhetorical sites of hand that have, have helped this along. But as I said
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:52.060]   earlier, it's just a, the, the lowest grade explanation of a certain type of mind looking
[02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:59.500]   for a pattern and looking for meaning. And I mean, I can give you just one quick example of why that in
[02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:07.740]   the case of Israel is so extraordinary is the number of otherwise semi-intelligent people who will tell you
[02:30:08.620 --> 02:30:17.500]   that the problem is simply that the Israelis need to give the Palestinians another state
[02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:26.460]   and that if they do, it will solve the problems of the region and the wider world.
[02:30:26.460 --> 02:30:32.620]   And irrespective of the fact that the Palestinians have been given to several states,
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:47.260]   the claim that this particular land dispute would unlock every other injustice in the world should be
[02:30:47.260 --> 02:30:55.740]   seen on its face to be preposterous. There is no reason why if the Palestinians got another state,
[02:30:55.740 --> 02:31:04.060]   either in Gaza or in parts of Judea and Samaria, the West Bank, there is no reason why we should expect the
[02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:15.180]   economy of Yemen to boom. It would not inevitably lead to the mullahs in Tehran giving equal rights to women
[02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:25.340]   or anything else. It, it, it would solve the, the most likely thing is you simply have another failed
[02:31:25.340 --> 02:31:31.980]   Arab state run by a sort of proxy of Tehran. That's the best case scenario. And by the way, even lifelong
[02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:37.420]   defenders of the Palestinian cause, like Salman Rushdie, he said recently, he said, he said,
[02:31:37.420 --> 02:31:42.620]   I've always been a supporter of the Palestinian people and their cause, but it is an unavoidable fact
[02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:47.580]   that if another state was given to the Palestinians, it would simply be at best another front for the
[02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:55.740]   Iranian regime in Iran, the best. So why the passion about the, why the unbelievable wild passion about
[02:31:55.740 --> 02:32:04.140]   this? Why the, and, and I say some of it can be, should be argued out and so on. And some of it can
[02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:11.020]   be explained, but, but there's definitely a realm of it, a layer of it, which is simply at that level of
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:16.940]   this excites something within me. This excites something within me.
[02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:21.340]   Yeah. There's some, there's some, there's something compelling to people about hating Jews.
[02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:26.620]   Look at the, look at the prominence of, of, or, you know, semi-prominent people who are willing to play
[02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:33.260]   around with the idea that 9/11 was an inside job and somehow it's done by the Israelis or the Jews.
[02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:38.220]   I mean, I mean, look at the, like this, this shit is going around.
[02:32:38.220 --> 02:32:42.780]   I have to admit, you know, I'm, I, there's a part of my brain that's pulled towards conspiracies.
[02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:49.820]   There's something compelling and fun about a simple explanation for things, what's really going on
[02:32:49.820 --> 02:32:55.100]   behind the scenes. Because the real world, when you don't look at the conspiracies, first of all,
[02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:58.620]   it's complicated. And second of all, it's kind of boring. It's a bunch of incompetent people.
[02:32:58.620 --> 02:33:02.140]   Usually opening up Pandora's boxes. They don't understand.
[02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:09.580]   Yeah. It's pushing buffoons. And I've been, uh, I mean, I've, I've, uh, walked around and hung
[02:33:09.580 --> 02:33:14.140]   around with a lot of powerful and rich people. And like, the thing I learned is they're just human
[02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:23.500]   beings. There's not, I'm yet to be in a room where exceptionally brilliant psychopaths are plotting.
[02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:27.340]   You never got that invite?
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:32.300]   No. In fact, like a lot of people in the positions of power, they're just not good.
[02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:37.660]   I mean, I'm just continuously disappointed that they're not ultra, I love competence.
[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:45.820]   The places where I've seen competence, inklings of it is in a low level, like soldiers, like low level,
[02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:50.220]   uh, what do you call that? People that do stuff with their hands. So, uh, builders of different
[02:33:50.220 --> 02:33:53.420]   kinds, like engineering, like craftsmen, like I've seen.
[02:33:53.420 --> 02:33:55.920]   Yes. Because you've got, because you've got a very specific,
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:01.120]   task that could be highly complicated, but you get to apply yourself to, and to solve.
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:06.080]   Yeah. Over years, you've mastered it. It's passed across generations and so on,
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:09.440]   but like States craft and like that, that kind of stuff.
[02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:14.000]   Well, it's because there's so many variables. I mean, this is, this is one of the reasons when
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:20.160]   you were trying to lure me on to prognostications on Ukraine. And I was saying, I just, I've seen enough
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:24.320]   to know that I just don't know because I know the amount of things that can change all the time.
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:33.520]   I was, some years ago, I was talking to a former public servant in the UK when, um, uh, uh, Boris
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:38.880]   Johnson was prime minister and COVID started. And I mentioned to this friend, I said, well, you know,
[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:44.800]   it's, it's, it's pretty bad luck for Boris that, you know, he came in to do one thing,
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:51.760]   which was Brexit. And then there's a global pandemic from Wuhan, you know, and he's got to like mug up on
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:58.000]   that and then gets it really wrong. But anyway, and I was really struck by the fact that this man,
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:04.240]   a matter of great insider happened to disagree politically, but said to me, but Douglas is always
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:13.520]   like this. And he said, you know, I mean, look at Tony Blair came into power in 1997, wanting to reform
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:22.640]   education in the UK, ends up trying to remake the Middle East. And I, I do. I mean, as I say,
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:29.040]   one of the reasons why I am scornful of conspiracy theorists and most conspiracy theories, not to say
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:32.960]   that there aren't some that do actually turn out to be, you know, to have something in them.
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:37.040]   And that happens. A lot of things are called conspiracy theories that turn out to be true.
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:46.880]   Lab league. Um, but, but in general, the, the suspicion and the scorn I have for people who fall
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:52.560]   into this is, as I say, it's a very low grade, low resolution. Look at the world where people
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:36:02.880]   clearly have never seen the wildness of actions in the world and the way that they reverberate and
[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:10.400]   the number of events. I mean, I once spoke some years ago to a politician who literally said to me,
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:17.760]   I won't name the country, but said to me, can you help us out with, with just how to cope on the,
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:25.040]   about with the date and understand the day to day struggle we're having with the cycle?
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:28.080]   And I said, well, right, what are you talking about? And they said,
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:35.520]   our experience in government is that every day, something comes up, which we have to firefight.
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:41.600]   And that's what we do that day. And then the next day, something else comes up, which we have to
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:49.760]   firefight. And we, we're not getting our policies done. And I, and I just thought for me, that rings
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:58.400]   an awful lot truer than that. That country gets the odd phone call from a member of a Jewish family
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:03.200]   telling them, yeah, I just, you know, it's like, come on.
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:10.240]   So, you know, that's, I do, before I forget, when I ask you about Iran, what role do they play in
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:20.960]   this conflict? It's such a, it's fascinating how it seems like Iran is, uh, fingerprints are everywhere
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:28.320]   in the Middle East. And it's also fascinating that, you know, I have a lot of friends, my best friend is
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:33.520]   Iranian. It's fascinating that the Islamic revolution in Iran took the country from the leadership
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:41.520]   perspective backwards in such a drastic way. And that they're still in power. That confuses me
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:47.600]   because I know that now it's possible. I don't know the people of Iran. Sorry to make the obvious
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:54.800]   statement, but I just have a lot of friends in Iran and a lot of them, everybody I know there opposes
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:06.640]   the regime. And they're brilliant, educated, thoughtful, worldly people. And it confuses me that there's this,
[02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:12.000]   this is one of the, I would say, uh, one of the greatest nations on earth.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.560]   It's certainly one of the great cultures of the cultures, the peoples of Iran.
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:19.280]   Yeah. And then you look at that and then you look at the leadership
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:26.080]   when they're behind most of the terror groups in the region, certainly. Yeah.
[02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:32.800]   Can you just speak to that? And how is it still the same regime since 1979?
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:37.680]   I know, as you know, I start on democracy and death cults with the, the flight taking the Ayatollah
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:41.680]   Khomeini, Khomeini rather, uh, from Paris to Tehran.
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:47.600]   The flight that you say you wish never happened. I think it's one of the two worst journeys of the
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:53.280]   20th century. What's the other one? Was it Lenin's train getting to Petrograd?
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:54.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:57.280]   Oh, it's about the transportation.
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:04.720]   It's about, yes, I know. I'm really a transport guy. No, I, um, wait till my book of 10 best journeys.
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:06.880]   Yeah. Across the world.
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:15.200]   No, um, just as the train to the Finland station brought the basilis of Bolshevism into Russia.
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:23.920]   So the flight coming from Paris, bringing the Ayatollah Khomeini to Tehran brought the basilis of
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:33.600]   Khomeiniism, the most radical form of Shiite Islam to Tehran and to Iran. And it's one of the great
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:41.840]   tragedies of the modern era, what happened there. Like you, actually, I have a lot of Persian friends
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:48.560]   and I had the great good fortune early in my life to have a very close late friend who had grown up in
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:55.040]   pre-revolutionary Iran, was very fond of the Shah and, and, and so on. Her father had been an Ayatollah
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:40:02.720]   before the, the overthrow of the Shah. But, and you know, everyone had criticisms of him, but, um,
[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:09.680]   when you saw what came after him, it just, uh, it was among other things, uh, what I learned from her
[02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:16.400]   and other friends from that region was that I suppose two things. One is, of course, is that
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:22.080]   it's a sort of central conservative insight. You know, things can always be worse. They can always
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:31.120]   be worse. Never say this is rock bottom because, yeah, you know, like you might have a Shah with
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:38.480]   hundreds or even thousands of political prisoners in cells, but you could always have Ayatollah Khomeini
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:44.720]   butchering them all. And, um, including the people who helped him get to power, like the communists and
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:49.600]   the trade unionists who, who simply were fighting against the Shah and then were very useful for the
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:55.760]   Ayatollah until he didn't need them anymore. Um, but the other thing I learned from that particular
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:04.320]   friend and, and others was that was this, this thing that, and again, it's very hard for the Western
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:08.720]   mindset, very hard for the American mindset in particular, that there is such a thing as
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:14.160]   fanaticism, real fanaticism and real ideological and real religious fanaticism. And the thing that
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:20.640]   I described leads to the death cult mindset. That fanaticism is something which is very easy for the
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:28.400]   West to forget because we haven't seen it in a while. You know, we get very, um, distant echoes of
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:35.280]   it in our own societies, really. And we're highly attuned to hear them, which is good in some ways.
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:49.360]   Um, but Khomeiniism not only vastly set back the Persian people, the Iranian nation, but has managed
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:56.000]   to keep it in subjugation since 1979. And your question of why gets to one of the really
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:04.080]   the biggest questions really that, that has to be understood, the answer to which has to be understood,
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:10.160]   which is, it's what Solzhenitsyn says at one point in Gulag Archipelago in that passage where
[02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:17.920]   he describes when we heard the footsteps on the staircase and the knock was on our neighbor's door
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:25.600]   and we knew our neighbor was being taken away. Why did we not stop them?
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:39.040]   And in the case of the revolutionary government in Iran, you know, it's the same answer as whether
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:43.520]   it's Hamas governing Gaza with the people, whoever the people in Gaza are who would have liked to have
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:47.520]   seen them overthrown. You know,
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:57.760]   people don't realize that despite the rhetoric and everything else, everything changes if the other
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:08.080]   guy might kill you. And that, you know, when the green revolution in 2009 started in Iran,
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:17.360]   why was it put down? Why didn't it work? Why, like you, the sort of Iranians who I
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:23.200]   really hope one day get their country back, why did all these smart young students and others,
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:28.880]   why after they came out, why was it put down? It was put down because the Bastyej militia
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:36.000]   will shoot you in the head and they'll take you to a prison, as they did with the Iranian students,
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:45.120]   and they'll rape you with bottles and kill you. And even a little bit of that goes an awfully long way
[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:52.400]   to tell the rest of society not to do it again. You know, we know it happens like that from films,
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:44:02.880]   but too few people understand that regimes like that in Tehran operate like that on a grand scale,
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:09.760]   on the biggest of scales, and with the ultimate of brutality. And that's how they stay in power.
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:16.320]   And one other thing on that, by the way, which is, I was reminded of this the other day, but you know,
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:22.400]   thinking about this sort of, you know, what I've just described as a sort of a problem in democracies,
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:26.160]   is that we just, you know, we like to think everyone thinks like us, and you know, we'd like
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:31.600]   everyone to sort of be like us. And we, we believe fictions that we're taught in films like, you know,
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:38.640]   everyone basically wants the same things as us. And you go, you haven't stepped outside the walls of the
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:47.120]   city, if you think that. But the second thing is this thing of the death cults of why, why we sort
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:57.920]   of sing, singly fail to understand that this is possible. And Homanism is both very specific
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:05.280]   and also very strongly linked to totalitarian and radical and extremist death cult movements that are
[02:45:05.280 --> 02:45:12.720]   not that far in our past. I mean, you know, there's a moment in, uh, um,
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:19.920]   when Oriana Falaci interviewed the idol of Khomeini in 1979, one of the very few Western journalists to do
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:27.120]   so. She says to him, these people in the street, this movement, this revolution you've begun,
[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:37.840]   it's guided by hate. It's hate. It's all hate. And Khomeini says, no, no, it's love. It's love.
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:47.040]   And, and it's actually a scene that, that, that appears in the satanic verses of Rushdie where that
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:50.720]   exact same thing happens. But I was thinking about this recently because I was thinking, but
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:56.560]   how can you explain to a Western mindset that that's, that's something that's going on. There
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:05.680]   are people directed by this hate that calls itself love, this, this. And I was reminded of a book I
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:10.880]   haven't read since I was probably a teenager or something. It made a great impression on me then.
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:18.400]   Did you ever read the tragic sense of life? Uh, Miguel de Unamuno, a great Spanish existentialist
[02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:24.400]   philosopher who died in the thirties. Unamuno had a encounter with students at the university in
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:28.480]   the thirties when he realized, I mean, this is the, the, the early period of the Francoists,
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:34.880]   de Rivera and all those people. Unamuno is at this meeting and the chant goes up
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:41.600]   from the eager students who have fallen into this sort of phalangist,
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:50.080]   Francoist ideology already. They end up chanting in front of him as he's trying to defend the principles
[02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:58.560]   by which he has lived his life. They end up chanting in front of him, "Viva la muerte, long live death,
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:07.840]   long live death." And he tries to explain them, this is, this is a necrophilic chant.
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:18.480]   Yeah, but those young men in free Francoist Spain shouting long live death, they have their counterparts
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:27.200]   today. They are the people who, who taunt Americans, Westerners, Israelis, and others with lines like,
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:34.160]   we love death more than you love life. Yeah, that's the line you return to. That's a
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:42.080]   really difficult line to load in. Because if you base your whole existence on that notion,
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:47.840]   then, um, well, you're a danger to the world.
[02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:58.000]   That's a good foundation for committing evil. Um, I have to ask because you mentioned that interview,
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:07.280]   you had a good interview with Benjamin Netanyahu after October 7th. And I've been very fortunate to
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:13.200]   get the opportunity to interview a few world leaders. It looks like I'll interview Vladimir Putin and others.
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:18.240]   I want to have a general question about how do you interview people like this?
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:26.080]   Maybe to put your historian hat on, of like, how do you approach the interview of world leaders
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:35.040]   such that you can gain a deeper understanding in the hope that that adds to the compassion in the world.
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:46.160]   So I have, I have a deep sense that understanding people you might hate helps in the long arc of history, add compassion to the world.
[02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:51.840]   But even just to add understanding is difficult in those kinds of contexts.
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:59.360]   And, you know, maybe it's more useful to think about from a historian perspective of how you
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:09.120]   need to interview somebody like Hitler or Stalin or Churchill, FDR during World War II.
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:16.720]   It's not, you know, I think about this a lot, especially if it's, uh, you know,
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.120]   two, three, four, five hour conversation.
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:24.240]   Well, there's a lot of, uh, weight on you when you do those conversations, isn't there?
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:29.520]   From where? So like where, who's watching? Is it historians 20 years from then?
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:39.600]   Who knows? I mean, the whole data might be wiped. I, I, I suspect there's a weight on you because every
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:46.320]   major world leader you interview and you've done some amazing ones, but I mean, you, you, presumably
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:53.200]   you have a set of people saying you've got to ask him about this. You've, you, you can't not address
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:59.520]   this. And, and that's a very challenging one because of course, although in an interview with
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:08.960]   a politician, it should not, it should not be supine nor can it be endlessly interrogative
[02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:16.000]   because that you're not the prosecutor and they don't have to be the guilty party answering to
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:22.320]   you. And I've noticed the number of people who interview people, world leaders and others who
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:28.880]   go in with a set of sort of those things. And they, and, and at some point, the other party can just,
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:34.640]   just, I don't need this. And people criticizing you, we don't realize that you just can't do that.
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:40.400]   Yeah. I suppose what journalists behave the way they do. Although I have increasingly less and less
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:46.640]   respect for the journalists, uh, the average journalist, I have more and more respect for
[02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:52.400]   the great journalists as my respect for the average journalist decreases. Uh, because a lot of the
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:51:00.400]   journalists seem to be signaling to their own in, in group, but there is a lot of pressure on, uh,
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:06.000]   people in that situation to ask the, what I would say is the dumb question. Why is it the dumb question?
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:16.160]   Uh, the adversarial question that the, the world leader, the person is ready for, they've answered
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:23.680]   that question. And what you're trying to do is, I guess, one, to signal that you've asked the question
[02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:31.200]   to push them. Yes. Uh, two, you're trying to like, just create drama because really what people,
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:37.040]   people that ask you to ask that question, they want you to embarrass that person, they hate them.
[02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:43.200]   And they want you to like, make them piss their pants or something, or just start crying and run
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:49.040]   out. Yeah. Walk out in a way that it's embarrassing for them. They could be like, look at that pathetic
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:52:00.160]   person. Uh, and that reveals to me nothing except maybe the weakness of the interviewee that they can't
[02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:06.720]   stand up to a tough question. Yes. But mostly like I'm, I'm starting, I have to do a lot of thinking
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:13.760]   because you get attacked a lot. If you ask questions from a place of curiosity that actually
[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:19.600]   have a chance to reveal who the person is. There, there's a very interesting mind that Robin Day,
[02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:22.400]   who was quite a distinguished interviewer back to a very distinguished interviewer back in the day,
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:29.280]   uh, said about Jeremy Paxman, who was a very interrogative interviewer in the UK, uh, Robin Day,
[02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:34.880]   who was quite good at being rude to politicians, but carefully said the problem with the new approach
[02:52:34.880 --> 02:52:38.400]   as he saw it from the nineties of political interviewing was he said, if you think the
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:44.640]   person you're speaking to as a liar, you should get them to reveal that they're a liar. Don't just call
[02:52:44.640 --> 02:52:51.200]   them a liar. And I think that is, again, it's something that a lot of people sitting on the
[02:52:51.200 --> 02:53:00.560]   other side of the screen don't realize is that it may satisfy them that you call a person a liar to
[02:53:00.560 --> 02:53:07.600]   their face, but it doesn't do anything. And it actually reveals nothing. If somebody is a liar
[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:12.160]   and they reveal themselves to be a liar, then that's, that's something else. But yes, I mean,
[02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:19.040]   I can, I hear you. You're, you're obviously, you have a lot of different voices telling you what to do.
[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:25.760]   It's also difficult because one of the things that I don't think anyone really understands is that,
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:31.120]   is that in the end, it's just you. Yeah. I'm sure they, you have this about Putin.
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:36.560]   Like people say, I know exactly how you can, you know, they could give endless advice.
[02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:44.240]   The end is you sitting down and talking to him. It's, it's like, everybody knows how to behave on
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:49.440]   the presidential debate stage, but only a few people have done it in person. It's actually pretty
[02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:53.760]   difficult as I mean, it's very difficult because you've got all this weird behind the scenes stuff
[02:53:53.760 --> 02:53:58.400]   as well. You've got all of the games that people play. I mean, yeah, with, uh, you know,
[02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:04.560]   I interviewed Zelensky, you know, I'm pretty fearless in general. And he was a very human and
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:08.640]   fascinating human, but there is soldiers with guns standing all around.
[02:54:08.640 --> 02:54:13.360]   And you didn't have anyone? No one was packing on your side?
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:18.640]   I had one friend, a security person who was also crazy. You never know. He could turn on.
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:21.200]   You've been infiltrated.
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:24.720]   Yeah, exactly. No, I mean, uh, that doesn't have any effect. And by the way,
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:31.040]   I should mention that, uh, because it's, it's hilarious to me, but, um, process wise.
[02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:38.240]   No, with Narendra Modi and with anyone, they don't, they said it was scripted and all this
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:43.840]   kind of stuff. I would never do anything scripted. They don't get to have a say in anything.
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:50.720]   I asked to have complete freedom. Uh, sometimes you'll have people on the team very politely nudge,
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:57.280]   like, Hey, can you, uh, and I'll very politely say, thank you. You know, like smile, but that
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:02.720]   doesn't mean I have to fucking do it. I could do whatever the hell I want. The com, this actually,
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:07.520]   by the way, with world leaders, it doesn't happen. It happens more with CEOs because they have like,
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:15.040]   usually PR and comms people. They'll just be like very politely. Hey, you know, the thing about,
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:22.480]   about, you know, when they, that sexual assault, harassment charges, there's no reason to really
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:28.080]   linger on that. You don't have to do that. Yeah. One of my favorite things anyone has ever said,
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:32.800]   you know, it's only ever happening. I know a couple of cases of this happening in private,
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:39.600]   some friends, some, uh, a friend of mine once years ago was debating against the, this is before the
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:44.320]   war, the civil war in Syria was debating something to do with the middle East. And one of the people
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:49.600]   on the other side was the then Syrian ambassador in London. The then Syrian ambassador in London says
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:54.800]   something about the Israeli treatment of the Palestinians. And, uh, my friend stands up and starts
[02:55:54.800 --> 02:56:00.240]   talking about a sad seniors massacre of the Palestinians in hammer, where they killed like
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:05.680]   10,000 Palestinians in a day. Um, and my friend starts talking about the hammer massacre by, uh,
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:13.600]   a sad senior and the, the big fat Syrian ambassador like stands up to respond. And he says, that is,
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:20.640]   that is none of your business. And my friend was like, oh, I thought we were going to get it in denial.
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:27.200]   Uh, let me just ask you one more thing about Netanyahu. Um, because I also have the opportunity
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:34.800]   to do a three hour interview with him at this stage. And I've been, if I'm just being honest,
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:46.640]   very hesitant to do it. And I just don't know how a conversation there could, um, help add compassion
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:53.520]   to the world. And that particular topic, no matter how well you do it, you do take on a very large
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:57:03.200]   number of people that will just make it their daily activity to hate you and to write about it and to
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:09.280]   post about it and to accuse you of things. In some sense, I don't want to lose the part of me that's,
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:11.360]   that's vulnerable to the world.
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:16.560]   I think people have very little understanding of things. If they're willing to say that because
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:24.400]   you're sitting down and talking with somebody, you are ego platforming them, uh, um, advancing
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:30.080]   their cause, being used, being a shill or whatever like that, you might be actually just finding some
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:36.240]   things out, which I think something you do expertly. And another thing that your critics wouldn't realize
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:44.080]   is, is that they, you know, life is long and, you know, hopefully God willing, both around for a long
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:51.440]   time. And therefore you don't blow everything up at the request of some twat online. But I do think
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:57.920]   that a superpower of a kind is to identify the people whose opinion you care for and worry about their
[02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:02.960]   opinion and no one else's really. And, and just, you just keep your own guiding light. That's what's
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:08.640]   always done for me is that I, I, I've always said, I just don't really, I wouldn't care if I was the
[02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:15.440]   only person with my opinion and billions of people disagreed. I mean, I might be curious if the whole
[02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:20.880]   planet disagreed with me, but it doesn't fundamentally, that's not right. I'll send you
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:28.800]   Churchill's great speech on the death of Chamberlain. I mean it. He says the bit, he says one of the most
[02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:35.120]   wise and brilliant things. I was thinking about it slightly earlier when you were talking about Zelensky,
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:46.320]   because one of Churchill's greatnesses was his magnanimity. And when his great political opponent,
[02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:54.240]   Chamberlain died in 1940, and Churchill had just taken over as prime minister, he could have used
[02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:58.240]   the opportunity. And we might even say that some politicians in our day wouldn't be able to resist
[02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:02.800]   the opportunity. He could have used the opportunity to say, "You see, I was right."
[02:59:04.240 --> 02:59:07.680]   And Chamberlain didn't know what the hell he was doing, and he's led us into this mess. And you
[02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:12.800]   should have all listened to me. Because that would have been a good time. It would have been
[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:18.160]   a good time to say that that would have been one for the win, as they say. But Churchill doesn't do that
[02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:27.040]   in his great eulogy for Chamberlain. He talks about how hard it is for mankind to operate in the world,
[02:59:27.040 --> 02:59:33.520]   and how you can do it successfully. He very movingly says, he doesn't even mention the name of Hitler.
[02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:38.720]   He says, "What will never change his flaws?" He says, "Desiring of human peace, to be seeking peace."
[02:59:38.720 --> 02:59:44.160]   And he says, "The curse that he had was he was led astray by a very wicked man."
[02:59:44.160 --> 02:59:56.000]   But then he has this great passage where Churchill says, a beautiful, resonant passage about how he says,
[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:03.280]   "It's not given to men happily for them, for otherwise life would prove intolerable to foresee or to predict to any
[03:00:03.280 --> 03:00:08.800]   great extent the unfolding course of events." And he says, "For one phase, men seem to have been right,
[03:00:08.800 --> 03:00:14.000]   and in another they're proved wrong." And then there's a different scale of values emerges.
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:21.040]   And he says, "What is the worth of all this?" He says, "The only guide to a man is his conscience.
[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:26.400]   The only shield to his memory is the rectitude and the sincerity of his actions."
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:34.080]   And in fact, he says, "It doesn't matter what happens." If you have this, he finishes it,
[03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:43.200]   he says, "However the fates may play, that if you have this shield to guard you," he says,
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:52.160]   "You march always in the ranks of honor." All that can guide a man is that.
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:59.120]   If you lose sight of it, and some people do, and maybe everyone does at some point, then it's a
[03:00:59.120 --> 03:01:04.160]   challenge. And then you get buffeted by the to's and fro's of the waves of popular opinion.
[03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:13.440]   And that's dangerous. But if you keep sight and hold on to what you believe,
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:17.520]   a million, billion foes don't matter.
[03:01:17.520 --> 03:01:22.720]   Yeah, that is the path. We were talking offline about a great biography of Churchill.
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:30.160]   Churchill himself made mistakes and admitted the mistakes, and we can even say, was proud of the
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:34.800]   mistakes. I mean, learned from them. Learned from them. That's all the best you could do.
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:38.480]   The worst you could probably do is being afraid of making mistakes.
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:48.560]   That's what TR said about them in the man in the arena speech. TR. Yeah. Ah, the old TR.
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:56.880]   Those two have made quite a few mistakes, but in the end, some of the greatest humans ever created.
[03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:03.120]   Norm Macdonald, Churchill, and Teddy Russell.
[03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:06.720]   Did we do Norm? I think we did it before coming on air.
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:12.720]   Oh, before coming on air. Yeah. Well, he's always in everywhere in the, in the air around us.
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:16.160]   One of the, one of the great comedians.
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:21.520]   Um, all right. What gives you hope about this whole thing we have going on?
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:30.400]   Human civilization. You've been covering some of the darker aspects, the madness of crowds,
[03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:36.480]   the madness of geopolitics, the madness of wars. Sometimes when the sun shines through the clouds,
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:42.960]   and there's a smile on Douglas Murray's face, what's the source of the smile? The, the warmth.
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:45.600]   Endless numbers of things.
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:53.760]   Endless numbers of things. I mean, I get, I get enormous encouragement from smart young people,
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:56.960]   actually. That's one of the way. That's just the best thing ever.
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:03:07.440]   Um, I was in Kiev the other week and I was asked to speak to some students at the university and
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:15.440]   irrespective of the rather, you know, tricky situation that they are in. It's just great to,
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:23.600]   as you know, to speak to a room full of students about things and then hang around afterwards and
[03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:30.080]   just answer all the questions you can and hear from them about their lives and what they want to do and
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:37.040]   and remembering what you were like at their age and how goofy you were and how much you were going to
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:42.320]   get wrong and how much, you know, you had to learn and how much you were going to enjoy it and, and
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:50.080]   seeing the, uh, the opportunities they have in front of them if, if things go right and, and, uh,
[03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:54.240]   just smart young people giving enormous encouragement all the time. It's it's, that's the best thing.
[03:03:54.240 --> 03:04:00.960]   I mean, it's just, yeah, they're, uh, you can see endless possibility in their eyes and there's, uh,
[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:07.360]   they're not like burdened by, um, let's say, uh, the cynicism that builds up.
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:12.480]   But even the cynicism though, I mean, you can resist that. I mean, I've got quite a deep,
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:18.080]   well spring of it, but I mean, you can't only fall into that because
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:23.200]   there's so much else it doesn't cover. It'd be like spending your life being ironic, you know?
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:34.800]   Uh, so that said, you have seen a lot of war, especially recently and directly
[03:04:36.480 --> 03:04:42.320]   Ukraine, Israel, has that changed you?
[03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:47.840]   Has that dimmed some of that warmth and light?
[03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:57.360]   Uh, that's a very difficult question to answer. I don't know. Differs day to day.
[03:04:57.360 --> 03:05:01.680]   So sometimes there's a heaviness there because of the things you've seen.
[03:05:01.680 --> 03:05:04.480]   True. Yeah, I, I, at times, at times.
[03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:09.440]   You regret some going as much as you have to the front lines?
[03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:20.080]   No, no. One of the reasons why war is for writer kind of the ultimate subject
[03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:33.920]   is because you see life, weirdly, at its ultimate. Very, very strange, strange thing. But,
[03:05:33.920 --> 03:05:42.400]   you know, it just, it is the truth. Death, when it's in front of you, is something which
[03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:55.680]   gives, uh, uh, terrible clarity to everything. And, uh, it, you see how people will love and even
[03:05:55.680 --> 03:06:01.360]   sometimes laugh more, how they'll, um,
[03:06:01.360 --> 03:06:08.960]   there's an essay by Montaigne that's always on my mind, why we weep and laugh at the same time.
[03:06:11.040 --> 03:06:19.760]   Uh, everything's just more. And, um, and people, the real thing is the people, you see the, the,
[03:06:19.760 --> 03:06:25.440]   the very, very best of people and the very worst and they're beside each other.
[03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:31.520]   There's some, uh, so I've gotten a bunch of chances to interact with soldiers on the front line
[03:06:31.520 --> 03:06:37.520]   in Ukraine. And there is some level of like all the bullshit niceties or whatever it is of,
[03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:42.720]   of, uh, civilian life is all stripped away. It just seems more honest somehow.
[03:06:42.720 --> 03:06:49.680]   Yes, absolutely. Uh, absolutely. Well, I mean, I couldn't agree more. And then there's the wild
[03:06:49.680 --> 03:06:55.760]   clarity about things, not because of enemies or anything like that, but because of the, of,
[03:06:55.760 --> 03:07:01.840]   I joked, I think I mentioned, I joked about this with some Ukrainian soldiers in 22, because
[03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:08.800]   they wanted a cigarette and, uh, and, and, and we, and we stepped outside, I accompanied them outside
[03:07:08.800 --> 03:07:16.400]   because they weren't allowed to smoke indoors in this hotel, which there were rockets falling.
[03:07:17.280 --> 03:07:24.240]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I said to him, isn't it strange that fear of secondhand smoke
[03:07:24.240 --> 03:07:32.720]   has superseded this, but I, I don't know.
[03:07:32.720 --> 03:07:39.360]   It's seeing the humor in that, uh, uh, when you're on the front line, when you're fighting in a war,
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:45.280]   the humor of that is somehow just perfectly delicious. You could just laugh all day about that. And the
[03:07:45.280 --> 03:07:50.880]   absurdity of life is just right there. That's right. So honest and it's so beautiful. And
[03:07:50.880 --> 03:07:55.920]   that's why a lot of soldiers are traumatized. They're destroyed by war, but they also miss it.
[03:07:55.920 --> 03:07:59.840]   That's right. That's right. Absolutely. Oh my God. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:02.720]   There's an intimacy to the whole thing. Absolutely. Well, that's right. I mean,
[03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:05.760]   everyone says, you know, I never felt more alive, you know?
[03:08:05.760 --> 03:08:10.640]   Yeah. And I wouldn't, uh, I wouldn't do anything different.
[03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:20.880]   Well, I hope just like Churchill, you keep fighting the good fight and, uh, not listening to anybody and
[03:08:20.880 --> 03:08:26.240]   I'll try to, uh, learn to do the same. Douglas, I'm a huge fan. Thank you for doing this.
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:28.240]   It's been a great pleasure. Right back at you.
