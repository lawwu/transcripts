[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai,
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.240]   and in this episode, we're gonna talk about
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.400]   the amount of money needed to retire early
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.960]   and live in abject poverty or close to poverty.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.680]   And I know this is a funny title,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.520]   and you're thinking, what the hell am I talking about now?
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.880]   But I wanna highlight the math,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.760]   because the math doesn't lie.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.880]   It's really our emotions, our emotions that lie to us
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.320]   and make us believe that we need something
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.920]   or want something or can do something
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.440]   when we really don't need it or don't want it or can't.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.880]   And so this is a combination of emotion, desire,
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.280]   and the ability to retire early.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.000]   So as more people look to retire early,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.240]   which I define as under 60 years old,
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.760]   more people are looking for shortcuts
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.080]   in order to get to early retirement quicker.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.880]   And it's understandable that in this day and age
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.960]   of instant gratification,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.480]   young folks nowadays aren't willing to grind it out
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.920]   for decades like previous generations.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.160]   Instead of building a large enough passive income portfolio
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.640]   to cover a comfortable lifestyle,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.440]   I've noticed more people are willing to retire early
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.040]   to live in or near abject poverty.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.440]   My definition of financial independence
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.960]   or being able to retire early
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.640]   is to have enough investment income
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.320]   to cover your best life's living expenses.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.520]   So you don't have to work, and you can do whatever you want.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.200]   I think this is a logical definition,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.080]   but I think people are really not taking
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.440]   this definition seriously.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.800]   And I can empathize.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.560]   When I was 25 years old,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.760]   the terrorist attack of 9/11 happened.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.720]   This terrible, terrible, terrible event
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.520]   ignited my quarter life crisis.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.120]   I was working in finance.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.000]   I just got to San Francisco for a new job.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.680]   And I was seriously thinking about just hanging it all up
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.200]   and retiring with about $400,000
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.760]   due to some lucky investments
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.140]   and moving to Hawaii to become a fruit farmer
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.760]   on my grandparents' under-maintained farm.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.880]   It's not, it wasn't a really big farm.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880]   It was only eight acres in Wai'anae,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.800]   which is a really rough part of Honolulu or in Oahu.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.560]   It's probably the roughest part of Oahu,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   but it was a nice place.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.400]   There was some pummelo trees, mango trees.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.760]   It was only about a couple miles from the beach.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.480]   You could see the beach from the property just a little bit.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.720]   And I was thinking, man, you know what?
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.880]   This could be a good lifestyle
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.160]   in exchange for clearing the brush,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.920]   watering the trees, and doing general upkeep
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.620]   on a very old and dusty house.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.140]   I could live for free and make some extra money
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.760]   selling mangoes, papayas, and pummelos down the street.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.280]   Maybe $10,000, I don't know.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.880]   But then after I thought about it a little bit more,
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.760]   I kind of slapped myself silly and bucked up.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.480]   Throwing away a perfectly good career in finance
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.240]   at 25 years old was incredibly naive and stupid.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.680]   It was one of those gotta get your patience down
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.720]   and grind it out because 400,000,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.960]   even though that sounds like a lot,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.360]   and it is a lot for someone who's 25 years old,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.680]   is not enough for a long, long time in my head.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.620]   So I gutted it out for another nine, 10 years
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.200]   until my investments could generate about 80,000 a year
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.840]   and cover my desired living expenses
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.220]   in San Francisco in 2012.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.400]   So back in 2001, it's important to note
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.420]   that the 400,000 could only generate
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.400]   about 20 to $24,000 in risk-free income.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.000]   And I used the wrong word.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   It's not only, it's, hey, not bad, 20 to $24,000 a year
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.120]   because the risk-free bond yield,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.760]   the 10-year bond yield was more around 5 to 5.5%.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.000]   But today, the $400,000 can only generate
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.380]   about 8,000 to 9,000 a year in risk-free income
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.120]   given the 10-year bond yield has collapsed down to about 2%.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.760]   Therefore, there's no way today
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.280]   I could retire early on 400,000,
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.120]   even if I was a really happy-go-lucky guy
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.560]   and just one person,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.480]   because the federal poverty limit,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.720]   as determined by the federal government,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.720]   for one person is $12,140 a year.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.820]   So I wanted to use this episode and this post and podcast
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.720]   to talk about the federal poverty level limit.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.920]   So if you go to the post, you'll see a great chart
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.880]   that highlights the federal poverty level limit,
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.080]   100% up to 400%.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.560]   And these numbers, these income figures are very important
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.960]   because these income figures are what allow you
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.680]   to get subsidized health insurance,
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.200]   whether you are retired or not.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.840]   So in other words, the government believes
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.760]   that if you make 400% or less
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.660]   of the baseline federal poverty level,
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.500]   you are considered poor enough to receive federal assistance.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.520]   You are not rich enough to actually pay more
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.040]   to help other people.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.140]   Let's be honest here.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.500]   Don't get defensive.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.360]   Don't get sensitive that I'm saying this.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.040]   This is what the federal government has decided.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.240]   And to just go through some of these numbers,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.000]   a household size of one,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.560]   the federal baseline poverty level limit is 12,140.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.640]   Household size of two is 16,460.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.180]   Household size of three, 20,780.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.180]   Household size of four, 25,105, 29,420.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.300]   And then 200% of the federal poverty level
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.420]   is double that, basic math.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.960]   So I think the household income levels
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.280]   between 300% to 400% of FPL seem comfortable
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.720]   as long as the household doesn't live
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.960]   in an expensive coastal city like San Francisco,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.000]   New York, or Los Angeles.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.880]   For example, I have to imagine a couple with two kids,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.400]   so a household of four making between 75,300,
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   that's 300% of FPL, to 100,400, which is 400% of FPL,
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.480]   is gonna be able to live a decent, comfortable lifestyle
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.940]   in the heartland of America
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.400]   where I've been aggressively investing in real estate
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.960]   for the past three years.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.240]   Just recently, you heard the University of Texas
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.680]   out of Austin announce families earning less than 65,000
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.080]   would not have to pay a single dollar of tuition
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.840]   starting in 2020.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   Meanwhile, families making up to 125,000
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.080]   would also receive some type of tuition subsidy.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.600]   So that's really, really great news,
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.000]   and obviously Texas, Austin, and this heartland of America.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.700]   So again, if you're, they're saying you still get subsidies
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.700]   if you make up to 125,000, that's pretty good.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.160]   However, I argue, as does the government,
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.800]   that any household income between 100% to 200%
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.280]   of FPL is gonna be a little difficult to survive on.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.860]   It's gonna be difficult to get ahead
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.240]   if that's what you have.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.000]   And even in retirement, I don't think that's enough
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.880]   because of just extraneous expenses that come up,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.500]   whether it's trying to take care of your parents,
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.560]   taking care of your kids, accidents, healthcare,
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.480]   even though you're gonna get subsidies.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.760]   Those subsidies, yeah, they're good,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.440]   but man, there's some huge deductions at the ACA level
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.200]   where you get these subsidies.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.700]   You know, we're talking 5,000, $10,000 subsidies,
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.400]   and that's after tax, which could easily wipe you out.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.860]   So in a post, I highlight a chart,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.800]   and I crunch the numbers that shows how big
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.760]   of an after-tax retirement portfolio you need
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.360]   by household size and percentage return
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.360]   if your household income is 100%, which is abject poverty,
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.520]   to 200% of FPL, which is near poverty.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   And so let me just share some numbers with you
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.740]   on this podcast.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.600]   So in order to retire early and live in a household income
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   equal to 200% of FPL, and a conservative 2% rate of return,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.000]   or, quote, safe withdrawal rate,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.080]   it really is safe at 2% because that's the risk-free rate
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.080]   of return right now, you will need to amass 1.214 million
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.720]   as an individual, and up to 3.374 million
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.800]   for a household of six.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.600]   That's a lot, that's a lot, lot, folks.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.200]   Now, let's say you don't wanna have a household of six,
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.400]   you know, let's say a household of four,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.960]   you gotta amass about 2.5 million.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.880]   If you're okay with living in abject poverty,
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.520]   or 100% of FPL, and expect a conservative 2% rate
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.120]   of return or withdrawal rate,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.980]   then you'll only need to amass 607,000 as an individual,
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.160]   and up to 1.7 million for a household of six.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.680]   If a couple wants to have two children,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.580]   which is more or less standard nowadays,
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.000]   one and a half to two children,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.600]   and earn up to 200% of FPL to have more breathing room
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.200]   in early retirement, they need to amass
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.360]   between one million to 2.5 million
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.320]   in an after-tax portfolio based on a 5%
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.180]   down to a 2% withdrawal rate, and so forth.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.280]   So just think about that, folks.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.200]   If you wanna retire early and live in poverty
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.960]   or near poverty with a family, right, with kids,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.820]   you're probably gonna need at least a million dollars.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.080]   So it's kind of backwards.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.620]   It's kind of a weird thought process.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.420]   And again, the math doesn't lie.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.740]   It's just the way it is.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.380]   And given that the risk-free bond yield is at 2%,
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.020]   I would really not use a withdrawal rate
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.780]   of higher than 4%.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.900]   Yes, we've had a 10-year bull market,
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.320]   and the returns are like 8% to 9% to 10% a year,
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.740]   but do you really expect that to continue?
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.340]   And do you really wanna count on those type of returns
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.040]   to continue once you stop working?
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.000]   My answer is no, and I think your answer should be no, too.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.480]   I would use a safe withdrawal rate
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.560]   or expected compound return rate of around 3%,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.440]   so 50% higher than the risk-free rate of return.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.560]   And remember, this is just assuming
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.080]   you're gonna steadily make money
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.960]   every single year in your portfolio,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.640]   whereas in fact, you know that every 10, 15 years,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.580]   there's like a downturn.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.320]   2018, we saw a downturn, right?
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.880]   The markets were down 6%.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.540]   And obviously, 2008, 2009,
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.500]   the markets were down like 35%.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.880]   So it can get ugly out there,
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.420]   so you don't wanna just count on this steady,
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.540]   unrealistic rate of return.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.560]   So the question I have for all of you
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.740]   looking to retire early
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.300]   or looking for financial independence is,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.520]   is it worth living in poverty
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.300]   or near poverty to retire early?
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.900]   For the first 13 years of my life,
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.420]   I grew up in emerging countries like Zambia and Malaysia
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.700]   because my parents were in the US Foreign Service.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.180]   I was surrounded by poverty,
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.860]   and it made me question life,
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.380]   question why I'm studying or why I wanna earn money
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.580]   and what I wanna do with my life,
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.820]   because it's kinda scary.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.860]   I had friends, a couple best friends
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.260]   in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.820]   who would share one room and a bathroom
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.540]   with three other family members.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.820]   We're talking one room, maybe 400 square feet,
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.900]   maybe 500 square feet,
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.880]   and bunk beds all along the walls,
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.060]   and where they would just hang out on their bunk beds,
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.780]   have lunch, dinner, breakfast in the center of the room,
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.860]   and then just go to the bathroom.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.700]   There was no privacy, nothing.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.060]   So here in the United States,
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.620]   I mean, we've got it large and we've got it good,
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.860]   and because I saw so much poverty growing up,
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.380]   it just made me afraid of becoming poor.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.740]   And when I came to America in 1991,
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.540]   I decided not to take my good fortune for granted.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.360]   I was like, you know what?
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.180]   I don't wanna live in a one room
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.000]   with four other people or three other people.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.240]   I wanna have my own car, I wanna have my own place,
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.640]   and I wanna have some options.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.900]   So I just hit the books and I just really focused.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.500]   And until this day, at 42 years old in 2019,
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.680]   I'm not taking my good fortune for granted.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.960]   There is no way, because if I do,
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.680]   I feel like I'm disrespecting the people
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.540]   who don't have the same opportunity.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.540]   So, even though money doesn't buy happiness,
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.360]   money has to at least cover all our basic living expenses
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.680]   before we can really believe in such an ideology.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.960]   So I personally would not be willing to retire early
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.320]   if I had to live in or near poverty.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.000]   Although my work in finance was very stressful,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.160]   and my wife's work in finance was pretty stressful,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.800]   it allowed us to own a comfortable home in San Francisco.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.760]   It allowed us to take four to six weeks of vacation a year.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.400]   It allowed us to drive a reasonably safe vehicle,
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.160]   and also it allowed us to potentially raise a family
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.520]   if our son came while we were still working.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.120]   And these are great things.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.760]   I mean, the work wasn't that bad.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.680]   Yeah, there were micromanagers,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.540]   terrible amounts of pressure and unreasonable clients,
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.720]   but hey, we were living a life that we enjoyed.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.140]   And for the now three of us, since we have a son,
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.140]   to live off only $41,560 a year, or 200% of FPL,
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.040]   that would require us to leave San Francisco
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.480]   and start living with my parents in Hawaii to save on rent.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.320]   And although plenty of readers have stated
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.760]   they have no problem living at home
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.680]   with their parents as adults, we definitely do.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.920]   Our parents, they're in their 70s.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.880]   They value their privacy.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.880]   We're in our late 30s and early 40s.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.000]   We value our privacy.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.720]   We're all set in our ways.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.680]   Living together for an extended period of time
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.560]   would be very, very difficult.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.040]   And then there's alternatives.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.760]   Well, one alternative is living
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.120]   a more comfortable early retirement lifestyle
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.440]   by having a higher withdrawal rate.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.880]   But I will tell you that if you spend 10, 20, 30 years
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.080]   saving and investing aggressively, you will feel very odd.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.520]   It'll be very difficult for you to draw down more
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.360]   or spend more.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.840]   It's just kind of a weird thing, and I just can't do it.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   I feel like it's like a sin to withdraw down principle.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.320]   The other alternative, which I think most early retirees
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.240]   do nowadays, is freelance or take on odd jobs
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.520]   to make up for their earnings shortfall.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.160]   And I think this makes a lot of sense.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.760]   If you have a wealth of experience,
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.800]   surely you can at least get a minimum wage job
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.360]   doing something that isn't gonna hurt your back
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.200]   or something.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.720]   But where things can get hairy is when the early retiree
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   spends endless hours trying to make extra income
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.920]   because their investment portfolios are too small.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.600]   So again, it goes back to my definition
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.880]   of what is financial independence
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.960]   and what is being allowed to retire early comfortably,
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.800]   and that is having enough investment income
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.960]   to cover your desired lifestyle's living expenses.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.280]   So if you're just hustling for another 40 to 60
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.000]   to 70 hours a day trying to make money online
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.680]   or doing something else, you've essentially traded
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.320]   one job for another, and that's fine,
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.840]   but don't pretend like you are financially independent
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.100]   or you've retired, 'cause you're not.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.880]   And I've personally been accosted
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.960]   by the internet retirement police many, many, many times
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.600]   before over this 10-year journey of Financial Samurai,
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.680]   and they say, "You know what?
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.880]   "You're not retired because of Financial Samurai."
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.680]   And I say, "You know what?
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.760]   "You're probably right," which is why I don't tell anybody
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.020]   that I run Financial Samurai in real life.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.080]   I just say, if they ask, I'm a writer
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.640]   or a high school tennis coach,
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.000]   and then just make them wonder,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.760]   why do I have so much free time?
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.720]   But isn't it funny that if Financial Samurai
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.920]   was a little speck, it still is a speck on the internet,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.960]   but if it was much smaller, I'd get more approval
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.320]   from the internet retirement police.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.600]   They would allow me to say that I am an early retiree
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.120]   or whatever, so the lesson here is never stick out
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.020]   because a hammer will try to bang you down.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.480]   In real life, you should be as stealth wealth as possible.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.620]   Keep low key.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.680]   So in a post that I wrote about this subject,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.660]   I highlight a budget on retiring early on 200%
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.520]   federal poverty level limit for a family of three.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.700]   And that number comes out to about $3,100 a month
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   after a 10% effective tax rate.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.040]   And I don't know, I look at it and I get mad
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.920]   at how little I can spend because I want better
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.560]   for my wife and son.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.400]   I mean, I think every single parent wants better
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.000]   and because I see how little I can spend.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.480]   I mean, I'm talking about like $50 a day.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.880]   No, sorry, $50 a month for my boy.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.600]   You know, I can't even send him to like a Jamboree class
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.040]   'cause that's like $100 a month.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.680]   So this budget makes me mad, but it also makes me motivated.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   And it also makes me realize that I just can't do 200% FPL.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.960]   I need an income of about 300% of FPL or $62,340
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.160]   in early retirement to feel reasonably comfortable.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.360]   At a 3% safe withdrawal rate,
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.840]   we therefore need a portfolio of at least $2.1 million.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.940]   And again, the math doesn't lie.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.400]   So I want you guys to do the math, to do the math yourself,
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.280]   to be really honest about your budget
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.320]   and your withdrawal rate
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.080]   and how your lifestyle might change over time.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.680]   Don't rush early retirement.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.280]   Don't rush it because you're feeling this FOMO
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.780]   or seeing other people do it.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.160]   I can guarantee you that there's a lot of negatives
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.000]   on early retirement and there's a lot of doubt
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.200]   for people who retire too early.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.400]   One of my big regrets was retiring too early.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.200]   You know, 34, 34 and a half,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.360]   it's just in retrospect, it's kind of stupid.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.360]   It really is, folks.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.480]   I wish I gutted it out for probably
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.840]   two or three more years at least.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.920]   You know, originally it was to 40,
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.080]   but two or three more years, I would have saved more,
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.240]   earned more, built more passive income.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.000]   And I think it would have been better.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.800]   But you know what, I can't rewind the past
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.080]   or I can't go back in time.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.200]   And I can just only advise you folks,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.480]   you younger folks who are just itching,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.020]   itching to get out there,
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.220]   just take your time and please, please run the numbers.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.800]   So I did a cool survey, 1,200 votes so far,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.700]   1,200 participants, and I asked,
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.640]   are you willing to live in poverty or near poverty
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.960]   so you can retire early?
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   And 72% or 885 votes say no.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.040]   72%, that's good.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.200]   I'm thankful that people are pretty logical.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.760]   And the second highest vote getter was 13% saying yes,
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.120]   I'm willing to live near poverty.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.880]   That's 200% of FPL so I can retire early,
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.800]   but not in abject poverty or 100% of FPL.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.060]   So I thought that was interesting, folks.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.560]   I'm glad I'm reaching out to you guys
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.380]   and trying to make some sense.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.380]   Nobody can tell you how you can live your life.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.160]   I'm just telling you,
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.960]   the government has the numbers.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.200]   I've gone through this experience now
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.780]   as a seven plus year unemployed guy with a family.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.020]   And you might look back if you retire too soon
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.320]   and regret it because you'll be like,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.000]   well, life wasn't too bad.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.720]   The health benefits, the income, the security, not so bad.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.240]   So don't take your work for granted.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.680]   Find ways to improve your work environment
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.620]   or find another job.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.240]   I'd love to hear from all of you guys
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.560]   and leave me a comment if you got some time.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.500]   Otherwise, I'll talk to you guys later.
