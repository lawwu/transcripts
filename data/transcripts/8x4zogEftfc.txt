[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   - A few years back I had a chance to sit down
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.680]   with some friends of ours at CCEF,
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.760]   the Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.840]   in Philadelphia.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.920]   I had a chance to sit down with Dr. David Powleson,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.140]   a biblical counselor and one of my favorite authors.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.200]   And I asked Dr. Powleson, what is sinful anger
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.940]   and what does it express?
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.940]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.120]   - Sinful anger is an expression of the fact
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.720]   that I am not pleased with what is going on right now
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.480]   with you, you jerk, or whatever's the variant thereof.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.320]   Sinful anger presumes a, and the Greek or Norse mythology
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.480]   is just great in this.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.960]   I mean, it presumes a Zeus or a Thor
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.280]   or some guy throwing thunderbolts
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.360]   'cause the world's not going the way he wants.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.080]   And the Bible just so enters that metaphor
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.640]   that the mythologies capture
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.920]   and just puts us right in the seat of the kingdom builders,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.200]   the ones who attempt to live for my way
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.680]   and the ones that when my almighty will gets crossed,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.440]   I throw lightning bolts at all offenders
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   or I sulk or I passive aggressive in some way demonstrate
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.000]   that you are not giving me what I want
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.120]   and you are in the doghouse in some way.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   So the Bible has these absolutely unmistakable
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.240]   heart-searching, pride-devastating analyses of sinful anger.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.880]   One of the ones that I have found most convicting
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.480]   and then from conviction the most nourishing
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.760]   is in James 4.12 where James says,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.980]   and it's in a context of anger and interpersonal conflict
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.960]   and all kinds of fussing and fighting and quarreling.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.680]   And he says, "There is only one lawgiver and judge.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.800]   "He who is able to save and to destroy.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.680]   "Who are you that you judge your neighbor,
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.040]   "that you speak against your brother?"
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.800]   And it is one of those that just peels off,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.720]   it just peels away the front story
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.360]   and gets to the back story behind anger.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.240]   Seeing that inner core of anger is tremendously helpful
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.280]   in one's sanctification, in pastoral counseling,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.040]   preaching and so forth.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   I'd liken it to, let's take a typical parent-child
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.200]   or husband-wife interpersonal conflict
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.320]   and I'll sometimes literally physically pick up two books
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.640]   that are closed, two fat books,
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.960]   and I'll bang them together cover to cover.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.800]   You know, here's the conflict and why are we fighting?
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.040]   And this book says, "We're fighting 'cause of you."
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.320]   And this book says, "We're fighting 'cause of you."
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.720]   And the Lord opens the books to reveal the heart
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.680]   and says, "You are fighting because of you, yourself.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.640]   "You're fighting because of your heart."
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.840]   Even if the other person's not doing right
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.800]   and in fact is doing wrong,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   sinful anger is an expression of your playing God,
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.080]   according to James 4:12.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.000]   Who are you if you judge your brother?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.720]   Who are you if you speak evil of him?
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.640]   Well, you're God.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.600]   You're acting as though you are a lawgiver and judge.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.040]   And that inner core of anger is something
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.080]   that none of the self-help books in Barnes & Noble
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.540]   or on Amazon is going to tell you.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.680]   It's one of those things that from a biblical point of view
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   is utterly obvious and so sanity-inducing
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.320]   to be able to see that.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.200]   You know, the covers of the human heart are peeled away.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.160]   The book is open.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.080]   I can actually look at, well, why am I embittered?
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.720]   And why is there that cutting, sarcastic edge in my voice?
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.300]   And why am I raising my voice?
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.680]   And there's a tone of real disdain or disgust
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.040]   towards the person that I'm angry at.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   And as you really open the book as the way God opens it,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.120]   you see yourself that there is a pride, a God playing,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.040]   a passion for my will be done
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.080]   that has taken over the controls.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.880]   So, godly anger.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.760]   I think of this as, it's one of those things that,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.740]   again, the delightful way scripture,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.040]   it is just an inch away,
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.080]   and yet it is 10 million miles away.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.400]   One example I like to think in this is that
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   both Satan and Jesus point out our sins
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.800]   and express anger.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.240]   But Satan expresses anger driven by pride
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.240]   and self-will and condemnation unto his own purposes.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.600]   Christ expresses a holy anger unto God's glory
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   that is an anger that has chosen to bear the wrath himself.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.980]   And so, they're both pointing out what's wrong,
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.440]   but one voice is pointing out what's wrong.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.120]   The log is not in Jesus' eye
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.840]   when he's looking at our specks.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.140]   And he's able to, he is thus able for his children
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.320]   to put his finger right in our eye
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.200]   and to rummage around and get rid of the speck,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.320]   whereas sinful anger would go in there and go,
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.940]   and stick you in your eye.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.620]   It's, both have to do with right and wrong.
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.440]   Now, righteous anger sees right and wrong
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.280]   more clearly, typically.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   But you can actually see what's wrong
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.820]   and be sinfully angry.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.360]   It is a different issue.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.200]   The seeing what's wrong is your circumstance
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.760]   that's coming at you.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.800]   And the choice of whether your anger
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.040]   will either be fundamentally godless
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.320]   or fundamentally, though firm and vigorous,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.440]   also laced with mercy
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.320]   and fundamentally submitted to Christ's kingdom.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.320]   That is the life and death difference
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.020]   for a person tempted to be angry.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.400]   - That was Bible counselor and author,
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.000]   Dr. David Powleson of ccef.org.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.600]   His books include "Speaking the Truth in Love"
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.680]   and "Seeing with New Eyes."
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.160]   We will hear from him again next week.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.680]   And on this topic of anger,
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.280]   it reminds me of an episode we recorded a while back.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.080]   I asked John Piper, if God is so happy,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.720]   why does he seem so angry?
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.420]   That was episode number 133,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.860]   which you can find at desiringgod.org.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.440]   But another weekend is upon us.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.620]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.760]   I'll see you on Monday.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.920]   (silence)
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.080]   (silence)
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.240]   (silence)
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
