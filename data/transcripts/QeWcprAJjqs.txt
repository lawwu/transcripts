[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   So much is being digitized today and there's this ideas that are based on the blockchain
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.260]   of Bitcoin and so on.
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.080]   So if all currencies, like all empires, come to an end, what do you think will, do you
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.940]   think something like Bitcoin might emerge as a common store of value, a store of wealth
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.440]   and a medium of exchange?
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.580]   The problem with Bitcoin is that it's not an effective medium of exchange.
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.940]   Like it's not easy for me to go in there and buy things with it.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.540]   And then it's not an effective storehold of value because it has a volatility that's based
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.300]   on speculation and the like.
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.820]   So it's not a very effective saving.
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.300]   That's very different from Facebook's of a stable value currency, which would be effective
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.980]   as both a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.520]   Because if you were to hold it and the way it's linked to, number of things that it's
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.500]   linked to, would mean that it could be a very effective storehold of wealth.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.660]   Then you have a digital currency that could be a very effective medium of exchange and
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.460]   storehold of wealth.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.980]   So in my opinion, some digital currencies are likely to succeed more or less based on
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.940]   that ability to do it.
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.060]   Then the question is, what happens?
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.180]   What happens is, do central banks allow that to happen?
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.900]   I really do believe it's possible to get a better form of money that central banks don't
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.900]   control.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.300]   A better force of money that the central banks don't control.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.700]   But then that's not yet happened.
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.100]   And so they've got to go through that evolutionary process.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.260]   In order to go through that evolutionary process, first of all, governments have got to allow
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.060]   that to happen, which is to some extent a threat to them in terms of their power.
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.700]   And that's an issue.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.780]   And then you have to also build the confidence in all of the components of it to say, "Okay,
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.260]   that's going to be effective because I won't have problems owning it."
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:25.700]   So I think that digital currencies have some element of potential, but there's a lot of
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.460]   hurdles that are going to have to be gotten over.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.060]   I think that it'll be a very long time, possibly never, but anyway, a very long time before
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.180]   we have that, let's say, get into a position that would be in an effective means relative
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.800]   to gold, let's say.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.260]   If you were to think of that, because gold has a track record of thousands of years all
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.980]   across countries.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.420]   It has its mobility.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.060]   It has the ability to put it down.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.060]   It has certain abilities.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.780]   It's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies, but central banks will hold it.
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.180]   Like there's central banks that worry about others.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.620]   Other countries, central banks might worry about whether the US dollar is going to print
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.140]   or not and that, and so the thing they're going to go to is not going to be the digital
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.140]   currency.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.180]   The thing they're going to go to is gold or something else, some other currency.
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.540]   They got to pick it, and so I think it's a long way to go.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.380]   But you think it's possible that one day we don't even have a central bank because of
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:37.620]   a currency that cannot be controlled by the central bank is the primary currency?
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.580]   Or does that seem very unlikely?
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:49.220]   It would be very remote possibility or very long in the future.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.340]   Got it.
