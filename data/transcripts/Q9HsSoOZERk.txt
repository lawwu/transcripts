[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   The fear of death keeps people off jets and in cars, which is a more deadly form of transportation.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   The fear of death exerts tremendous force over people in this world. It makes us irrational.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   So what counsel do we have for Christians who live under a perpetual fear of their own mortality?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   The question arises from a woman who has not given us her name. Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I have listened to the podcast on YouTube for several months now and finally built up enough courage to ask a question of my own.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   I have been building a relationship with God and have thankfully been delivered from a love of alcohol.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I am 25, married to a godly man, and have been struggling with the thought of death now on a daily basis.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I think it started when my friend passed last year.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Before that, a friend of mine and my sister, just months apart, both had dreams that I died while I was still drinking.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   By the grace of God, he allowed me to let go of that habit, but I can't stop thinking that something will happen to me.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I decided to get to the root that I have a fear of death.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   All I sometimes think of is dark, depressing thoughts, and I do not want to live my life like this.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Please, Pastor John, can you give me some insight?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   My experience over the years is that sometimes God delivers people from the bondage of fixations,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   like the fixation with the possibility of dying, in a roundabout way that seems surprising.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So, if this seems roundabout, what I'm about to do, roundabout and jolting, hold on and at least give it consideration.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I'm picking up first—she doesn't give us her name, so I'll just call her our friend—
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I'm picking up from our friend's wording that her view of God and His sovereignty over our lives,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   including when and how we die, may not be as biblical and as solid and as freeing as God means it to be.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   She says, for example, with regard to her former drinking problem,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   "By the grace of God, he allowed me to let go of that habit."
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Hmm. He allowed me to let go of that habit.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Now, that kind of language, that allowing language in relation to God's work in our lives,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   sends alarm bells off in my mind that her view of God's sovereignty,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   God's rule over her personal life and over her willing and her actions, like drinking, are something like this.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   If God would just step aside, then I will let go of this habit.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Now, she may not mean that, but sometimes the language we use speaks more deeply about what we believe than what we say we believe.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   She did say, "God allowed me to let go of that habit." Really?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So the first thing I want to urge our anxious friend to celebrate
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   is that God is way more actively involved in our habit-breaking than mere allowing or permitting.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Hebrews 13.21 says, "He equips you with everything good to do his will,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Which means that God is fully able in his time, in his way, to take away not only the desire to drink,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   but the fear of death and the fixation on death.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   God is able not just to allow you to do it, but to do it decisively in and through you.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Now, related to this view of God's sovereignty in delivering us from fixations in our minds
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   is God's sovereignty over death itself, which is so crucial for, I think, our friend to grasp.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I want our friend to see in God's Word that God has final and decisive control over how and when we die.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   This is true, even though Satan has some secondary role to play.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   He's not absolute. He's not decisive. He's not final. He's always on a leash.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   For example, when Job's ten children die in one day, Job says, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord," Job 1.21. "Blessed be the name of the Lord. He took my children away."
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And James says in James 4.15, "Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town and spend a year there,'
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   instead you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live.'"
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   "If the Lord wills, we will live."
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   God decides if we live and do this or that.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   This has filled God's people with incredible courage and energy and joy over the centuries in very risky circumstances of ministry.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Why? Because we are immortal until our Father decides to bring us home.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Think of it. Immortal. Immortal. You are immortal. I wish I knew your name. I wish I could say it to Jane, Mary.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   You are immortal until God's work for you is done.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You really will not die. You will not die until God intends for you to die.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   This is wonderful. I mean, where else would you rather rest than in this?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   You're not at the mercy of Satan. You are not at the mercy of nature.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   You are not at the mercy of man's cleverness or carelessness or evil.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You are rock solid secure in God's omnipotent hands, and you will not die except at his decision.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Where else would you want that decision to lie?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   He is your all wise, all knowing, all merciful Father, which leads Jesus to say these sweetest of all words.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And then ironically, after telling us to fear God, here's what he really means by that.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny, and not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your father?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Picture your father leaning over you asleep in your crib, counting your hairs.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   He says no problem for him. Start over, verse 30.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Therefore, you are of more value than many sparrows.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Fearless, fearless, fearless. And he's good. He's your father.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Jesus died. Jesus died to secure Romans 8, 28 and Romans 8, 32, Romans 8, 37 for his sinful children.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Sinful children. All things work together for good.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Death cannot separate us from the love of Christ.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Everything we need in life and death was bought by the blood of Jesus.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   So Paul says, "To live is Christ. To live is Christ, and to die is gain."
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So here's my counsel to our anxious friend and the rest of us.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Instead of trying to stop thinking about death every time that thought comes into your head,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   instead of trying to stop thinking about death, instead say to death, "Go ahead, death. Make my day.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   If you let me live, Christ will be honored on earth in my life.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   If you take away my life, I get more of Christ in heaven. I can't lose."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And then get on with your work. Make a meal, vacuum a rug, close a real estate deal, give a flu shot.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Go about your daily life with a totally happy uncertainty about when you will die.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Amen. Immortal until God's work for me is done.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. That's a great perspective. So good. Thank you.
