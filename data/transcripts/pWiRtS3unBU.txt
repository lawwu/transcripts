[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   All right, enough of that nonsense.
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.300]   Let's move on.
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.660]   Today's deep dive is not about email.
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.000]   So what do I want to talk about?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.820]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.820]   I receive a lot of emails from listeners and readers
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.240]   about struggling to take back control of their life
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.360]   from powerful sources of distraction.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.560]   Now, because I'm a technologist
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.840]   and I write about tech and society,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.160]   they're often citing technological sources of distractions
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.040]   like social media.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.600]   I hear increasingly, especially from young men,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.920]   about online pornography as well.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.000]   In addition, though, I've been hearing more often recently
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.560]   non-digital sources of super distractions.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.280]   So we're talking alcohol consumption
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.500]   is a big one I hear about as well.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.920]   I often call these super distractions
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.980]   because they're more than just a diversion
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.040]   for the people who are suffering from them.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.020]   It is a major impediment to them actually getting
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.960]   where they want to get in their life.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.800]   They are holding them back,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.600]   not just momentarily diverting them.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.760]   So I thought I would talk about super distractions today.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.040]   I thought I would talk about what causes them
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.000]   and more importantly, what you can do to combat them.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.720]   And so I want to break up this deep dive into three parts.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.200]   I'll start by myth-busting common misconceptions
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.960]   about the source of super distraction
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.640]   and replace it with the idea I think actually makes sense.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.000]   We'll then use that idea, this deeper understanding
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   of how super distractions actually form
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.660]   to come up with a new mindset about how you tackle them.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.340]   And then finally, I want to use that new mindset
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.320]   to get tactical.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.800]   And I've got a series of concrete steps to suggest
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.880]   about how you put this new understanding
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.440]   of super distractions into work, into action,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.140]   to take back control of your life.
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.880]   All right, so that's our plan.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.840]   Let's start here with a little bit of myth-busting.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.640]   There are two common explanations
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.480]   for how people get to the state
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.800]   where there's some sort of super distraction behavior
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.360]   that really gets in the way of them living
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.240]   their fully flourishing life.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.960]   The first is utility maximization.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.840]   It's this idea that in every moment,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.880]   my mind evaluates the options and says,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.640]   which option is going to give me the biggest return
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.580]   in the moment?
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.400]   That's what I'm going to spend my time on.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.080]   It's a common explanation for digital super distractions.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.560]   The sort of canonical case study here is,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.820]   I probably should be studying for my test,
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.600]   but TikTok in the moment is going to be more entertaining.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.560]   So I'm doing that because it's more entertaining
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.400]   than this other thing.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.440]   And I have it with me all the time,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.420]   so I'm going to default to the more entertaining option.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.080]   The other common explanation behind super distractions
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.280]   is brain rewiring.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.240]   I took the substance, maybe it was I drunk enough,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.800]   or I began using a particular drug,
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.160]   and now my brain fundamentally rewired
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.480]   to have a sort of craving for this
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.000]   in the same way you would have a craving for oxygen,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480]   and it's essentially unavoidable.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.960]   There are truth to both of those explanations.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.520]   They're not wrong, but they are also incomplete.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.040]   And we know this because of some of the counter examples
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.580]   that exist when we look closer at super distractions.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.480]   Let's take digital super distractions.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.880]   I studied this in depth for my 2019 book,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.320]   "Digital Minimalism."
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.600]   I talked to over 1600 people.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.560]   I ran this study with 1600 people who were struggling
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.920]   with the role of their phones in their lives.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.040]   And one of the interesting points that came out of this,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.920]   it was not this phone is more interesting to me
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.980]   than these other things.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.940]   It is why am I avoiding things that I know
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.640]   are more meaningful and enjoyable and more valuable to me?
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.620]   Why am I avoiding these things to look at this screen?
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.520]   There was a sense of bewilderment
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.720]   among the people I talked to
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.000]   about why they would take their attention away
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.760]   from their young child during bath time
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.160]   to look at something mundane on Instagram,
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.400]   or they would avoid a sunset that would fill them
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   with awe and peace to comment on something on Twitter.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.120]   So the on the ground reports of digital super distractions
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.640]   was this isn't better than the other things
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.280]   that are in front of me right now.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.320]   This is why I'm upset.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.220]   I'm taking time away from really good things
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.500]   to look at this thing that's not so good.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.160]   So the utility maximization argument cannot be complete.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   We see something similar,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.360]   especially when we talk to more
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.400]   substance-based super distractions.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.320]   Ioann Harari has this interesting book
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.120]   called "Chasing the Scream"
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.040]   that looks deeply at substance addictions.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.760]   And one of the points that he makes in this book,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.280]   which stuck with me,
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.840]   is he says the way we think about things like opioids,
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.000]   like heroin, the way we were taught to think about these
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.760]   is just the substance itself being in your body
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.720]   will rewire your brain
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.820]   so that you are hopelessly addicted to it.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.720]   The way I was raised in the '80s and '90s
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   was if, and this is a Harari example,
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.080]   if a mad scientist kidnapped me,
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.800]   strapped me down and injected heroin into me,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.500]   I would leave the mad scientist den a heroin addict.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.360]   But Harari makes this interesting point in the book.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.760]   You know, in England, where he's from,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.600]   we give heroin to grandmothers all the time.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.800]   When you go in to get knee replacement surgery
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.880]   or hip replacement surgery,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.120]   which is incredibly common if you're older,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.780]   we use Demerol is what the UK NHS was using,
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.860]   which is just a medical-grade heroin.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.860]   So we're giving grandmothers heroin all the time,
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.160]   but they don't come out of the hospital
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   addicted to heroin.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.020]   So there's something deeper going on here
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.600]   than just some substances.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.960]   If you ingest them, maliciously rewire your brain,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.240]   and now you can't avoid seeking out those substances.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.200]   So what else is going on here?
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   A big part of the answer is the quieting of psychic pain.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.760]   So psychic pain is a really distressing feeling
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.420]   of discomfort that is coming from your emotional
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.260]   or psychological state, not from your physical body.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.580]   So it's not a physical pain,
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.700]   but it is a mental or psychological pain.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.840]   It involves, for example, anxiety.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.040]   It could involve, for example,
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.060]   unhappiness with yourself or your life.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.740]   This overlaps quite strongly with shame.
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.960]   It could be grief or loneliness.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.160]   It could be hopelessness,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.040]   the sense of nothing's gonna get better about my situation.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.620]   Those are all very painful sensations.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.200]   And there's a reason why they feel bad,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.400]   because of course they are maladaptive.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.960]   The reason why they're so distressing
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.120]   is that in our evolutionary history,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.060]   when we felt these feelings,
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.740]   our brain was supposed to be incredibly motivated
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.720]   to make a change.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.480]   Why does anxiety feel so bad?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.200]   Because 150,000 years ago,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.460]   anxiety was typically related to
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.120]   something bad was about to happen.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.800]   And it was really distressing.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.560]   So your brain would say, "Stop everything else.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.480]   "I think something really bad is gonna happen.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.320]   "Oh yeah, you're right.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.340]   "Like our food is out and there's a saber-tooth tiger.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.800]   "Let's try to fix that situation so we're not eaten.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.840]   "Let's say you're really unhappy
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.580]   "or feeling shameful 150,000 years ago."
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.800]   And your brain is saying, "This really matters,
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.340]   "because we live in a tribe of seven
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.720]   "and we all have to cooperate
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.000]   "to not get stomped on by mastodons.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.720]   "We need to do something about this."
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.560]   And in that context,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.640]   there's probably something you could do.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.960]   I'm gonna go do something heroic
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.580]   or try to win back the praise of my tribe.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.380]   So in our history, these feelings were very distressing
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.160]   because they would push us to do things
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.000]   that would help us pass on our genes.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.840]   But of course, in the modern context,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.120]   none of this is relevant anymore.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.200]   The sources of these feelings are not the sources
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.600]   that we originally were adapted to respond to.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.320]   And we have all sorts of different responses
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.280]   that did not exist in our evolutionary history.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   So they've gone from being adaptive to maladaptive.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.200]   So how does this connect to super distractions?
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.800]   Well, here's what ends up happening.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.560]   You have a source of psychic pain,
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.860]   no obvious way to treat it
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.600]   in the way we might have in a tribe 150,000 years ago.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.820]   You begin using one of these super distractions
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.620]   as a way to temporarily quiet that psychic pain.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.560]   Your brain then makes the association,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.340]   this activity helps with this psychic pain.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.020]   Psychic pain is very bad.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.060]   So we're really now into this activity
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.540]   that quiets that psychic pain.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.940]   This is now the thing we need to do.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.580]   And once your brain decides that this activity
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.820]   is how we make this unbearable psychic pain go away,
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.480]   it makes it very difficult not to do that activity.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.000]   Now the brain's motivational centers, the dopamine centers,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.460]   they all get fired up to make you pursue that activity
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.080]   because your brain is very into making pain go away.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.480]   And this is not just a craving, it is also,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.140]   and this is something who don't deal with these issues
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.100]   don't often understand, it is a distress
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.660]   in the absence of these activities.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.580]   Someone who doesn't struggle with alcohol abuse,
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.220]   for example, doesn't realize it's not just,
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.900]   I really wanna have a drink,
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.420]   it's when you're not having a drink,
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.100]   you feel increasingly distressed and anxious about it.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.060]   Your mind is saying,
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.820]   this is the thing that helps the bad thing.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.420]   Why aren't you helping the bad thing?
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.500]   And it becomes very difficult not to do it.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.140]   Same thing when social media
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.900]   becomes a source of emotional numbing.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.580]   It's like, this is what I go to,
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.140]   and because it presses buttons,
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.460]   because it's engineered to press buttons
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.860]   that are unrelated to my particular psychic pain,
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.420]   it's like putting ice on a sore knee
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.540]   and that pain kind of goes away.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.100]   I can numb for a little while.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.440]   Once your brain learns that,
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.660]   you feel very uncomfortable
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.100]   when you're not just looking at your phone.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.180]   It's not just this craving,
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.020]   I really wanna see what's happening on TikTok.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.700]   It's this, I don't feel good not looking at my phone,
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.620]   and it becomes a super distraction.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.900]   Same thing happens to young men with online pornography.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.060]   It's this weird distress.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.820]   Your brain wants something to numb or go away.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.020]   This is how we do it.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.500]   This then is what we need to do.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.420]   That is the source of super distraction.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.780]   There's often this big aspect
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.900]   of once your brain learns it numbs psychic pain,
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.620]   it puts all of its resources at making you do that behavior
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.520]   and feeling bad if you're not doing that behavior.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.000]   All right, so then once we recognize this,
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.860]   what does this tell us about taking control?
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.700]   Hey, it's Cal here.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.300]   I just wanted to mention,
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.940]   if you wanna have help taking action
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.540]   on the type of ideas we talk about in this show,
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.940]   sign up for my email newsletter.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.740]   The link is right here below in the description.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.280]   Two to four times a month,
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.320]   I send out detailed articles
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.500]   about the types of ideas we discuss here.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.460]   It's the best way to stay connected
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.780]   to me and my audience's quest to live a deeper life.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.740]   So sign up below.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.540]   From super distractions.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.900]   Well, what we need to do
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.080]   is find alternative treatments for psychic pain
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.220]   that your brain can learn to love.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.700]   Once it gets these alternative treatments for psychic pain
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.180]   that it can focus on,
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.580]   then the grip on the super distractions weakens.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.340]   So white knuckling it, quote unquote detoxing it
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.460]   in the absence of anything else is not a very effective
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.420]   because your brain says the psychic pain is still there.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.260]   It's bad.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.300]   Go back and do the thing that makes it go away.
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.620]   If you can develop an alternative way
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.360]   of dealing with the psychic pain,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.660]   then your brain says, okay, that's fine.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.500]   Fair is fair.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.300]   We'll do this other one now.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.580]   And it's almost as if the demon on your back
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.740]   that was pushing back to your phone,
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.640]   back to your phone, back to your phone,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.020]   back to the bottle, back to the bottle.
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.320]   It's like that power is suddenly diminished.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.380]   I mean, we can see some classical case studies of this
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.260]   from sort of recent figures.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.300]   There's an interesting memoir, Rich Roll,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.900]   the podcaster Rich Roll has a cool memoir
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.180]   called "Going Ultra" or "Finding Ultra."
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.860]   You know, it's an interesting story, right?
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.220]   So Rich Roll, if you don't know about him,
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.100]   he grew up here in the DC area.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.820]   His dad was a lawyer in Bethesda,
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.140]   went to Langdon private school in the DC area.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.140]   Really good swimmer, D1 swimmer at Stanford
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.620]   developed the alcohol problem.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.880]   And it became pretty bad,
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.500]   especially once he was done with athletics.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.260]   He developed it, by the way, if you read the story,
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.340]   the deal with there's a lot of stress and anxieties
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.920]   and psychic pain based on his like incredible athletic,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.220]   what was required to be an athlete at that level
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.020]   and the realities of how far he was gonna get.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.260]   And it was all, he had difficulties.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.780]   And so it was an alcohol abuse followed.
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.140]   He finally got off the alcohol abuse
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.380]   by replacing it with food abuse.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.540]   Similar thing, eating like a lot of junk food
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.900]   can release a chemical that you can then trigger onto it.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.600]   Like this is the thing I need to make my pain go away.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.960]   Right as he approached mid age,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   he replaced this with a commitment
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.560]   to these ultra endurance athletic events.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.280]   He talks about in this book.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.400]   As a different way of dealing with the psychic pain.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.160]   And his mind then turned over to that.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.040]   So, okay, this is what we're doing.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.440]   The alcohol abuse was gone, the food abuse was gone.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.200]   From there that blossomed into a bigger commitment
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.280]   to healthy living.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.520]   He got very into veganism and then moved on
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.280]   from just doing ultra endurance events
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.080]   to creating his podcast, which is all about
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.360]   trying to help other people live more meaningful lives.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.160]   But anyways, how did he get away
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   from these super distractions in his life?
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.440]   He got away by replacing them with something that was better.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.120]   We see story after story about this.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.240]   Be it Cheryl Strayed hiking the Pacific Coast Trail
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.680]   as a way to get over the grief induced
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.820]   drug and alcohol abuse.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.680]   Or go back 1500 years and we get Saint Augustine
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.240]   living his hedonistic life in North Africa.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.080]   And through religion completely having something else
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.380]   to heal the pain that he was feeling before.
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.840]   So how do we do this then?
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.920]   Let's get tactical.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.600]   So we have super distraction, I'm on my phone too much.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.800]   Pornography, maybe too much alcohol.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.840]   But every time you try to cut back you find it difficult.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.800]   If we're gonna replace these super distractions
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.040]   with a better source of helping with your psychic pain,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.920]   how are we gonna do that?
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.840]   Let me give you four steps.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   Step number one, we gotta redefine your image of yourself
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.880]   as someone who is disciplined.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.540]   As someone who has the capability of doing hard things
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.880]   even if it's not immediately gratifying.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.040]   And the best way to get there is to come up
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.380]   with a few daily disciplines that are not trivial
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.560]   but are also tractable.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.400]   They should cover a few different areas of your life.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.680]   Probably something health and fitness,
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.840]   probably something work related,
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.520]   probably something intellectual or spiritual related.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   And you just start marking that on your whatever planner
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.640]   or notebook you use.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.000]   You just start marking every day,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.760]   did I do these three disciplines?
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.000]   They should be tractable.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   They're not super hard but they're also not trivial.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.640]   Even just that for a month is gonna begin to rewire
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.440]   your conception of yourself as, oh, I can when needed
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.480]   do things that have a long-term value.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.820]   I do have discipline.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.040]   You're changing your identity.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.720]   Then you need an organizing meaning for your life,
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.960]   the structure of your life around.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.100]   This is what's gonna come next
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.400]   after you've redefined yourself as someone with discipline.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.820]   You're gonna need probably a religious
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.920]   or philosophical framework to commit to.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.100]   Here the word of advice I'm gonna give is practicing.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.880]   Most philosophies and especially most religions
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.180]   are built to be revelatory through action,
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.360]   not through cognition.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.280]   It's not I sat here and I read all about Buddhism
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.840]   and I've decided that this sounds right.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.240]   And until I convince myself it's right,
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.200]   I'm not gonna do it.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.060]   No, it's meant to go do these practices.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.600]   And it is through the actual actions
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.500]   that you have the revelatory insight about,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.320]   oh, what is true and what is effective or not.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.360]   So you need an organizing structure framework
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.560]   and you have to live it.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.040]   Don't just study it, live it.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.160]   You don't know anything about it
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.520]   until you've actually done it.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.460]   Most of these ancient ideas are built around action.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.780]   They're not based around just linguistic investigation.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.580]   You have some sort of organizing framework for your life.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.380]   And don't overthink this, you can change it.
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.780]   The binary that matters here is the difference
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.960]   between no structure or framework for values in your life
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.100]   and some structure or framework for values in your life.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.060]   You can change it, but you don't wanna be
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.640]   in the first option of having nothing.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.960]   All right, step three.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.440]   Now it's time to do some resets.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.080]   You imagine you have discipline,
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.200]   you have an organizing framework for your life.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.040]   This is what matters.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.840]   I'm doing these practices to commit my life
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.760]   to these things that matters.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.460]   I have some moral clarity there.
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.520]   Now you do some reset.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.940]   Let's reset how you organize all the junk in your life.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.260]   How do I keep track of tasks and work and my calendar
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.820]   and all my information for my banking?
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.720]   How do I plan?
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.400]   Am I using multi-scale planning?
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.900]   How do I keep track of what's going on?
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.780]   How do I triage if I have too much on my plate
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.320]   or not enough on my plate?
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.980]   Do I owe taxes or how am I doing my financials?
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.040]   Systematically, I do not want stuff hanging.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.740]   I control stuff.
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.280]   I control stuff on my terms.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.000]   You wanna reset your approaches and goals and work.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.460]   What's going on in my job?
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.300]   Where do I wanna get?
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.960]   Let's do some lifestyles and a career planning maybe.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.980]   Let me get more organized.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.160]   Let me get on the ball.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.400]   Let me start actually delivering
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.600]   what I'm saying I'm gonna deliver.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.520]   Let me be reliable, let me be organized.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   Let me systematically cultivate some deep work
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.460]   so the work I do is at a higher caliber.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.940]   You get that dialed in.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.960]   And then finally you reset entertainment distraction
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.960]   and leisure in your life.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.680]   What do I actually wanna do with my time outside of work?
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.320]   Which technologies do I need?
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.200]   I'm not gonna bring a technology into my life
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.720]   unless there is a really good explanation for why I need it.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.120]   And if there's a really good explanation
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.480]   then I'm gonna put rules around it
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.920]   to get the value and avoid the cost.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.860]   I'm not just gonna randomly have TikTok in my life
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.000]   because someone somewhere had some scenario
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.600]   in which maybe a post would help a business one day.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.480]   Now you gotta earn your way into my life
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.080]   and most technology is not going to.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.160]   You replace the cheap stuff with the better stuff.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.400]   Here's what I do, I read every day and here's when I read.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.560]   And I go for these thinking walks in the evening
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.600]   after I shut down work.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.760]   And I don't use any of these social media services
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.200]   but I get my news from over here.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.080]   And once a week I check these people on Instagram
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.840]   but that's the only time I use it.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.600]   I'm gonna start watching good movies on Fridays.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.780]   In fact, I'm gonna go through the AFI top 100.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.520]   I'm gonna do that for the next 100 weeks.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.560]   You get on top of what is it that I'm laying to my life
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.260]   when it comes to leisure and entertainment.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.280]   And you dial that in as well.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.720]   And this is gonna be much easier to do now
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.320]   because you've already reinvented your identity as yourself
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.480]   as a disciplined person.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.480]   You already have now committed through practice
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.080]   to a organizing framework for meaning in your life.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.400]   And this is a foundation
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.080]   on which to start building these resets.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.300]   And then finally, step four, pursue a remarkable goal.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.320]   So you have something like Rich Roll
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.840]   training for his outlandish ultra endurance events.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.100]   You have something that you're turning your energy to
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.220]   and coming back to again and again.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.420]   So when times get tough in the moment, you say,
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.860]   yeah, but I have this bigger thing going on
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.220]   that I wanna succeed.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.340]   And so I'll go through what's hard right now
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.940]   or I'll endure what's hard or I'll endure this distraction
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.100]   and keep coming back to what I think is important.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.200]   So you have something pulling you forward.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.300]   So redefine yourself as disciplined,
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.140]   find an organizing structure for your life,
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.400]   reset organizational systems, work
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.060]   and entertainment decisions
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.760]   and then pursue a remarkable goal.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.620]   Now you're in a better situation.
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.280]   Now you have the upper hand on the super distractions
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.100]   because everything I just described to you here
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:24.100]   is gonna give you a solid human response to psychic pain.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.940]   It is you recognizing
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.940]   if you are approaching your life this way,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.440]   you can recognize and deal with psychic pain.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.060]   And you have outlets for dealing with it
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.940]   that are sustainable
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.700]   and that actually amplify what's important
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.060]   about your humanity instead of squashing it
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.180]   or putting it down or trying to protect it from yourself.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.460]   It's an alternative your mind and body can get on board.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.300]   They say, I have no interest in looking eight hours
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.740]   just at my phone.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.860]   I no longer need the four drinks every night
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.500]   as a way to kind of just numb my anxiety.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.780]   I have these other things
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.700]   that are helping me respond to my anxiety
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.180]   and this actually feels deeper.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.380]   This is deeper aligned to me.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.740]   Now if those four steps sound a lot like the deep life stack
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.340]   it's because they basically are.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.340]   We come back to good ideas again and again on this show
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.500]   and we adapt them as needed.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.540]   And basically we're applying those ideas
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.500]   to this notion of super distraction with some tweaks here.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.740]   Very few original ideas,
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.620]   deep life stack is sort of at the core of this
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.780]   but this is the big thing I want you to take away.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.300]   Is psychic pain demands treatment.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.260]   And if you don't develop a good treatment for it,
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.820]   you're gonna end up treating it one way or the other
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.900]   and it's probably not gonna be the way that is sustainable.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.460]   It might be a way that will ultimately destroy you.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.060]   Now of course the final caveat here,
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.020]   all of these things can get pushed to extremes
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.540]   that need more serious response.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.580]   So if it's not just,
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.300]   ah, I keep having drinks and more than I want,
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.500]   I hate being hung over.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.380]   If it's beyond that,
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.020]   if you have a major alcohol abuse problem
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.580]   then you need professional help
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.220]   with addiction recovery there.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.420]   This is a substance that crosses the blood brain barrier.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.060]   It can be very difficult to deal with.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.300]   If you have a major alcohol problem
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.980]   you probably need major professional support
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.180]   so let's throw in that caveat.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.620]   Similar, if the psychic pain
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.460]   for which these various super distractions
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.380]   are being palliative towards,
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.460]   if it's incredibly intense to the point
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.980]   where it is really getting in the way
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.820]   of your day-to-day life,
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.620]   you need professional help for that as well.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.420]   So it's not just I'm sort of anxious
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.140]   and I'm going on my phone all the time
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.540]   or I'm not happy with what's going on in work
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.740]   so I'm trying to distract myself or numb myself.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.940]   If it's, you know, I'm canceling things,
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.340]   I can't get out of bed, I'm feeling a hedonic,
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.940]   feeling a sense of pervasive hedonic hopelessness,
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.340]   well then there's professional therapy
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.540]   that is meant to do exactly,
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.140]   deal exactly with those extremes as well.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.180]   So we'll throw in those caveats.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.260]   Psychic pain gets really bad, bring in professionals.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.540]   Substance abuse gets to a really bad point.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.340]   We've dealt with this as a site before
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.020]   and there's very strong addiction recovery resources
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.660]   to use here, but for most people,
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.180]   they're on this too much,
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.020]   drinking more than they would like.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.860]   The young man's looking at pornography all the time
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.540]   and feeling all the shame for it.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.140]   There is a psychic pain here that you can deal with,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.260]   you can deal with in a healthier way
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.300]   and you might be surprised by the freedom you discover.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   You can take back control of your life
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.260]   from super distractions.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.620]   You just have to get to the real source of the problem
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.620]   if you wanna have a positive impact.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.420]   So there you go.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.380]   That's a cool book, that Yohan Harari book,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.820]   "Chasing the Screen."
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.060]   - So that's the same Harari that wrote--
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.100]   - "Stolen Focus."
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:35.940]   - Okay.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.780]   - Yeah, same one.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.820]   So Harari has written three contrarian books,
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.580]   "Chasing the Screen,"
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.180]   and the main argument in "Chasing the Screen"
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.660]   is basically what I was talking about here,
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.780]   that addiction is a highly active substance
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.140]   plus beginning to connect using that substance
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.300]   to escape pain.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.260]   So you can take a bunch of painkillers after a surgery
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.780]   and then stop taking and be fine.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.660]   But if you start associating the painkillers
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.700]   with like, this is making me feel better
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.540]   about my hopeless economic situation,
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.180]   then you get this Titan loop where your brain says,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.580]   oh, this is how we get rid of that pain?
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.900]   We have to have the drugs.
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.180]   So that's where it was an interesting book.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.660]   Then he wrote a book about depression
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.700]   that also had some contrarian take,
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.300]   that it was saying by focusing too much
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.660]   on just the biological explanations
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.900]   that got real big in the '90s,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.260]   you have a chemical imbalance, let's just fix it.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.420]   He was saying we underplay these lifestyle elements
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.580]   that treatment for depression,
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.900]   his argument should be like this incredible intervention
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.620]   in like all the details of your life to make,
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.220]   like often it's almost like a logical response
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.300]   to a real hopelessness that you could respond to
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.900]   by making your life less hopeless.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.780]   And he has all these stories about in certain countries,
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.700]   that's how when people are dealing with that,
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.540]   the response is like,
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.700]   well, let's help you get your business going again.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.540]   So it was kind of contrarian.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.460]   And then "Stolen Focus,"
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.940]   he's trying to be contrarian about distraction and argue,
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.820]   I don't know it well, I have to go back and reread it,
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.540]   but he has some contrarian arguments there about ADHD
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.820]   and is this really,
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.260]   is this caused actually by new technology
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.460]   and not just a completely unrelated brain thing that changed?
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.260]   So that's what his thing is he does.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.340]   He's sort of like contrarian looks at,
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.980]   I guess, psychological related issues.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.780]   - Yeah. - Interesting guy.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.780]   All right, so we've got some questions
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.100]   that are roughly on these topics
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.980]   as well as a case study to get into.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.900]   First, I wanna briefly mention one of the sponsors
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.780]   that makes this show possible.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.580]   And that is our good friends
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.620]   and my bed's good friends, Cozy Earth.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.860]   Cozy Earth bedding, these are the sheets that we use
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.140]   and 100% absolutely love.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.220]   We bought multiple pairs so that when we clean our sheets,
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.100]   we have another pair of Cozy Earth sheets to put on.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.900]   For a while, we only had one pair and it was terrible
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.660]   because there was the bad weeks and the good weeks.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.820]   And there was such a difference
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.580]   between like our perfectly normal sheets
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.940]   and the really good Cozy Earth sheets
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.900]   that it was almost depressing
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.060]   to get to the in-between weeks.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.260]   So we bought more pairs of the Cozy Earth sheets
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.900]   so we would never be without them.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.300]   I never really thought about bedding until we got these
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.860]   and they are fantastic.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.940]   I really, really like them.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.940]   There's some, it's made out of viscose, viscose bamboo,
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.900]   which is a type of fabric, I guess,
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.660]   that traps less heat so you can sleep cooler
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.740]   and more comfortably year round, which I care about.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.260]   But I just noticed they just feel really, really good.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.460]   I really do love these sheets.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.440]   They were also Oprah's favorite things five years in a row.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.280]   So both Oprah and Cal Newport endorse these sheets.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.700]   So there you go.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.300]   They are offering, what does Cozy Earth have for you?
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.320]   Oh, they're offering that if you do not agree
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.540]   that sleeping on them is fantastic,
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.500]   they will refund your purchase price plus shipping
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.820]   with no questions asked.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.860]   They will give you 100 nights to try them out.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.500]   And if you don't like them,
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.380]   they will give you back your money, but you will like them.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.700]   I can guarantee that for you.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.020]   All right, they also have a discount for you.

[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.420]   I also wanna talk about our friends at Blinkist.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.540]   Blinkist is a subscription service
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.700]   that offers you short reviews,
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.300]   summarizing the main ideas
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.420]   of over 5,500 nonfiction books and podcasts.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.340]   Most of these summaries can be read or listened to
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.240]   in just 15 minutes or less.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.380]   The way that Jesse and I use Blinkist
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.420]   is as a triage service for the books we read in our lives.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.100]   If we're interested in potentially reading
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.820]   a nonfiction book, the first thing we'll do
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.900]   is add that to a queue in Blinkist.
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.820]   Then we get around to it,
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.740]   we will either listen or read the blink,
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.320]   which is what they call the short summary, on that book.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.380]   And I'm telling you, getting the summary of the main ideas
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.700]   for an accomplished nonfiction reader
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.580]   almost always tells you exactly what you need to know
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.580]   about whether this is a book worth buying or not.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.280]   In some books, you say, okay, I've got the main ideas.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.380]   I can see how this book's gonna unfold.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.740]   It's just gonna gloss on these three A ideas a bunch of times.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.460]   I'm glad I know these ideas, I'm not gonna buy the book.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.140]   Other times, you'll read or listen to the blink
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.020]   and say, oh, this is fascinating.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.540]   Like, I wanna go deeper on this,
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.300]   and you buy the book with confidence.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.060]   So it makes your success rate with buying a book
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.640]   and subsequently loving the book,
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.560]   that success rate goes way up if you are using Blinkist.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.740]   They also have a special feature right now
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.280]   called Blinkist Connect,

[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.900]   getting two for the price of one.

[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.700]   All right, let us move on now to some questions.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.540]   Jesse, what do we have first?
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.100]   - First question is from Tracy.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.880]   I set a big goal in life and eventually achieved it.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.900]   After six months, my life started to take a downturn
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.220]   as I fell into a comfy zone after hitting my goal.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.900]   How can I escape the comfort zone
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.740]   when I don't know what goal to set next?
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.100]   - Well, Tracy, there's a common problem here,
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.660]   especially among high achievers,
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.660]   which is if you've oriented your life exclusively
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.780]   around these sort of big ambitious goals,
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.380]   and sometimes these are professional,
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.260]   but sometimes they are,
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.180]   they're actually leisure goals is common too.
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.880]   So, you know, training for a marathon
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.280]   or some sort of athletic event that's really difficult.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.160]   If your life is oriented exclusively around these big goals,
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.600]   you are gonna run into the problem you're talking about now,
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.500]   which is the down period between them.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.360]   I mean, for some people in particular,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.080]   I'm thinking about the big wave surfer, Laird Hamilton,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.440]   his wife, Gabby Reese, will talk about his lows
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.400]   between the highs of the big wave season.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   So there's a season.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.340]   In the lows between the seasons,
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.940]   he'll fall essentially to a depression
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.020]   because he doesn't have this like, we're out here,
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.700]   we're surfing, we're fulfilling our goal.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.060]   The downtime can be really difficult.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.780]   So what's the solution here?
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.900]   Well, it's unsustainable if all you're doing
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.060]   is pursuing big things
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.580]   because you can't always have big things to pursue.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.460]   And at some point in your life, no one bats a thousand,
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.740]   you're gonna have a couple of big things
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.020]   that fizzle in a row.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.100]   And that's where really the hammer comes down
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.020]   for high achievers.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.100]   That's where they really fall into a funk
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.400]   where this project didn't work and this thing fell apart
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.720]   couple in a row.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.880]   If this is what you've oriented your life around,
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.760]   then you'll find yourself completely adrift.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.860]   What you really want is a deeper foundation,
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:30.080]   a deep life foundation that is sustainable and meaningful
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.900]   from which you launch your big ambitious goals.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.320]   If this is a sustainable enough foundation,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.800]   you are fine in between goals,
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.080]   or you're fine if a couple of goals in a row fail
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.720]   because you have this deep foundation
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.880]   that's plugging into the things
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.380]   that are important to you in your life,
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.820]   making sure that your life in general
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.720]   is structured around what you care about,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.960]   whether you happen to be pursuing a big goal
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.300]   at that moment or not.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.360]   So a good place to start is just the layers
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.840]   of the deep life stack.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.080]   You can just go back to the deep dive
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.340]   that we just finished a couple of minutes ago
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.040]   and look back at the layers I talked about,
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.760]   disciplined and building a framework of values,
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.680]   then resetting and organizing the big parts of your lives.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.720]   Remember the last layer,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.440]   only the last layer there was pursuing something remarkable.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.960]   So maybe go back and check out those three layers,
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.600]   really get that souped up and get comfortable with that
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.260]   before you launch your next big thing.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.760]   That's gonna make pursuing the big things more interesting,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.980]   more fulfilling, less stressful, less anxiety producing.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.600]   You're gonna be able to find more pleasure
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.360]   in the process itself of the pursuit
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.120]   and less of an obsession with the outcome
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.400]   because you don't need that outcome to feel good.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.360]   You feel good because you have these disciplines
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.260]   built into your life,
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.680]   because you've reoriented your life
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.000]   around a framework of meaning
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.980]   with real practice and rituals in there,
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.040]   because you have reset and reorganized
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.880]   the aspects of your life that connect to things
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.760]   that really matter to you on a regular basis.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.760]   So whether or not this huge professional project
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.640]   succeeds or not, is not that vital.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.000]   You're finding value in the fact
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.200]   that you're pursuing the project.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.760]   And then when it's done,
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.880]   you're also gonna be fine for a few months in between.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.920]   I'll mention finally, Tracy,
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.640]   this is something that comes up in my book,
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.800]   "Slow Productivity" that's coming out in March.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.980]   It's second principle of slow productivity
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.500]   is work at a natural pace.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.300]   And I profiled these traditional famous knowledge workers
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.300]   from time past that all had this up and down rhythm.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.860]   There's periods where they're working intensely
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.580]   on something and long periods where they're not,
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.780]   and it comes up and it comes down.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.340]   And when we zoom out to the period
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.520]   of the 30, 40 years of their professional life,
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.600]   we just add up these cool things they finished.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.740]   But when we zoom back in,
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.180]   we see there's periods where they're really into it
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.700]   and there's periods where they're barely touching it.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.700]   And there's this sort of natural give and take ebb and flow.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.660]   So this natural pace is what we're wired for.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.140]   And I think having that deep foundation,
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.240]   deep life foundation from which you're launching
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   these particular goals is gonna make it much easier
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.380]   to have this more sustainable natural pace.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.620]   All right, so work on that,
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.540]   get that dialed in before you launch your next big project.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.300]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.300]   Next question is from Tyler.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.660]   Does dopamine fasting actually work?
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.820]   I'm afraid that if I stop seeking dopamine entirely,
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.400]   I could become depressed.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.740]   - So I guess this is a thing right now, Jesse,
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.520]   dopamine fasting.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.660]   Does this basically mean,
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.580]   and maybe we should look this up,
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.540]   but does this basically mean like cold turkey detox?
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.940]   Like I'm gonna just stay away from the distractions
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.500]   that are hijacking my dopamine system.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.740]   - It's probably similar to like food fasting.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.980]   - Yeah, and by doing that, I'll like lose that drive.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:38.820]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:43.260]   I'm not a huge fan of dopamine,
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.920]   if that's what it is, Tyler.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.620]   My issue is dopamine fasting by itself
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.300]   has a real chance of not working.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.940]   And I think our best reason for understanding that
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.860]   is the deep dive that we just finished.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.500]   So a lot of times, again, and very brief summary,
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.140]   but the super distractions that really plague us,
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.140]   the me on my phone all the time,
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.300]   me and my pornography all the time,
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.440]   me drinking too much or eating too much junk food,
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.060]   the super distractions that really plague us
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.540]   are often plaguing us because our mind has decided
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.860]   this is my primary response to some source of psychic pain,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.860]   anxiety or unhappiness or shame about your place in life,
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.880]   hopelessness, grief, et cetera.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.860]   So if that's why,
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.060]   if that's the driving force with a super distraction,
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.740]   cold turkey net is a risky move
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.780]   because your mind says,
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.460]   "I will not tolerate the psychic pain."
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.260]   So just saying, I'm gonna rip away from you
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.300]   the thing that helps with the psychic pain
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.660]   and we'll just white knuckle it,
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.300]   by which I use that term to mean
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   you're just holding onto the table really hard,
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.500]   so hard that your knuckles turn white,
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.920]   that's probably not gonna succeed.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.420]   Your brain says, "No, I win.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.920]   "Pain is bad.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.720]   "We need to do something."
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.940]   Now you might get lucky
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.900]   and you might stumble into an alternative thing
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.660]   your mind latches onto and that's better,
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.140]   but I say, why wait to be lucky?
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.800]   Why not be much more intentional about it?
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.580]   So to me, it's not really about
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.420]   starving your dopamine system,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.960]   but reaiming it at something more sustainable.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.460]   Your dopamine system is only involved
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.340]   in these super distractions
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.740]   because your brain really wants to make sure
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.900]   that we do something about the psychic pain.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.780]   So let's give it something better to do.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.460]   And that's gonna require a deeper life,
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.900]   a foundation of depth that actually is sustainable
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.460]   and then rebuilding discipline and values
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.580]   and getting in control and resetting parts of your life
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.500]   and then rebuilding these more meaningful things
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.380]   to do with your time,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.300]   these more meaningful responses
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.820]   to the inevitable psychic pains.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.260]   And then your dopamine system's no longer your enemy
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.260]   because it says, "Ah, this weird behavior
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.100]   "of staring at the phone,
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.220]   "we have other ways to deal with this now."
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.960]   So I don't think it's necessarily bad,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.240]   but I don't know that it's gonna work
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.180]   and I think it might generate needless pain.
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.660]   If you really are suffering, you just say,
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.380]   "Let me just stop looking at my phone."
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.900]   And you change nothing else.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.060]   Could be difficult.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.380]   It doesn't have to be that difficult
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.380]   once you understand what the underlying mechanisms
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.360]   actually are.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.980]   All right, ooh, a third.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.740]   Is this a third T in the row we have coming up here, Jesse?
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.580]   - Yeah.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.400]   - I like it.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.180]   Tracy, Tyler, and Tanya.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.660]   What do we got here?
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.740]   - All right, next question is from Tanya.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.740]   "I find my inner voice very cruel
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.700]   "and I struggle with negative thoughts.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.840]   "Do you have any advice on how I can overcome these
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.380]   "on a daily basis?"
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.560]   - So Tanya, this is a very common thing.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.540]   I'm gonna start with that.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.700]   I think this is misunderstood about mental health issues
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.660]   from people who don't suffer from them
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:45.340]   is how often the common source of the mental health issues
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.040]   is these inner voices.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.860]   So psychologists will call this negative rumination.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.860]   It's a voice in your head
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.900]   that is constantly pointing out negative things.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.980]   So for anxiety, the negative ruminations
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.940]   are those looking to the future with concern.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.100]   What about this, what about that?
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:01.940]   What if this doesn't go well?
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.980]   What if this disaster happens?
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.000]   What if, you know, it's looking to the future
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.940]   and constantly pointing out things that it's worried about.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.980]   For depression, it's the same voice.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.140]   It's just often looking to the past.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.460]   Why did you do that?
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.060]   Oh my God, that was the wrong thing to do.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.740]   You're so worthless.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.180]   People are thinking about that.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.300]   I'm sure people are talking about it.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.060]   No one, look at that event.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:22.940]   That guy who snubbed you,
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.660]   yeah, it's because no one respects you.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.020]   So it's just looking back at your life so far,
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.580]   like a, you know, upset movie critic,
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.620]   just pointing out everything that went wrong.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.700]   That's why there's such a connection
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.180]   between anxiety and depression.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.020]   They go back and forth.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.380]   It's your ruminative voice,
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.500]   and it's just kind of where it's aimed.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.340]   And once that voice has a really strong foothold
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.780]   in your head, it's got a real comfy chair,
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.220]   and it knows that, oh, I'm gonna be listened to.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.060]   Then it can change its, you know, themes,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.620]   but it's in there screwing around with your brain.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.060]   And that's why we often find
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.780]   those two particular mental health issues
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.180]   so tightly intertwined.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:58.460]   So it's a very common, well-understood issue.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.020]   I think of it a lot like knee pain.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.300]   You know, it's, ah, I have this thing.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.140]   It's really common.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.980]   It's really annoying.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.020]   I should do something about this
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.420]   because otherwise, it makes my life really hard right now,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.460]   and my knee hurts, but also because it hurts,
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.820]   it's making me walk differently,
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.620]   and I might get like even bigger problems going forward.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:16.580]   Let's get it treated.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:17.540]   And that's the right way to think
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.860]   about overwhelming negative ruminations.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:20.700]   Your knee is hurting you.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.980]   It's time to get it fixed.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.340]   There is a lot of good approaches to fixing rumination.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:32.820]   In particular, second wave and third wave psychotherapy
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.580]   are essentially focused like a laser
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.540]   on ruminations and how to dissipate it.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:42.620]   With first wave psychotherapy, which is talk therapy,
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.900]   the Freud-influenced therapy and analysis,
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.260]   this is what people think about from Woody Allen movies
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.620]   and is talking about your kids
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.340]   and your childhood and your life.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.820]   Second and third wave psychotherapy
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.020]   are much more evidence-based,
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.220]   and it says we need to tackle ruminations.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.820]   So second wave psychotherapy
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.420]   is, if I'm understanding my history correctly,
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.620]   and I hope I'm getting my terminology correct,
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:05.740]   second wave psychotherapy is defined most notably
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.780]   by cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.300]   This is where you directly address ruminations
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.940]   and point out the distortions in the thinking.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.520]   You give names to the distortions.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.400]   You separate yourself from the rumination,
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.160]   and you try to diffuse their power.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.280]   Tanya, if you're looking for an introduction
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.520]   to second wave psychotherapy,
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.760]   the proper book to look at is titled "Feeling Good,"
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.400]   big bestseller from either the 1970s or the 1980s
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.320]   that walks through all the principles
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.120]   of cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.520]   Third wave psychotherapy is best defined
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.880]   by ACT, acceptance commitment therapy.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.920]   It's similar.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.680]   Again, it's rumination-based,
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.600]   but here it has more of an Eastern-motivated approach
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.860]   of noting all the negative ruminations,
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:59.660]   not resisting them, but also not entertaining them,
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.480]   and persisting with committing
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.500]   to useful value-driven behavior regardless.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.960]   So it's a sort of diffusing of,
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.520]   it's just this thing that's,
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.880]   there's this voice, and I have a name for it,
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.540]   and I have a name for the character,
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.320]   and he's just in there doing all this chatter,
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.160]   and I sort of like, okay, I'm good to see you there,
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.320]   but I'm gonna go on and do this thing
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.360]   I think is important.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.320]   So you see like ACT, for example,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:26.200]   ACT is very effective for anxiety-related issues,
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.560]   panic attacks, for example,
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.520]   where it's like, well, yeah, bad things could happen,
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.000]   but this stuff matters, I'm just gonna go forward with it.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.480]   Cognitive behavioral therapy tends to be very good
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.640]   for more of a negative rumination
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.440]   on your sort of depressive ruminations.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.080]   So you can intervene, it's like, no, that's stupid.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.440]   Not everyone was embarrassed by me,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.120]   and the fact that that guy said this thing
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.040]   at the meeting doesn't mean that everyone thinks I'm dumb.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.000]   So CBT is very good for that backward-thinking rumination.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.680]   ACT is very good for forward-thinking rumination.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.400]   It's like, that stuff could happen, probably won't,
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.120]   but I'm gonna live my life, and you get used to it.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.720]   So they have different approaches.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.720]   If you're looking for the good consumer,
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.220]   public-facing book on third-wave psychotherapy,
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.600]   look at "The Happiness Trap,"
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.640]   which we talked about in a recent book as well.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.460]   So, Tanya, buy those books first.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.600]   See which of these resonates more with you.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.000]   And I would read both of these books
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.520]   and see which of these resonates more
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.560]   with your particular brand of rumination.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.480]   It's possible that just the ideas in these books themselves,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.880]   you start doing the exercises
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.560]   and you immediately see improvement.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.240]   This happens with a lot of people.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.080]   If you're not seeing improvement immediately,
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.000]   then you get a professional therapist involved.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.840]   What do they do?
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.480]   They're professionals that are administering
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.160]   these evidence-based ideas on minimizing rumination.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.720]   They're the brand equivalent of the knee doctor.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.060]   The reason why I'm suggesting you buy these books first
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.700]   is that when you're looking for a therapist,
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.980]   now you know what type you're looking for.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.380]   And so if you're dealing with negative ruminations
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.500]   on your past and CBT really resonates,
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.180]   then you're looking for a cognitive behavioral therapist.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.140]   If you're dealing with anxiety and forward-facing ruminations
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.980]   and the ideas from ACT are resonating,
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.220]   then you look for a therapist
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.380]   that says they're an ACT practitioner.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.320]   So now you can be kind of selective in who you're choosing.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.900]   One of our sponsors, for example, BetterHelp,
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.200]   is an easy way to get involved in professional therapy
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.520]   that's cheaper and more flexible
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.860]   than trying to find someone who happens to be open nearby,
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.560]   but maybe you also just know of someone nearby.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.400]   But this is what I would say.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.240]   Take this seriously.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.520]   What you're facing is incredibly common,
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.120]   but you do want to get on top of it.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.960]   We have a lot of tools to get on top of it.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.680]   Learn the tools, and if needed,
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.320]   find a professional to help you administer them.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.600]   All right, let's do another question, Jesse.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.640]   - Next question's from Mark.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.280]   "I have a good routine in place for my deep work.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.440]   "My desk is cleared from all documents,
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.940]   "same for my computer.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.980]   "I set out exactly what I want out of the session
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.320]   "and how long it should take.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.080]   "I then do a loop around the inside of the building twice,
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.280]   "clearing my head while listening to binaural beats.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.420]   "I then do two minutes of breathing exercises outside.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.120]   "Then as soon as the door opens, it's showtime.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.040]   "My problem is shower work.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.360]   "When I block off even to do specific shower work,
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.840]   "my mind wanders all the time,
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.160]   "and I find it difficult to get things done.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.360]   "Do you do anything ritual-wise before shower work?"
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.180]   - Well, first of all, I like this deep work ritual.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.020]   - Yeah.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.840]   - What do you have?
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.020]   Okay, let's summarize.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.000]   Clean desk, clean computer desktop,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.120]   lay out a plan for the deep work session,
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.540]   what I'm gonna do and how long it's gonna take,
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.540]   a loop around the inside of the building twice
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.480]   while listening to these,
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.340]   I don't know what this was either, binaural beats.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.280]   - I think it guys are from Huberman.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.960]   - Oh, okay, excellent.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.660]   So it's probably a specific,
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.400]   what's this, like a white noise type thing?
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.240]   - Yeah.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.280]   - Okay.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.560]   Two minutes of breathing exercise outside,
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.960]   and then opens the door and goes into work.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.840]   Cool deep work ritual.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.600]   We talk about these all the time.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.360]   Deep work is unnatural,
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.960]   and so we have to sort of trick our brain
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.960]   into wanting to do it.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.960]   So having a really multimedia, multi-sensory,
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.880]   highly repetitive ritual
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.140]   that comes right before deep work,
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.620]   eventually your brain builds
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.780]   this automatic reflexive connection
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.620]   that you finish this ritual,
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.100]   and it's ready to execute.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.020]   So it's a good question,
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.580]   should we be doing something similar for shallow work?
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.780]   And I think it's a good question
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.700]   because I think we don't treat shallow work
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.520]   with enough respect,
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.460]   at least from the standpoint of cognitive preparation.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.660]   Now, something we've been talking about
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.300]   more and more on this show
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.800]   is the cost of loading up a cognitive context
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.560]   and how this is difficult and takes time.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.740]   So like before you're doing deep work,
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.840]   one of the reasons why these rituals are helpful,
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.880]   like Mark just talked about,
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.080]   is not just because it reflexively puts your mind
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.520]   into a deep work mode,
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.920]   but you're clearing out,
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.040]   you're giving your brain time
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.080]   to clear out unrelated old cognitive context
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.960]   and load up the context of the work you're about to do.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.840]   Part of what's effective about this ritual then
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.920]   is that Mark reviews everything he's gonna do
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.720]   at the beginning of the ritual,
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.200]   initiating the loading of that context,
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.400]   and this ritual takes enough time
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.280]   that he can start clearing out the context
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.680]   of whatever email or Zoom nonsense
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.000]   he was doing right before the deep work session.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.600]   And the ritual is all activities
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.160]   that aren't gonna trigger other types of context as well.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.360]   It's listening and walking
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.360]   and nothing that's related to work.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.740]   And so part of why this deep work ritual is effective
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.440]   is that he shows up loaded from a brain perspective
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.760]   to do exactly that work.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.800]   Now, I think a shallow work
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.640]   often requires those contexts as well,
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.480]   but we don't treat it with the same respect.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.760]   So it might seem like the most shallow thing in the planet
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.160]   that I'm gonna answer emails.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.080]   This isn't deep work.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.640]   I'm not writing the great American novel,
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.760]   I'm answering emails.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.240]   But from a cognitive standpoint,
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.440]   each of those emails has this complicated
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.120]   social professional context
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.400]   that you need to fully load
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.080]   to figure out how to carefully word your response.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.920]   And if you just haphazardly just jump in
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.880]   and start typing emails,
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.280]   your brain's like, I am not ready for this.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.360]   And then when you switch to another email
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.080]   from a client that's completely unrelated
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.920]   to what you were just doing,
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.360]   your brain plays the comic break squealing sound,
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.240]   like, wait a second, we're not ready to do this either.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.080]   And you feel that real resistance.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.760]   And I think that's what Mark is pointing out here.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.680]   It's because you don't have the right stuff loaded up.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.880]   You're trying to force information out of your brain
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.200]   that it's not ready to do.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.880]   And so this is a good time to declare
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.400]   that for certain types of shallow work,
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.560]   yeah, let's ritualize some of that as well.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.580]   So for email, let's start with that example.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.500]   Let's take your email inbox,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.940]   and I'm gonna give you a ritual right now.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.820]   Let's go through the single threading exercise
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.020]   we talked about earlier in the show.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.140]   Break up the emails
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.380]   into different cognitive context subject matters.
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.200]   If you're using Gmail, you can label and archive them.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.660]   So they're all with a common label.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.240]   By the way, here's another hack on that.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.540]   You don't have to actually give content specific names
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.940]   to these labels because there could be over time,
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.880]   dozens and dozens of different relevant cognitive context.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.040]   Just label them context one, context two, context three,
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.940]   context four, context five, up to context 10.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.780]   It doesn't matter what the names are.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.280]   It's just you have some way of, okay,
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.340]   oh, there's a bunch of emails about this very specific thing.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.740]   I'll call that context three.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.020]   So do that, right?
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.060]   So figure out like what are the different topics
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.900]   I have to answer in my inbox,
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.780]   label them, put them together, and get them all out of sight.
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.940]   Now you can say, what am I gonna tackle first?
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:28.760]   Context one.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.380]   Now I'm gonna do the two laps in the building
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.340]   I did before my deep work.
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.500]   But now the point of these two laps is to begin
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:40.100]   loading up the relevant circuits for context one.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.940]   And just think in your head while you're walking,
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.340]   okay, these emails are all about a conference
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.300]   that's coming up.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.780]   Let's start thinking about the conference,
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:47.600]   what's going on.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.700]   Let me get that context loaded.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.380]   You sit down at your desk, load up just that context,
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.020]   boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, answer those emails.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.020]   All right, what's context two?
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.860]   I'm up, two laps around the building.
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.820]   Switching to that context, starting to think through,
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.460]   okay, these are all emails about a project.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.620]   Where am I on the project?
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:06.020]   You know, what do I really need to do here?
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.140]   You know what, we're really behind.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:09.420]   I think maybe we need to do a more drastic reset.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.840]   Start thinking about it as a way to get the context shifted.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.860]   Do a couple laps around the building, sit down, boom,
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.060]   email, email, email, email.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.980]   So why don't we do the same type of rituals
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.460]   around this particular shallow work task?
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.300]   I like that.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.060]   Let me give you another shallow work ritual
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.700]   'cause I'm on a roll now, Mark, I like your idea.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.700]   I've got a Zoom meeting.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:28.840]   All right, well, here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.580]   I'm gonna put that Zoom meeting on my calendar
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.860]   and I'm gonna put 20 minutes
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.060]   after that Zoom meeting on my calendar right after.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.860]   As soon as I put that meeting on my calendar,
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.500]   I extended that appointment by 20 minutes.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.140]   And so as soon as this meeting is over,
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.140]   I'm gonna write down all my notes
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.460]   and I'm gonna just walk and think about that meeting.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.780]   Laps around the building, walk around the block.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.780]   All right, what just happened there?
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.060]   What do I really need to do next?
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.860]   You know, maybe, was that really a good idea?
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.380]   Are we missing some information?
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.640]   What are the right steps here?
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.340]   Actually, I should not do those steps and just talk to Paul
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.700]   and like, we probably need to just,
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.100]   this is gonna be a longer conversation
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.740]   and maybe we, you just start thinking about it.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.820]   You're loading, you know, you're thinking about it.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.920]   You're trying to make sense of it.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.680]   You sit down and you send out the emails,
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.340]   you update all your to-do lists, you go on your calendar.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.720]   You're like, this is great, this is all out of my mind
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.320]   and I still have 10 minutes left.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.980]   Now I can just reset.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.260]   All right, what's next?
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.460]   So we have a ritual there following shallow work
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.460]   to process all the details, close all the loops
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.020]   and give your brain a breather.
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:34.820]   So again, a shallow work ritual that could be important.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.100]   I'll give you one more as long as we're thinking about it.
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.900]   What about physical tasks?
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.500]   I gotta get this thing from the store and mail this letter.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.300]   Put those all together.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.660]   Say, great, I put these all together.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.900]   I have a whole hour.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.460]   I'm listening to, you know, I have a book I'm excited
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.420]   to listen to on tape and I'm just gonna use this
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.500]   almost meditatively, just have this big list.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.060]   I'm gonna start checking things off while I'm here.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.500]   I'll go to this store, then I'll go to that store
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.780]   and just sort of feel this feel of just physical progress
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.500]   of tasks being checked off your list
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.340]   while you're listening to an interesting book or something
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.540]   and make that into a whole organized ritual
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.440]   of I'm now in task mode and I'm really leaning into it.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.100]   So I think the bigger point here, Mark,
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.980]   which you've sparked in me, which I'm liking,
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.940]   is this notion that shallow work can be
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:21.500]   as cognitively demanding as deep work in certain aspects,
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.780]   in particular, when it comes to the complexity
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.260]   of the context surrounding different types of shallow work.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.340]   So having some rituals that respect that
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.840]   might make the same shallow work seem much easier.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.860]   So we shouldn't be dismissive about shallow work.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.300]   Well, that's just something you can do whenever
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.180]   and it's easy and all I care about is the deep work.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.860]   I really need to care about my mind.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.180]   We gotta care about our minds for everything we do
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.640]   in the knowledge for context, deep and shallow combined.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.220]   All right, so what I wanna do now
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.140]   is actually read a case study.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:53.440]   So sometimes listeners send in case studies
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:57.140]   of their experience using the type of advice
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.540]   we talk about on the show.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:04.380]   So this case study comes from Mishia and I will read it.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:09.380]   So Mishia says, "I read Digital Minimalism six weeks ago
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.740]   "and immediately started an electronic detox.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.320]   "I did not have social media before,
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.760]   "but I used to watch YouTube, Netflix and Disney Plus
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.220]   "while cooking, cleaning and sometimes for leisure.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.360]   "I used to complain that I had no time at all.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.900]   "I was struggling to get things done at work.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.160]   "I was not able to focus to finish
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.380]   "my data science certification bootcamp.
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.620]   "I was not able to spend quality time
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.580]   "with my 12 year old son.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.980]   "I was not getting enough sleep.
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.420]   "When I started the 30 day detox,
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.420]   "I noticed that I was able to focus more.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.760]   "I enjoyed spending time with myself and my thoughts.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.340]   "I was able to read and replicate
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:42.620]   "some machine learning papers.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.060]   "And most of all, I was fully aware of the present
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.780]   "and improving my relationship with my son.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.520]   "Signify distractions such as YouTube
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.860]   "and streaming services gave me myself back.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.100]   "My thoughts and my alone and silence time.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.660]   "I always enjoyed silence, but maybe
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.080]   "because the fast paced society,
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.360]   "I felt I needed to subscribe to these streaming services.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.460]   "At the end of the 30 days,
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.060]   "I was able to finish my data science certification.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.020]   "I am currently sleeping eight to nine hours every night.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.440]   "I spend much more quality time with my son.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.780]   "I was able to read four books
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.500]   "and my brain is not hungry for dopamine anymore.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.360]   "I mean, sometimes I wanna just lay down
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.220]   "and binge on something.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.660]   "So I always have my Kindle with me.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:18.560]   "And when I feel this way,
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.900]   "I purchase a thriller mystery science fantasy
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:24.600]   "and fiction or fiction book and I get to read.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.640]   "I rediscovered the pleasure of reading.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.100]   "I was so impressed how little changes
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.480]   "can actually make a huge difference.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.380]   "Thank you so much, Cal.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.380]   "I cannot thank you enough."
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:35.260]   Well, Mishia, that's a really cool story.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.260]   And I wanted to read it because it emphasizes the people.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.820]   We don't always realize the impact
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.820]   of these super distractions on our life.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.740]   We think like, yeah, I look at my phone
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:47.820]   and have some streaming services,
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.100]   but that's just kind of like in the background
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.260]   and in downtime, it's not a major shaper
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:54.380]   of my experience of the world, but it is.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.580]   Because it becomes something you come back to,
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:01.240]   to escape or to get away from these sources of psychic pain,
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.020]   be it anxiety or hopelessness or grief or whatever it is.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:08.420]   And they become this background numbness in your life
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:09.740]   that takes you away from other things.
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.380]   We're used to this from the substance abuse community.
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:16.020]   Talk to a big drinker about life after drinking.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.740]   They tell it's like taking the limitless pill
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.500]   from that movie, right?
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.620]   Where it's like, oh my God, I have so much time and energy
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.780]   and there's all these things I can do.
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.440]   And they didn't realize how much of their life
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.020]   was feeling inebriated or recovering from drinking
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.940]   and what a big impact it was having on their life
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.860]   until they took it away.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.140]   And people report the same thing about digital distractions,
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:37.700]   just like Mishia did here.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.600]   Her life is so much richer now.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.060]   She's doing the things she knows are better.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.220]   And because of that, her life is much better.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:46.780]   This goes exactly to the deep dive
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.660]   from the beginning of this show.
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.340]   I'm sure if we push closer, there is difficulties
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.020]   that were being numbed or dealt with
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.180]   by all these digital distractions in Mishia's life.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:00.660]   She now has other things, explicit alternatives
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.620]   to deal with that psychic pain,
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.260]   this sort of pursuing time with her son,
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:10.160]   reading, working on stuff that's important for her career.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.580]   Once she was able to inculcate these new activities
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.340]   by using the digital declutter suggestion
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.900]   from digital minimalism, once these alternatives,
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.740]   more humane and sustainable,
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:22.540]   these deeper sources of meaning were in place,
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.620]   then the cheap stuff was no longer so appealing
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.020]   and her life is much better.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:30.900]   So I think that's a good case study.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.580]   I love this idea that she thought she had no time.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:36.460]   Then she realized she actually had all the time
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.300]   in the world.
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.340]   It was just a matter of controlling who got access to it.
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.780]   So Mishia, I like that case study.
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.020]   Hopefully you've motivated some more people
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.180]   to go through some sort of transformation.
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.860]   So you can look in digital minimalism
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.940]   and there's a whole program in there
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.880]   specifically for digital distraction
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.420]   or go through the deep life stack we talked about earlier.
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.700]   But if you are finding more and more,
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.940]   your life is caught up in these super distractions,
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.680]   it's time to take back control.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.780]   Mishia did it.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.320]   I think you can do it as well.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.260]   All right, so we have a final segment coming up.
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.980]   I wanna react to a piece of news I found interesting.
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.620]   First, I wanna briefly mention another sponsor
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:17.080]   that makes this show possible
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.340]   and that is our friends at Ladder.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:26.660]   Sorry, I was just looking.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.100]   I was having a moment there where I was pondering.
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.260]   I'll tell you what, I was just pondering
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.380]   in that moment of silence right now.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.980]   Do I have enough life insurance?
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.360]   I was so distracted by that question
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.140]   that it distracted me from the ad I was reading
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.820]   and you might be the same way.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.440]   Life insurance is one of these things
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.500]   that anyone who has people who depends on them,
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.420]   kids, a spouse, et cetera, often feel anxious about.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.980]   I know I don't have enough
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.300]   or maybe I don't have any at all
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:58.300]   or I have some small policy through my company
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.700]   that's not gonna do anything,
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.740]   God forbid, if something terrible happens.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.860]   It's a source of anxiety because it's just hanging there
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.660]   and why don't we deal with it is because it is ambiguous.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.380]   How do I go get life insurance?
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.060]   It sounds like a hard thing.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:15.180]   It sounds like Flo from the insurance commercials
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.860]   or the guy with the red shirt has to come to your house
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.060]   and give you a shot or something
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.820]   or listen to your heart with a stethoscope.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.780]   We don't know, how do you do this?
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.300]   How do you get life insurance?
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.860]   That is where Ladder enters the scene.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.740]   It's 100% digital.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:32.460]   There are no doctors, no needles and no paperwork
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:35.020]   if you're applying for $3 million in coverage or less.
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:38.940]   You just answer a few questions online in an application.
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:42.040]   You need just a few minutes on a phone or laptop to apply.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.800]   Their smart algorithms will work in real time
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.540]   so you'll find out if you're instantly approved.
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.020]   No hidden fees, cancel anytime, get a full refund
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.920]   if you change your mind in the first 30 days.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.140]   These are good policies.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:54.020]   These are policies insured by insurers
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.180]   with long proven histories.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.220]   We're talking about insurers that are rated A or A+
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.560]   by AM Best.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:08.020]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.720]   to see if you are instantly improved.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:14.720]   That's L-A-D-D-E-R, life.com/deep,
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.640]   ladderlife.com/deep.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.300]   We also wanna talk about our friends at Mint Mobile.
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.580]   Mint Mobile is the first company
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.920]   to sell premium wireless service online only,
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.600]   which saves a lot of money
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.440]   and allows them to pass those savings along to you.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:38.220]   With Mint Mobile, you can order a wireless plan from home
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.980]   and save a ton of money.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.240]   We're talking about phone plans
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.700]   that start at just $15 a month.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:48.840]   That could be $100 or more less per month
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.980]   that you are paying for phone service.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.900]   They get this so cheap because they are online only
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:58.860]   so they don't have to deal with expensive retail stores.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:02.240]   For example, they can pass those savings directly to you.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.200]   All their plans come with unlimited talk and text
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.560]   plus high-speed data delivered
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.280]   on the nation's largest 5G network.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.760]   We were talking about Mint Mobile.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.680]   I was talking about it recently.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.720]   I've been giving a talk at my kids' schools
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.440]   about phones and kids,
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.600]   and I brought in my $45 phone I bought on Amazon
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.160]   that has its wireless service through Mint Mobile
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:27.080]   because the parents were wondering,
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.900]   how can I give my kids access to text messaging
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:32.020]   without having to buy them an expensive iPhone
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:33.620]   and $100 a month plan
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.660]   and all the bells and whistles that are on an iPhone?
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:38.540]   And I said, just buy a phone off of Amazon like I did.
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:40.820]   Get a Mint Mobile plan, $15 a month.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.260]   They send you the SIM card in the mail.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.360]   You just stick it in.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.220]   Now they have a phone.
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.440]   They can text you.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.540]   They don't need the ability to play Roblox
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.860]   on landscape mode on some sort of fancy device.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:56.860]   So I was pitching Mint Mobile to parents at my kids' schools
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.140]   just within the last couple of weeks.
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.480]   So to get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.320]   and to get the plan shipped to your door for free,
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:07.000]   go to mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.200]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.480]   Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.540]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.840]   All right, for our final segment,
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.880]   I wanna go back to something
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.800]   that we haven't done in a little bit, Jesse,
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:26.180]   which is our classic CalReacts.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.400]   Take a bit of news that I saw or someone sent me
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.640]   that I thought was interesting and that we could talk about.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.760]   So the news I wanna talk about today,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.080]   I'm bringing up on the screen here.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.680]   And I should mention, if you're listening
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.660]   and wanna see what I'm talking about,
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:43.040]   just go to the deeplife.com/listen, episode 270.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.880]   The videos are at the bottom.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.720]   So the article I wanna talk about
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.260]   was published in Neiman Reports.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:54.260]   So Neiman is the study, it's a journalism school.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.820]   So Neiman Reports is about the media business.
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.140]   The title of this article is,
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:04.060]   "Six Months Ago, NPR Left Twitter.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.820]   The Effects Have Been Negligible."
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.620]   Well, you could already tell I'm happy about this one.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.780]   All right, let's read the subhead here.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.460]   "The numbers confirm what many of us have long suspected,
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.260]   that Twitter wasn't worth the effort,
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:19.240]   at least in terms of traffic."
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.780]   I'll read a little bit from this piece
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:22.620]   and then we'll talk about it.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.460]   All right, here's a little bit more.
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:25.940]   "A lot of people threatened to leave Twitter.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.360]   Not many of them have actually done it.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.580]   But last April, Twitter gave NPR a reason to quit.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:35.820]   It labeled the network, US State Affiliated Media,
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.180]   a designation that was at odds
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.300]   with Twitter's own definition of the term.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.300]   NPR stopped posting from its accounts on April 4th.
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.000]   A week later, it posted its last update,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.540]   a series of tweet directing users to NPR's newsletters,
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.000]   apps, and other social media accounts.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.520]   Many member stations across the country,
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.220]   including KUOW in Seattle,
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.460]   LAist in Los Angeles and Minnesota Public Radio,
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.860]   followed suit.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.580]   Six months later, we can see the effects
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.300]   of leaving Twitter have been negligible.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.820]   A memo circulated to NPR staff says,
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.100]   "Traffic has dropped by only a single percentage point
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.420]   as a result of leaving Twitter."
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.500]   All right, I bring this up because this is something
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.520]   I've been arguing for a long time now,
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:21.960]   which is we give Twitter in particular,
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.320]   and social media more generally,
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.380]   we were giving it way too much credit.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:29.000]   There is this idea out there,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.520]   like you have to be on Twitter.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.040]   This is where news breaks,
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.640]   it's where people learn about the world,
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.760]   it's how people find out about you and what is going on.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.440]   NPR's experience says that's not true.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.600]   And it turns out the people who were really pushing this
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.440]   were people who were addicted to Twitter, right?
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.580]   It's like the people who your friends at the bar
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.700]   who get really mad when you say,
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.740]   "I'm gonna stop drinking."
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.020]   Like, "This is, what do you mean?
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.860]   Like, this is fun.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.860]   This is like where everything happens.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.620]   This is where all the socialization happens."
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.100]   There's a lot of this was happening around Twitter.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.060]   Was it really important for this news organization
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.620]   to be tweeting out their stories?
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.320]   No, it wasn't important to their mission.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.580]   They have reporters, they know what's going on in the world.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.700]   They do radio reports,
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.380]   they publish things on their own website
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.220]   that they can control.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.240]   They have podcasts,
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.160]   they have email newsletter subscriptions
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.700]   that they can control.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.960]   And that is perfectly reasonable way
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.500]   for them to distribute the news and it works fine.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.680]   And their traffic didn't budge.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:23.320]   Because again, Twitter is heavily used
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.920]   by a small number of addicts.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.520]   There's a slightly larger group of people
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.960]   who like to watch the car crash
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.760]   and then everyone else doesn't care.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.400]   But it seems so important
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.440]   because a lot of the people in that first circle
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.960]   also happen to be big personalities,
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.240]   they're journalists, they're media personalities.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.760]   And so they give this sense of,
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.400]   because to them it's where everything's happening,
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.400]   but it's not really.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.120]   It's not really.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.740]   So if this is true for Twitter,
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.300]   think about for your own life.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.540]   I mean, if it's true for NPR,
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:51.980]   that's like major news organization
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.860]   leaving the social media home of all news
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.220]   and everything was just fine,
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.300]   ask yourself the question,
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.100]   what would happen if you did the same?
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:01.820]   And you could, I know the excuses.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.460]   This is where I'm gonna learn about the world.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.900]   It's not, there's a lot of source of news.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.780]   You can learn about the world and everything that's going on
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.740]   even with a little bit of fact checking involved first
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.980]   without having to be on Twitter.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.420]   Today's where I'm gonna meet interesting people.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.580]   Hey, guess what?
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.000]   You can meet interesting people who are not on Twitter.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.920]   And the very fact that they're active on Twitter
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.340]   probably means they're not that interesting anyways.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.460]   You say, well, this is where I learn about
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.980]   like really interesting ideas.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.820]   Guess what?
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.680]   There's a lot of ways to learn
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.180]   about really interesting ideas.
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.080]   So I wanna generalize this NPR example to more people.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:35.820]   These services are not as vital
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.060]   to the functioning of our civic life,
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.260]   our personal lives, the media landscape.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.800]   They're not as vital for all these things
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.760]   as we told ourselves.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   It was this period of social media totalitarianism
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.060]   that we're just coming out of
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.900]   where it felt like there was no other option
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.780]   but to be subservient to these services.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.200]   And I think we're realizing that's not the case.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.380]   And we're leaving that thinking.
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.980]   And I think this is an important piece of it.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:02.860]   I mean, I wrote in deep work, 2016,
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.380]   right in that book, I said,
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.900]   this decision by the New York Times in 2015
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.980]   to tell their reporters
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.940]   you need to be using Twitter is wrong.
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.280]   And it was last year that they circulated a memo
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.840]   and said, we actually don't really want you using Twitter.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.680]   It was wrong.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.820]   Do your thing, do your thing really well.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.160]   You probably don't need to be on these services.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.060]   And if you do be there with care.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.520]   Anyways, it just made me happy, Jesse,
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.240]   to see that I just,
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.720]   I have dealt with this my entire career.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.900]   You're crazy.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.320]   You have to be on these services.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.400]   And it's because the people who write about these services
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.400]   are all on them and addicted.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.520]   They just can't imagine life without them.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.740]   A major news organization left and nothing happened.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.460]   Look at all the wasted cycles of all of those reporters
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.620]   spending so much time like on Twitter
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.140]   and battling with people on Twitter
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.460]   and trying to get their tweets up
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.500]   and how it influenced their reporting and all.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.380]   They could have just avoided all of that.
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.060]   They had just read deep work and been like,
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.100]   yeah, we're not gonna do this.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.940]   They'd be heroes.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:04.560]   All right, I wanna end with just something fun.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.340]   So the reader who sent in this article, Matthew,
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:12.380]   also sent me some photos from a bookstore he came across.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.260]   I just wanted to show a photo because it's cool.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:19.260]   This is a train station that they converted to a bookstore.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.640]   And I love that.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.120]   So I've loaded on the screen here
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.040]   for those who are watching,
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.380]   just a pleasant thing to leave us with,
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.900]   an image of a train station
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:32.060]   that has been transformed into a new bookstore.
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.440]   I love this type of thing.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:36.240]   By the way, not to nerd out on bookstore stuff,
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.740]   but if you're seeing this image online,
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:41.280]   you're looking at the shelf that I'm showing here.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.900]   It's predominantly face out.
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.660]   That's a cool move.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.940]   More and more bookstores are doing this.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.140]   Ryan's Bookstore does this in BossDrop
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.580]   where it might be less inventory,
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.100]   but more curated inventory,
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.700]   and you have much more face out shelves.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.860]   You can see the books face out.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:58.700]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.260]   Anyways, nothing makes me happier
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.880]   than to see cool bookstores in cool places.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.660]   The more bookstores, the merrier.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.420]   So Matthew, thanks for sending that along
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:08.820]   and good for whoever built that bookstore
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.060]   in the train station.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.340]   Good on you.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:13.840]   All right, so that's all the time we have for today.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.400]   Thank you for listening or watching.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.740]   If you're a listener and you enjoy the show,
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.060]   please leave a review, please subscribe.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.580]   That helps iTunes tell more people
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.980]   and Spotify tell more people about the show.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.880]   And I do want more people to find out.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.060]   Otherwise, we will be back next week with a new episode.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.980]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.100]   Hey, if you liked this video,
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.740]   I think you'll really like this one as well.
