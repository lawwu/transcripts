[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   The following is a conversation with Chris Duffin,
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.460]   the mad scientist of strength.
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.480]   He's one of the strongest people in the world,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.920]   but is also an engineer of some of the most
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.720]   innovative strength equipment I've ever seen.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.440]   Check out his company Kabuki Strength.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.360]   He's the only person who squatted and deadlifted
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.940]   1,000 pounds for multiple reps
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.880]   and achieved many other amazing feats of strength.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.840]   He has lived one hell of a life of hardship and triumph
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.040]   as he writes about in his book called
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.480]   "The Ego and the Dragon."
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.400]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.680]   Headspace, Magic Spoon, Sun Basket, and Ladder.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.580]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.840]   As a side note, let me say that I was always
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080]   a fan of strength, both powerlifting
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.080]   and Olympic weightlifting, both as a fan and practitioner.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.520]   Mostly I'm a fan of people who are willing
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.400]   to put in years of hard work towards finding out
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.360]   what the limits of their body is
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.000]   and then smashing past those limits.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.600]   People like Chris Duffin or on the Olympic weightlifting
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.100]   side, people like Dmitry Klokov.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.480]   That guy's great.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.620]   This is why I love watching the Olympics,
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.860]   both the heartbreaks and the triumphs.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.140]   They all reveal the incredible heights
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.880]   that the human mind and the human body can reach.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.960]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.220]   and here is my conversation with Chris Duffin.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.120]   You've been a part of several incredible feats of strength.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.240]   Which was the hardest or maybe one you're most proud of?
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.260]   - Definitely the one I'm most proud of
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.840]   is that journey for the grand goals.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.240]   It was like a five-year scope that I chased this.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.160]   And so when you think about training,
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.240]   it took more than five years, obviously.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.940]   By that point, I'd been training for over 25 years.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.360]   But it makes me proud.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300]   I mean, there was three distinct things
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.840]   that I wanted to accomplish out of this.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.960]   So it was really thought out.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   And this was kind of my exit from being a competitive lifter
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.080]   and basically saying, hey, I'm gonna be an Instagram lifter
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.680]   and an exhibition lifter or whatever.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.440]   I've done this for 16 years.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.640]   I was number one in the world for like eight years straight,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.720]   all-time world records.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.200]   And I'm like, I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   What I wanna do is just something deep down to me
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.440]   that is really important.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.820]   And there's three things that we're driving
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.680]   this and this is a five-year journey
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.600]   that I went through to do this.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.340]   I really wanted to showcase that you could do something
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.880]   that is well beyond the scope
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.940]   of what people think is humanly possible.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.940]   So just this inspiration thing, this grand over the top,
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.600]   like if you set your mind to a single-minded goal,
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.640]   you can go so much further.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   And I didn't even say what the goal was up front
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.520]   because it was so far out there,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.760]   I would have been laughed at.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.740]   I think big goals should be kept pretty damn close
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.440]   to start with for that reason too.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.300]   And then the second piece was to walk the walk,
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.040]   to show the principles of what I believed in
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.280]   around human movement,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.260]   the ability to manage and control the spinal mechanics
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260]   and the output that can have on the body.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.780]   And so I wanted to take the two most basic movements
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.540]   that every able-bodied person should be able to do.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.360]   So fundamental movement patterns, the squat,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.140]   which is like in the developmental approach
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.620]   is around nine months as a baby
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.620]   from a developmental kinesiology standpoint
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.940]   and a really basic pattern
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.980]   that every able-bodied person should be able to master.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.660]   The other one being the hip hinge,
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.420]   being able to pick something up off the ground, a deadlift.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.960]   And I wanted to do those two, not just one,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.220]   because I wanted to show the principles
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.420]   that I wasn't built for one.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.140]   I wasn't a specialist because of my lever links,
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.580]   torso links, all that, any outliers,
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.620]   because nobody had ever done a thousand pound squat.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.720]   So this is it, and a thousand pound deadlift.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.140]   It was outside of the scope of what anybody's,
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.540]   there's like half a dozen people that have done one
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.180]   or the other, but nobody's ever done both.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.780]   And I wanted to do something unique.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.260]   I wanted to do them, not only do it,
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.500]   but do them for reps to leave literally
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.420]   no question out there.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.860]   And there's no competition for that.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.780]   So it was, this is what I'm gonna go do.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.660]   And to pull it off, I had some past issues
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.940]   with my elbows and stuff that I couldn't work around.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.620]   So I had to wear straps, which was another reason
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.980]   I couldn't do it in the competition setting.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.520]   So the first year I worked up
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.260]   and I did a thousand and two pound deadlift.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.600]   We plates were weighed afterwards.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.060]   It was a couple, a little bit over,
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.860]   and I did it for almost three reps.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.820]   And that still stands as a Guinness world record.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.500]   Just the one rep does,
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.020]   is the most weight ever sumo deadlifted.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.460]   And one other person has deadlifted a thousand
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.700]   for reps at this point, and that was Thor Bjornsson
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.540]   from Game of Thrones.
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.020]   He's done a thousand for a double as well.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.620]   So then the next four years,
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.300]   and I did a bunch of feats of strength on the way,
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.760]   but it was all about building that axial loading capacity,
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.420]   the strength that, 'cause now I'm moving the weight
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.500]   from my hands up to my shoulders.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.680]   And so to do it for reps is like so much harder
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.600]   than a single, like five to 10 seconds
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.020]   versus 30 plus seconds to be able to buffer
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.020]   and manage all that with that kind of load is just crazy.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.620]   - It's literally about the duration
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.820]   that your body is carrying the load.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.300]   - Yeah, that's a big part of it.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.220]   Yeah, because you have to,
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.220]   you're using the resource of the diaphragm
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.580]   for stabilization.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.460]   And so it's also responsible for respiration
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.300]   and all this other stuff.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.540]   So even when you're not squatting,
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.180]   you've got to be handling those loads.
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.500]   - Just holding that weight is fascinating.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.460]   It's like, it's fascinating that the human body can do that,
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.040]   can maintain that structure,
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.900]   just everything working together,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.460]   that the biology, the skeletal structure,
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.020]   the musculature on top of that can hold the weight.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.180]   It's fascinating to watch.
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.080]   - Everything is very intentful about positioning
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.140]   and how you're creating pressure and all this sort of stuff,
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.980]   especially for me.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.460]   So when I mentioned that half a dozen people have squatted it
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.360]   and half a dozen people have deadlifted it,
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.900]   you understand those people all weigh 380 to 440 pounds.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.300]   I weighed 265 to 285,
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.940]   depending on where I was between the two.
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.540]   So there's that as well, right?
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.640]   So big, big difference.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.780]   And over the course of that,
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.980]   I did a lot of other feats of strength
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.820]   that fit in that capacity and we can skip over those,
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.260]   but that was hugely invested as far as, you know,
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.580]   what I put into being able to accomplish that.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.120]   'Cause it's over the top,
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.500]   which means the other stuff had to shift
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.320]   and I had to learn some,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.040]   there's so many things that came into place
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.300]   to pull that off.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.800]   And so, yeah, last March,
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.600]   two days before the world shut down, I did it.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.720]   It was supposed to be at the largest equipment exhibition
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.880]   in the world down in San Diego as an event.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.120]   And that got shut down a week beforehand, obviously.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.260]   So we moved to, let's do it in my gym and invite people.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.260]   And that was on a Saturday and Thursday or Friday,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.260]   they limited it to 25 people for gatherings.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.320]   I did it on Saturday and then Monday, everything shut down.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.900]   So it was kind of surreal for timing wise, right?
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.120]   And so if I hadn't done it, it would have never got done.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.220]   Like, 'cause I'd pushed to the limit.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.700]   I couldn't come back and do it.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.220]   It was at the total limitation of my capabilities.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.140]   So I'm pretty proud of it.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.840]   Oh, and the last piece was,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.400]   every one of these feats along the way,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.600]   I collaborated with a charity that I believed in.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   And there was a lot of those tied to my life story,
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.160]   which we probably will get into.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.800]   So it was threefold.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.820]   So that inspiration piece, inspiration, motivation,
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.680]   walking the walk and showing, like,
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.560]   just these methodologies that a guy
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.320]   that had to learn to walk again
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.520]   can do something like this with no back pain.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.200]   There is a way.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.640]   And the third one is to provide awareness and recognition
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.360]   around a lot of key charities.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.200]   - So your heart was in this journey, but also your mind.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.480]   It's just, you're like a scholar of strength,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.160]   a scientist of strength, an engineer of strength.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.980]   For reps, do a thousand pounds of squat and deadlift.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.200]   Let's first talk through the actual day you did it.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   What does it take to lift that much for reps?
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.300]   - The day of is really easy.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:41.840]   The lift itself, other than a few seconds,
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.920]   is really easy and not challenging.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.100]   People always ask me, what was it like?
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.200]   How beat up were you after that and the deadlift?
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.280]   And the simple fact is it was easy.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.500]   The work to get there was horrendous.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.680]   - So even the psychology of the day,
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.080]   you weren't, there was not a fear,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.520]   there was not a nervousness,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.680]   there was not a doubt in your mind?
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.840]   - There was certainly doubts on that day
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.700]   from some training history.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.360]   So there was some major breaks to my confidence
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.160]   in the couple months leading up
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.580]   where I had issues with passing out under the bar.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.320]   So completely losing consciousness.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.480]   And this was on weight less than a thousand pounds even.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   So that was like all this buildup in me going, what if?
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.840]   I think I have this resolved, but what if I get up there
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.720]   and I can't even do a rep?
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.120]   How embarrassing will this be that I've been talking
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.500]   about this and planning for this for so long?
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.840]   But outside of that, I knew I could do it.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.800]   In fact, I wanted to do even more, even up to the second rep.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.420]   Training is about working into a fatigue state.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:57.420]   So you're building an amount of fatigue in your system.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.540]   And then when you let off of it,
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.880]   that's when you get a compensation
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.240]   and that's how you stair-step training.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.160]   This is periodization, but leading into a big event,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.040]   you're accumulating this massive amount of fatigue.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.620]   And so I was performing at a level that I could do it.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.040]   And so I knew I was gonna be able to on meet
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.180]   because then you give yourself that window
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.680]   to be able to recover and super compensate
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.360]   and be able to do a little bit more.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.280]   So that first rep when I did it, strength-wise,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.800]   I went, I could do this for five reps.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.640]   Like it went through my head.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.760]   I'm like, I mean, it was easy and it was fast
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.520]   and it felt amazing.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.360]   And I'm like, I'm gonna crush this.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.880]   And then set rep two, the realization kicked in.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.480]   It's like, oh, this is for reps
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   with a thousand pounds on your back
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.720]   and you're fatiguing just like...
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.840]   And then the third one was every last thing I could muster
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.680]   to just finish.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.440]   I mean, I just barely got it done
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.120]   because the strength is there,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.200]   but that capacity to be able to manage all those resources
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.680]   for that amount of time.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.760]   'Cause it's not just leg strength
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.680]   when we're talking about this stuff.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.680]   - What does it take to go from, I don't know what,
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.080]   from 500 to a thousand?
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.760]   That feels like a journey that's exponential.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.600]   It seems like way harder.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.560]   - It is, it gets exponentially harder.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.400]   It does.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.840]   In the early 2000s, like I said, I started lift in 1988,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.000]   but my first meet in the early 2000s,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   my max deadlift was 523 and my first squat was 550.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.400]   So for reference.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.240]   - That's a heck of a journey.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.920]   - That is a journey.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.200]   - For people that like to lift,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.000]   what should they understand about the difference
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.100]   between doing 500 and a thousand?
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.760]   In terms of the actual lift
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.360]   that you were experiencing that day,
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.400]   in terms of the mechanics,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.000]   in terms of all the things you have to be,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.080]   like the neurological adaptation you mentioned,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.560]   the breathing, the core strength,
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.920]   like techniques, like little tricks, psychological tricks,
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.640]   anything that kind of stands out to you?
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.240]   - The level of intent and the opportunity for error
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.520]   are at a different level.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.200]   So just the minutest changes of position
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.240]   by quarter inch, half inch can be make or break
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.080]   at that level.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.640]   So these things, everything gets amplified.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.000]   So the ability to start with having the pelvis
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.320]   just in the right orientation to the diaphragm
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.600]   before we start initiating what we call
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.880]   the eccentric loading of the abdominal cavity
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.920]   to create this intra-abdominal pressure
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.600]   of working against this outward expansion,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.200]   working against the outer sheath
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.640]   of abdominal thoracolumbar musculature, obliques,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   causing the co-contraction at the pelvic floor,
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.520]   all this stuff and how you cue that,
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.800]   'cause you can't think about all this stuff.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.700]   You need to break it down and distill in practice
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.000]   to like it's one simple cue that we now lock down
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.560]   and control this torso stability,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.920]   because this is what these fundamental movements are about
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.600]   is being able to control our spinal mechanics
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.080]   and then now be able to maintain that
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.280]   while articulating the joints around that
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.700]   through a range of motion,
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.720]   and then using the main power drivers.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.600]   So in this instance, both instances,
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.780]   it's the hip complex to generate that power
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.700]   and transfer it from how we're rooted
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.340]   and connected to the floor through to the distal end,
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.100]   which would be the barbell on the shoulder.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.980]   There's a couple of key concepts.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.820]   So one is that what we just talked through
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.180]   is how to actually maintain that stability.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.740]   So if you have either the diaphragm,
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.220]   so which is connected at the rib cage,
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.420]   so out of alignment in any position,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.040]   it needs to be in alignment with the pelvis.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.360]   So those two in opposition.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.640]   So this is simple engineering here,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.840]   because what we're gonna do is eccentrically load this.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.920]   We're gonna use the diaphragm
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.160]   just like you would in a diaphragm pump,
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.180]   where it's gonna press down on all the tissue in there.
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.880]   So we're not using breath.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.400]   So our breath was actually a lot of times a default pattern
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.240]   when people do that,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.080]   because they'll bring it into their chest
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.800]   and raise their rib cage.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.380]   So what we wanna do is just initiate the diaphragm.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.260]   Air can be used as well over the top at the final
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.720]   to create just a little bit more downward pressure.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.940]   But if we have out of alignment there,
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.760]   we have a pressure leak,
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.880]   where it's gonna be push out the front or the rear
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.980]   if you're either inflection or extension.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.500]   And then that causes this co-contraction
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.580]   and all this pressure of the organs,
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.220]   essentially outward against all those tissue
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.760]   for the co-contraction, as well as surrounding the spine
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.180]   to be able to stabilize that.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.420]   And then it puts all the muscles on both sides of the body
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.180]   in what we call the best length tension relationship.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.060]   So if you think about a curl and we reach our arm out,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.580]   at the extended length, our bicep is not as strong,
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.380]   and then all the way in the curl position,
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.220]   it's not as strong.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.040]   There's somewhere in here that's this control of both.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.140]   And so when you're sitting there arched or bent over,
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.300]   we have muscles that are past either one of those ranges.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.800]   So they've got a lot of tension,
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.040]   which then will create relaxation on the other side.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.900]   So we wanna have, and all of that needs to be working.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.680]   And now the next important thing is the foot.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.800]   So it's actually this connection to the ground
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.360]   and how we're actually using the foot and ankle complex
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.780]   to grab and grip this connection to the ground
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.100]   and elicit an effect.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.520]   And because of this, and then everything between
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.100]   will naturally kind of do what it needs to do.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.620]   So people like to focus on knee position
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.900]   or how far out their hips are, all this other stuff,
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.260]   which is outputs of this.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.540]   So if we control the torso and the knee,
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.300]   the only thing that can happen from that point
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.700]   is for the squat to happen.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.940]   All right.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.660]   So this allows us to use this massive,
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.620]   the hip complex for all the muscles around that
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.880]   that are built to drive through hip extension
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.200]   to complete the squat.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.840]   I did actually miss one thing in there.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.440]   So this torso, people will often miss,
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.600]   the lat is a spinal stabilizer as well.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.680]   So that's key in controlling function at the TL junction,
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.740]   which is just above the lumbar spine.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.280]   So kind of right opposite where your sternum is,
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.880]   and you'll see people kind of roll over sometimes
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.640]   like in an Olympic squat or something like that
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.880]   where they lose position.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.200]   And that's often because they're close grip
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.960]   because you can't engage the lats very well that way.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.460]   And they're pushing up in the bar,
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.220]   but you want to be able to drive
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.940]   and pull the bar to your center.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.580]   And that's going to create and use the lats now to drive
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.820]   and connect the shoulder into this.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.020]   And we're kind of congressing and tightening all this stuff
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.340]   towards that center to create that entire torso stability.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.140]   That's why I was using torso stability,
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.620]   not just core stability in my conversation earlier.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.460]   - Torso stability.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.820]   Okay. So there's all these like modules
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.300]   - Yeah. - of the body
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.380]   then connected to the grounding
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.340]   with like your feet on the ground,
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.440]   everything you're speaking to,
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.440]   how do you work each of those modules?
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.620]   Is this over time you kind of develop the feel
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.000]   that ultimately boils down to this one simple cue
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.060]   that you mentioned,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.180]   or can you like literally study each particular module
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.100]   in yourself and see how it affects the lift?
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.700]   - So the best way, and I'm a big believer,
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.780]   'cause I hate just like people getting out
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.740]   and just doing just movement stuff
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.060]   and not actually adding load,
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.060]   because we only adapt when there's load.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.740]   Maybe we can get some, you know,
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.940]   some proprioception or awareness of position
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.340]   and other stuff doing some corrective patterns
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.420]   and other stuff.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.680]   But this is basic physiology,
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.460]   is that there must be an imposed demand
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.000]   for us to have adaptation.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.560]   And this is mental, this is emotional,
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.460]   this is all these areas,
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.620]   but, and people miss that.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.700]   So I prefer to be able to look at a person,
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.980]   and this is our methodology,
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.200]   and do the assessment in any basic loaded movement.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.340]   So with developing an eye for that,
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.020]   you can actually see and go,
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.320]   okay, we've got a fault pattern right here in the foot,
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.380]   and use a cue or a set of cues,
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.460]   doesn't really matter till we find the one that works
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.780]   and bring that, and now we know.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.180]   We wanna simplify this.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.020]   Stuff I just walked through,
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.060]   that sounds really complicated,
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.540]   and it is if we try to break down and distill it all,
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.660]   but like, let's just find the basic stuff
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.540]   that gets us in the range, start working,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.900]   and then find the next as we add load,
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.140]   and now we find where's our next area
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.380]   that we're starting to fault at,
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.780]   and then go there again next.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.140]   So this is what we do,
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.820]   what we teach in our educational platform.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.940]   So we are the only, I believe,
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.420]   everybody wants to do a lot of these assessments,
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.060]   on a bench, on a table, body,
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.620]   and it's like, no, let's go squat, let's go deadlift.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.060]   If you do strongman and it's a yoke carry, let's yoke carry.
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.620]   'Cause these are basic human fundamentals,
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.080]   it's not power lifting.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.900]   Like this is how we function,
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.380]   this is why we work with 29
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.180]   of the 30 major league baseball teams,
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.820]   and 90% of all professional sports out there,
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.960]   in North America, sorry.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.580]   Although we do some work with Tour de France
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.160]   and other stuff as well.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.220]   And North America, I do mean hockey too.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.660]   (laughing)
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.140]   But these principles, like, you know,
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.100]   if the Dodgers won't bring us in,
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.500]   they're not learning how to power lift.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.940]   You know, we're gonna, obviously,
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.860]   we'll probably be doing,
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.260]   we do a little bit more shoulder focus
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.260]   than hip focus with their athletes, or their coaches.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.940]   We're usually working with the coaches, not the athletes.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.060]   - And so you help them,
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.020]   and then the same thing on yourself,
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.060]   to understand the role
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.380]   that these different muscle groups have
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.180]   on the holistic lift.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.180]   - Yeah, so it's all about getting the joints
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.060]   in the appropriate position,
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.980]   so that we can manage loads,
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.820]   so that we're not putting undue stress on the joint,
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.100]   we're getting the proper link tension,
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.500]   we're getting these basic fundamental things with the body.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.860]   And so the largest global impact that you will have
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.700]   is through spinal mechanics.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.100]   I can't look at a shoulder if I'm not managing this,
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.100]   'cause it's your spine.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.220]   So for those that are just listening,
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.060]   like, I'm arching and then flexing.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.860]   That's gonna affect shoulder extension,
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.060]   flexion, all these sorts of things.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.340]   So it could even affect things down
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.180]   to what's looking at dorsiflexion issues on the foot.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.940]   And then that's why I go to the foot next,
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.820]   because it has the second largest global impact.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.660]   And then from there,
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.260]   now I'm gonna look at the big energy drivers,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.660]   which is the hip complex, shoulder complex.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.340]   And then we can start looking
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.060]   at kind of the peripheral things,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.980]   but usually that's some sort of output of the other,
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.340]   but the knees, the elbows, the things like that.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.180]   So it's all about getting the stack,
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.660]   which affects neurology.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.300]   So let's talk in engineering terms.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.140]   You get in a car, modern car today,
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:35.980]   and a lot of them will have
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.580]   this traction control button in there.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.820]   And there's a big misconception that,
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.100]   you know, I'm out and it's snowy,
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.780]   or here in Austin only rainy,
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.820]   well, it probably doesn't rain much,
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.860]   but you're going around a corner, start slipping.
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.140]   It's like, oh, it's gonna send the powers
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.060]   from the wheels that are slipping
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.580]   to the ones that are gripping,
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.380]   and keep me from crashing and dying a fiery death.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.940]   Well, that's not how it works.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.900]   It's the exact same.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.500]   We've got the tires, which are our foot,
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.300]   you know, the connection to the ground, right?
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.140]   We've got the power driver, which is, you know,
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.820]   the engine, the transmission delivering,
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.500]   you know, the power through it.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.060]   And we've got the stability or suspension.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.340]   And then we have the neurology.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.860]   And what the neurology is doing,
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.500]   it's sensing that we don't have good stability
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.540]   or a loss of connection somewhere.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.780]   And so I need to save you from crashing and hurting yourself.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.980]   And so it goes to the engine and says,
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.860]   let's retard the timing, let's reduce the shift patterns,
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.540]   and we're just reducing the power output.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.060]   And that's straight how the human body works.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.620]   So when I do this stuff, it's actually affecting that.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.740]   I mean, I can take somebody and do some minute changes
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.340]   with the neck position at the thoracic outlet, okay?
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.220]   And immediately see an enhancement in power output.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.060]   And I can measure it.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.380]   We measure this stuff with velocity devices
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.820]   and see like a 10%, boom, jump.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.740]   And so think about that.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.140]   What about all your training through the years
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.460]   where you actually had additional capacity,
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.060]   but you weren't using it
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.740]   because your traction control was on?
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.820]   Now you figure this out stuff,
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.020]   and now you start stacking it,
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.220]   and now you can see so much greater.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.660]   So it's not just injury prevention.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.660]   This is performance and additive performance over time.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.140]   This is huge, and people don't really think about this stuff
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.260]   but we can turn that stuff off,
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.300]   which is actually gonna also, again, make us safer.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.740]   But what we wanna do is the performance tuned race car.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.060]   Do they have a traction control button?
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.460]   No, they got some amazing tires to grip the ground,
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.140]   a performance tuned suspension,
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.820]   and that driver's gonna put what?
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.140]   His foot to the metal.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.740]   He's gonna put it to the floor.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.820]   Okay, that's a performance vehicle.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.220]   That's what we wanna be.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   - I wanna continue on that line,
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.140]   but first I have to ask,
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.260]   how did it feel to accomplish the grand goal?
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.100]   - Oh my God.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.060]   - Okay, when you just stand back,
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.240]   1,000 pounds for reps, what'd it feel like?
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.740]   - Anybody can go watch the video online.
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   - It's well filmed, by the way.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.620]   Got me all excited.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.260]   - Oh, well, the movies.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.580]   So we actually have the final footage of that,
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.300]   the good footage, not posted yet.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.500]   So it's literally just an Instagram video
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.420]   or a phone video right now, the only one online.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.820]   - It's on your YouTube channel, but it's dramatic.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.660]   - Yes, it is.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.260]   It came out just timed to the music perfectly too,
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.300]   which is, I listened to some odd music,
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.500]   which there's some reason behind that.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.340]   But--
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.820]   - I liked it though.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.660]   It was great.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.660]   You're saying there's full length footage?
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.500]   - There's a documentary that's,
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.220]   it's got a little slowed because of COVID
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.380]   'cause it's also a backstory of "The Eagle and the Dragon,"
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.620]   my book, about why I do kind of the things
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.220]   that I've done in my life.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.140]   That's what I'm assuming the director's working on.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.940]   I don't really have the control of the movie, right?
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.620]   (laughing)
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.500]   - But okay, but the video's incredible.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.340]   How did it feel?
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.160]   - How'd it feel?
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.500]   I started crying.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.460]   It was overwhelming to have worked so intensely
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.300]   and so long and hard at something
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.180]   that pushed every ounce of me to the limit.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.500]   And I did it.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.420]   I'm getting a little emotional.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.300]   I did exactly what I said I was gonna fucking do.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.980]   And it was overpowering.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.040]   I mean, I was just crying uncontrollably.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.580]   Just with a mixture of,
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.620]   I don't know what,
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.260]   the mixture of emotions is hard to explain
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.460]   because it was the completion of something.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.960]   It was a new phase of my life.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.140]   - I mean, there's so many things here.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.780]   So one, you set an impossible goal and you accomplished it.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.700]   One.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.540]   Two is on the broader humanity aspect,
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.580]   how many humans in this world accomplish perfection
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.220]   in a particular direction required to do this?
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.260]   So you're basically representing
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.860]   one little glimmer of excellence of the human spirit.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.260]   - There's always more.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.260]   So understand this.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.660]   This is a basic fundamental.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.120]   You can always do better.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.020]   There is no such thing as perfection.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.100]   You could always, there is always more.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.660]   So anytime you reach something,
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.740]   any amazing workout or accomplishment in life,
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.960]   could you have put more into it?
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.800]   Could you?
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.620]   Yes.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.300]   But here's the thing.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.980]   I left on my terms.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.680]   I said, this is it.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.040]   I'm gonna work towards, I've been training for 30 years.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.880]   I'm gonna do this thing that is,
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.040]   like I couldn't even say
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.960]   that I was gonna do it years before.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.340]   I'm gonna do it and then I'm done.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.080]   I didn't leave from an injury.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.120]   I wasn't forced.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.080]   I left on, I did exactly what I said.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.200]   I went to a level that I,
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.280]   I left on my terms.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.920]   And that's unique.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.060]   'Cause that's usually not the case.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.120]   Usually you kind of either taper out or it doesn't matter.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.760]   I'm talking like anything in life in general, right?
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.840]   You taper out, you fail, you hurt, you lose a job.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.860]   Something, you roll into retirement.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.080]   - You accomplished something truly great
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.680]   and you walked away on your own terms.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.080]   Is there a sadness completing something like that?
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.520]   Because it's in one perspective,
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.000]   the greatest thing you'll ever do.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.560]   And like when you accomplish such a great height,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.320]   in some sense you have to face your mortality at that point.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.280]   - So good question,
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.480]   but it is certainly not the greatest thing that I'll ever do.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.840]   The greatest physical strength I'll ever do.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.240]   The greatest, yes.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.640]   But that was an expression of some of my values
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.160]   and the way that I want to live.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.280]   It was a way of expressing it.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.760]   So understanding that is hugely fundamental
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.800]   because we do see so many athletes
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.380]   get to the end of a career
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.840]   and then they fall into a depressive state
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.240]   and struggle with drugs, alcohol, depression, so on,
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.240]   because they lost how they identified themselves
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.200]   and trying to figure out where to turn, what to do,
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.320]   but a big central component of their identity is lost.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   So I knew that this was one way to express that
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.520]   and my grand goals have shifted.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.200]   They're shifted to other outlets
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.760]   that allow me to express that.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.060]   Like my company's Kabuki Strength,
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.000]   I'm going to change the face of fitness
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.080]   as well as all the way through with its integration
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.280]   with clinical medicine and telemedicine.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.160]   And I got another five years
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.680]   before even people see what I'm working on.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.520]   I'm five years in right now
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.200]   'cause I had to invent equipment.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.560]   I have to develop methodologies that we're talking.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.240]   I had to do this stuff that Ground Layer wasn't done
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.440]   to create a cohesive ecosystem of training methodology
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.880]   tied to the tools that we're using,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.360]   to the environment tied to,
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.080]   the clinical practice assessment tied to,
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.320]   the interaction between all those
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.160]   and how that actually needs to be reframed
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.260]   because so much of this is broken, okay?
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.140]   So, but there is sadness.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.400]   I won't deny that.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.080]   And the sadness comes in the singularity
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.880]   of focus that I had at that time,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.920]   the being in the process,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.900]   not necessarily doing, but like,
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.380]   having being in this place that the rest of the world
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.600]   kind of fell away from me in those final phases
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.880]   to have something so intense,
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.360]   to have a team around me so focused on supporting.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.900]   And like, it took me a couple months after that squat,
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.420]   I finally one day I woke up and I was like,
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.580]   oh, welcome back to the world.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.060]   Like I was in such a mental fog.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.960]   Like I was, it took me a while to climb out of that,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.020]   but that space, that level of intensity and drive
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.680]   and living and being in that space,
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.540]   I do miss that, but I also, I can't continue that.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.140]   I couldn't continue, like,
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.500]   there's a point of like, you push it so hard,
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.020]   the level to try to go from there is not acceptable
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.180]   for what you, the impacts that it'll have on your life
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.000]   or how you want to live.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.860]   And it was taking away those final,
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.300]   like I had to do extreme things
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.820]   and live in an extreme way to get there.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.720]   - You're just a genius in this whole space of strength
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.460]   and health and almost like biology
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:45.420]   that the strength feat is just one representation of that.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.380]   But this particular strength feat required
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.160]   that kind of singular focus, which I think,
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.260]   I don't know, there's something beautiful
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.620]   about that singular focus.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.540]   - There is.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.180]   - Often only truly perfected in athletics.
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.940]   I see it with the greatest Olympic athletes as well.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.420]   The kind of singular focus required there is incredible.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.820]   It's somehow some of the most beautiful things
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.060]   that humans can do.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.820]   - And it's not just that thing.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.480]   So that's the thing, it's like, oh, that must be it.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.020]   When we say singularity of focus, it's not like,
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.460]   because it covers a vast array of stuff.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:24.060]   Like I was working with people, you know, all,
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.940]   well, yeah, all around North America.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.340]   I wouldn't say anybody around the globe,
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.660]   but professionals coming in,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.740]   working on different aspects of rehab and recovery.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.900]   And like, I mean, I'm tapping all sorts of stuff
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   in so many platforms from nutrition to drugs,
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:46.020]   to again, like, you know, various Chinese medicine,
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.580]   you know, as far as, you know.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.180]   - But also the humans in your life,
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.740]   just love and positivity and just inspiration,
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.060]   all those kinds of aspects.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.340]   I mean, you probably would have done much more
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.820]   if you went outside North America,
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.340]   talked to some Russians, just between you and I.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.180]   Some Russians.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.020]   - Possibly.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.840]   (laughing)
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.420]   - They give you some, I don't know,
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.620]   there's some incredible strength athletes in Eastern Europe.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.660]   - Absolutely.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.540]   I've got the best one coming in September to get fixed, so.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.060]   - What do you mean by fixed?
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.800]   - So I'm not sure what his particular issues are,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.680]   but he has held the all-time world record repeatedly
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.100]   for a long time, and he hasn't competed for some time,
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.860]   and he just reached out saying he would like to come
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.620]   and have me take a look and see if I can get him fixed
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.100]   because he needs to return.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.240]   - Okay, so it's more injury-centric versus like form
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.780]   and fundamental-centric combination of everything.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.380]   - Everybody always wants to focus on the output.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.260]   How do you give me the fix for that?
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.300]   But it ties right back into all those other things, right?
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.860]   So, but yeah, the Eastern block continued
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.440]   to be a dominant force in regards to athletics
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.980]   and strength athletics, without a doubt.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.120]   Some of my big rivals in my competitive days
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.160]   were, that's who it was.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.440]   - Rivalry brings out the best in us.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.520]   Can you tell me the story of your childhood?
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.740]   - It's definitely outside the scope of the norm,
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.800]   well, today, maybe not 150 or 200 years ago,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   but my parents, highly intelligent people
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.980]   coming out of the Bay Area.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.340]   My mom was going to school to be a chemical engineer.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.000]   She was a top student athlete, graduated out of her school.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.060]   My father was a member of MENSA.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.900]   My stepfather was just a genius,
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.500]   but not able to really function in society.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.340]   But my mom was, she had some demons and some other stuff
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.100]   and just, she just said one day, she's like,
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.740]   "I just don't wanna be part of society."
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.580]   She still isn't.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.700]   Lives out in the desert, but has her minds.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.760]   But she wanted to figure out a way
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.080]   to make a life outside of that.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.480]   And so that's where we ended up,
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.440]   is up in the mountains in Northern California.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.440]   And a lot of that was them trying to get into
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.520]   successfully growing marijuana,
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.840]   which back in that, wasn't legal back then, highly illegal.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.800]   And in fact, those areas were,
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   some of the areas where I lived were quite dangerous.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.720]   So there's a documentary, "Murder Mountain,"
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.200]   that came out recently.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.280]   If you watch that, you'll tie into my book,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.040]   just the understanding of the stuff
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.680]   that I was talking about, dealing with serial killers,
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   human trafficking, police corruption, murderers,
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.440]   like just how real that stuff is
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.800]   if it doesn't capture you from the book, okay?
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.560]   - The book, by the way, is "The Eagle and the Dragon."
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.560]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.920]   (both laughing)
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.760]   Yeah, yeah. - It's a great one.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.760]   - I'm a terrible salesperson, like I told you.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.280]   So. (laughs)
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.100]   - But a good, it's a good title.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.840]   I don't know if you came up with it, but.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.960]   - I did, yeah.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.680]   - So yeah, we'll talk about that anyway.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.080]   - We're living by a stream, off a meadow.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.840]   There's no roads into where you have to hike in.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.560]   And we've got beams lashed into the trees up above us
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.720]   because that's where our bedding is
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.960]   'cause there's rattlesnake dens all around.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.960]   And six years old, I'm being taught how to capture
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.600]   and handle live rattlesnakes
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.480]   because that's what I need to do to be safe.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.040]   And you can imagine, six years old,
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.820]   sitting there with a live rattlesnake in your hand,
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.440]   grabbing it by the side of the head,
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.480]   controlling so it can't bite you.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.160]   And it's just wrapping itself around your arm
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.480]   and you're staring at it.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.560]   It's only intent is, right then, is to kill you.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.720]   Like, that's it, right?
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.440]   You wanna take a bath,
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.020]   it's filling up the jug in the stream
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.920]   and setting it out on the rocks during the sun
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.120]   so you can dump it over your head.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.320]   And not all the living was that way.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.120]   You know, good part was similar to that, tent living,
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.320]   living in a 16-foot trailer with a family of six,
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.640]   which is not much bigger than the space
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.840]   that we're sitting here.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.500]   So, and we're talking hard winters
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.540]   with feet of snow on the ground, nowhere to go.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.560]   I'm living in the back of the pickup truck
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.020]   in just a standard sleeping bag
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.320]   that we get from the Salvation Army,
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.040]   not the Blow Zero.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.120]   So I'm not sleeping well.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.840]   There's living in homes that were maybe condemned.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.200]   There's no doors even on 'em,
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.880]   no electricity or running water,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.360]   or one or the other or both,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.480]   and sometimes a little bit better.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.840]   By the time we got to high school, we had a mobile home.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.200]   So my stepfather had won a disability payment
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.220]   'cause he had a broken arm that whole time
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.240]   from an accident a long time ago
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.440]   and finally got an award
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   and got a down payment on this mobile home
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.200]   that didn't have, again, doors on the inside.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.840]   It did have running water, it did have electricity.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.400]   Didn't have a kitchen.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.720]   You know, the windows would crank closed and open,
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.040]   but they wouldn't close all the way.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.600]   So they'll trim 'em in with plastic
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   to be able to try to protect from the elements.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600]   That was my environment,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.480]   like learning how to forage for mushrooms.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.320]   I mean, there were summers I would send,
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.800]   and my parents would be out.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.100]   They were in the drug trade earlier.
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.200]   We got taken by the police
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   and put into foster care for a while,
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.520]   which ties into some of the stories
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.640]   with human trafficking.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.960]   And honestly, it's in my book,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.740]   but it's really hard for me to talk about that stuff.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.680]   And obviously not all that's in the book.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.960]   But they got us back, moved to Oregon,
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.200]   and they stayed out of the drug trade from that time
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.700]   to ensure that they didn't lose us again.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.740]   But quickly, we kind of fell back into the same thing.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.540]   So at that point, it was learning about geology
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.520]   and starting to do mining
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.600]   and firewood cutting, but mostly the mining
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.440]   'cause Pat's broken arm chainsaw made a little tough.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.160]   - If you remember just the sequence of moments,
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:48.200]   are you haunted by the darker moments of your childhood?
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   Do you remember moments of simple joy and happiness?
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.460]   - Outside of the living around dangerous people
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.080]   and the interactions that came from that,
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.840]   we were a family.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.920]   We were a cohesive unit battling against the world together.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.680]   We spent all our time together, work, play.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.720]   I was there.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.200]   I was helping raise my siblings or I was working with them.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.440]   And it was a constant, like I said,
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.880]   we were very physically active.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.880]   So I had that in my upbringing.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.400]   That plug for my shoe company, Barefoot, B-E-A-R.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.680]   I ran around the wilderness and bare feet all the time.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.000]   But I had a lot of great moments
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.600]   and I'm thankful for a lot of that childhood
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.200]   once we take out the trauma
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.240]   and the other stuff associated with it.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:44.640]   And so the connection that I have with my sisters is huge.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.000]   That goes a bit further 'cause I am kind of like
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.120]   a little bit of a father figure
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.920]   because I was at home raising them.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.120]   And then later I took custody of them
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.240]   while I was going to school
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.920]   because the environment at home deteriorated further.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.520]   Their stepfather, like I said,
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.040]   was he wasn't capable of managing life.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.560]   And my mom had a mental breakdown and took off to Montana
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.440]   and he descended into madness even worse.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.960]   Actually took my 13 year old sister
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.640]   and kicked her out in the middle of winter,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.040]   couple feet of snow on the ground
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.400]   because he thought she stole his favorite cereal bowl type.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:25.040]   So that's when I took in and I was going to college,
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.120]   put myself through college
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.480]   and I started taking custody of my sisters and raising them.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   So anyway, we're still like very, very tight family.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.640]   It took, there was a few years later in life
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.280]   like that the connection with my mother was kind of broken.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.540]   I didn't speak to her for years
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.920]   because of her basically abandoning my sisters
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.880]   and me having to come in,
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   but we've worked through that as best we can.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.200]   - So you anger on your part?
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.160]   - It wasn't, there might've been some anger.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.440]   - Did you always love her?
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.560]   - Yes, and I still do.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.440]   And I'm so, she's taught me basically everything I know
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.120]   about strength and perseverance
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:11.120]   and living life on your terms and being able to create that.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:16.040]   And so much of what I am is from that, right?
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:21.040]   We've all had to learn to be okay with the way she is
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.000]   because she is just blunt,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.880]   but she's the one that figured out
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.880]   that the human trafficking situation
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.140]   and got the DA involved and got all the,
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:40.680]   she's the one that I've learned a lot from her.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.360]   - Did you inherit some of the demons?
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.640]   - Oh, most certainly.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.640]   And it's something I've continued like,
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.720]   and my father's side has been really tough on that
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.680]   because some of it is just based genetic as well.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.960]   So my stepfather made, I think six or seven attempts
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.980]   on his life during his lifetime.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.240]   One of those in front of me,
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.680]   his mother blew her head off with a shotgun.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.780]   Her brother jumped out a window in LA.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.040]   Their father did something similar.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.700]   And I don't know how far back it goes
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.480]   because there is no family except for me and my children.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.640]   - You spoke about going through depression yourself.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.160]   - Yeah.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.360]   - Can you talk about some of the darker moments of that?
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.200]   Have you ever, like many in your family,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.720]   have you ever considered suicide?
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.560]   - Yes, I have.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.460]   Yes, I have.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:39.520]   - You've achieved a lot of exceptional things in your life.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.600]   Can you talk about those early days of depression
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.000]   and how you overcame it?
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.720]   - Yeah, so the things that I did
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.560]   that people give me accolades for
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.420]   are the things that I did selfishly to save myself.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.160]   The things like taking custody of my sisters,
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.160]   being the person that everybody around,
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.120]   the important people relied on,
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.400]   the fact that I had to step to the plate and be present
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.780]   and be that person.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Because if I failed, they failed.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.080]   They would be like the people that I grew up with
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   that are dead or in prison or on drugs.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.000]   And they're either way to one of those, right?
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.320]   That's where everybody ended.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.880]   And I wasn't gonna let that happen.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.500]   - What about saving yourself?
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.680]   - And so that's how, in those early days,
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.520]   that's how I did it.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.720]   Not saying it's the best approach,
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.100]   but it was survivor mentality.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.920]   It was, I can't selfishly do that
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.040]   because I have them to take care of.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.480]   Right?
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.400]   And then that continued where I would keep putting myself
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.000]   in these leadership roles or other things.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.400]   And there's always being this person
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.320]   that was at the center, at the hub
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.800]   that forced me to be there.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.000]   And so it's only in the more recent,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.960]   last decade or so that I have had to really learn
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.880]   how to come and start confronting some of those demons.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.060]   And you think, man, why is the guy so successful?
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.280]   Like, I mean, and we haven't talked about
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.260]   all the stuff that I've done,
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.580]   but like I've seen a lot of success
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.580]   in both business leadership, athletics, academics,
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:34.140]   entrepreneurship, all these sorts of things, right?
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.900]   But if it wasn't for having kids
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.660]   and the same being in the position, I wouldn't be here.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.320]   And that's just, that's the reality of it.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   And I'm learning to come and manage those as best I can,
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.940]   learning to meditate into those things
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.800]   and really feel what the driver is
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.340]   so I can get to those root understanding
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.200]   and having some guidance doing so.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.240]   Like if you've got mental health issues,
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.820]   this isn't something that you need to tackle on your own.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.040]   Like having a professional that can help guide you
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.060]   on that introspective journey is something like,
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.920]   it's not like, hey, I'm big tough guy,
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.120]   I can handle everything.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   - That's fascinating that you saved yourself.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:26.440]   That's quite powerful to save yourself
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.440]   by having others depend on you.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.160]   And so you can't fail, you can't fuck it up.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.680]   And that's a reason to keep moving forward.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.320]   But on the flip side, that's not addressing the darkness.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.380]   - It's not.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:45.400]   And it probably not a sustainable strategy either, right?
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.400]   So I recognize these things.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.240]   - I don't know.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.260]   Perhaps it is sustainable.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.320]   Perhaps, I mean, there's something beautiful
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.320]   about giving yourself basically in service of others
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.720]   and thereby creating purpose.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.200]   And then like, it's almost like fake it till you make it.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.960]   And then you make it eventually.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.120]   - That is purpose though.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.000]   - That is purpose.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.840]   - That is purpose.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.640]   I mean, you have to, to me,
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.040]   life is about taking your cup
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.600]   and how you choose to pour it out,
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.720]   how you choose to give, what is your purpose?
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.880]   What is that connection with everybody around you?
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.800]   This is, that's the intent, that's the life.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.600]   That's what life is about.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.960]   How are you going to help those around you?
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.420]   How are you gonna help the world?
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.420]   Your purpose is right here, figuring out what this is
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.580]   and then how to do that.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.380]   But at the same time, you can't let that run dry.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.100]   So you have to make sure that you're filling that up.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.380]   That's the other side, right?
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.180]   That's the other side.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.000]   - We'll return to your engineering degree,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.100]   which you're obviously scientifically engineering minded,
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.140]   which is fascinating.
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.740]   Your book is titled "The Eagle and the Dragon."
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.180]   What do the eagle and the dragon symbolize?
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.780]   - They're pretty big symbols for me.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.420]   In fact, that covers my entire body as a tattoo.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:11.100]   So the first one I had done at around 19 years old.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.280]   And so this is, or started at 19.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.300]   It's an eagle that covers my entire front,
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.060]   you know, my stomach, rib cage,
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.780]   and one that was on my back that covered most of my back.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:27.780]   And there's chained at the, well, at the claw, I guess.
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:32.140]   And the chain wraps down around and attaches to my ankle.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.340]   And there's a shackle there.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.380]   And so this was something that I had done at that age
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.860]   because it was, to me, it was a representation
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:44.340]   of your potential, your strengths, your abilities,
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.520]   that you can fly to whatever height
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.620]   that you want in this world.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.120]   The only thing holding you back
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.980]   at the end of the day is yourself.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.420]   And this was, I hadn't necessarily accomplished
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.420]   a whole lot at that time.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.780]   I mean, I was valedictorian for high school,
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.920]   small high school, does that even count?
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.580]   Yeah, I was a state level wrestler.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.100]   This was my belief.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.100]   And--
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.220]   - You sensed that there was a potential in you.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.340]   And the only thing that could stop you
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.500]   from realizing that potential was yourself.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.900]   - That's right.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:20.180]   - That's a heck of a tattoo to get, by the way, at 19, but.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.260]   About 40 hours went into that thing.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.260]   - It shows you got some guts.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.060]   - And then the next tattoo,
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.980]   so I only have two.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:36.940]   I had done in 2015, 2016,
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.200]   when I, so at this point in my life.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.140]   So I had done that.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.580]   I had flown to whatever heights, right?
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:45.540]   So I had proven to myself
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:49.860]   and maybe done what I thought I needed to do
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:53.820]   to show the world that this poor kid from the sticks,
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.260]   this kid growing up in the mountains with nothing
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.300]   could achieve the American dream.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.300]   I was a corporate executive sought after
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.300]   that I'd come in, I'd fix companies,
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.260]   I'd turn around and prep them for sale.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.880]   I'd take a company and grow it from a regional
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.540]   to a national, to a global presence.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.300]   I did this in the automotive manufacturing,
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.060]   aerospace manufacturing, high-tech, heavy industry.
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.500]   And I had a house with a white picket fence.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.220]   I was a successful athlete with all time world records.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.060]   I owned a gym on the side where I coached people
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.620]   and I had a comfortable marriage
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.920]   that everything was hunky-dory with no arguments at home.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.600]   And I walked away from all of it.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.760]   I left everything behind except for my kids.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:50.200]   I wanted to chase what I was meant to do
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.440]   and chase what I was capable of doing.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.780]   I wanted to become a better version of myself,
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.580]   but very intentfully.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:06.660]   And that's what I did.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.060]   I sold, I had multiple homes, sold my homes.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:14.620]   I cashed in all my retirement that I'd earned
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.400]   for 20, nearly 20 years.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.540]   And I lost all that.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.800]   I leveraged myself millions of dollars of personal debt
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.940]   so that if I failed, there was no way out.
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.880]   Even going back to that old career that I did well,
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.260]   I'd be living in an apartment the rest of my life
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.300]   paying it off.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.320]   People questioned, people questioned me at the time
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.460]   because I had a comfortable, easy marriage.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.520]   And I chose to ask for a divorce.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.020]   And I ended up living in an apartment for a couple years
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.280]   with no income, selling off every last thing that I had
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.720]   except for my two vehicles that I built.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.680]   And with my kids.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:00.540]   And I started my businesses to help people
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:03.940]   live a better quality of life, to get them out of pain,
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.800]   to help them live better through strength,
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.500]   to realize that stress, demand, those things,
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.940]   they don't have to be the thing that, if you look back,
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.180]   made you had the bad back, made you have the bad Ds,
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.220]   but they do the opposite.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.180]   They get you out of pain.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.700]   And then I started working on my book
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.680]   to hit on those other things, the mental, the emotional,
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.440]   maybe even spiritual.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.080]   I don't touch on that one too much in there,
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.420]   but it's all the same.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:34.600]   That things that happen around you to you,
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.720]   like maybe they're bad, I can't take away that,
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.220]   but why can't you use what you have of it
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.400]   to become a stronger and better person,
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.440]   to become more resilient, to be able to take the things
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.700]   that you don't know that are coming in the future.
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.320]   And so this is very intentful.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.280]   And that's what the second,
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.920]   long-winded answer in your question here.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.440]   - The dragon. - The dragon.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.120]   The dragon is an Ouroboros.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:59.680]   And so it circles my entire upper body,
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.720]   my shoulders, my back, my chest, everything.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.360]   It's right here, there's this big dragon head,
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.200]   and its tail is right there in its mouth.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.040]   It's eating itself.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.000]   It may sound a bit graphic or whatever,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.860]   but it's the eating of the old becoming the new.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:18.140]   It is the purposeful reinvention of oneself.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:22.180]   It is the deciding, not realizing just your potential,
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.960]   but deciding specifically who you want to be
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:28.140]   in this fucking world and becoming that person.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:32.440]   - Can you comment on the value and the power
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.440]   of putting a flame to your old life, your old self,
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:44.920]   just destroying all of it as you walk into the new life?
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.840]   Did you have to do that?
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.080]   - I don't recommend this, by the way,
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.920]   because when you put yourself in no way out,
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.680]   there is no way out, okay?
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.720]   Like, you gotta really...
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.840]   But I can be an overconfident individual at times,
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.740]   and I live through extremes.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:11.000]   I think it's a great way of actually finding
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.460]   your real values and how you want to live, honestly,
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.820]   to chase having absolutely perfect squat technique,
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.420]   but chase putting every freaking thing that you got in it,
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.020]   which most people would say, those are opposite.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.620]   Those are diametrically opposed.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:30.580]   I wanted a better home life.
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.020]   I wanted to do more in the world through my work.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.640]   And the burning the bridges mentality
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.580]   is not necessarily the best.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.580]   There was some temperament in that, though,
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:47.920]   because I was slow to make the shift for a long time
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.220]   because I'd been thinking about doing it,
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.420]   but I was thinking about doing it
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:52.540]   in a healthcare perspective.
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.140]   I'm gonna go back to school to be a surgeon
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.660]   or a physical therapist or a chiro,
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:57.920]   because that's where all my research and stuff
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.020]   was in this human movement and rehab and recovery.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.460]   This is the mentors that I'd been developing
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.680]   were the best in the world in these things,
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.660]   in these disciplines.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.020]   Those were my friends.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:15.100]   But I wasn't able to compromise my family's
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:15.980]   certain quality of life.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:16.980]   I wanted to keep that.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.500]   So it was slow and hard for me to make that transition,
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.760]   but I didn't do it until I had a platform built enough
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.540]   that those first few years, I did have an income.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.060]   I was able to make enough from the business
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.740]   until it grew so fast that I needed,
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.180]   so much more needed to come in.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.980]   The living in the apartment piece and doing all that,
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:35.220]   that was actually a couple of years
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:38.940]   into that process, maybe like two years.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.100]   - Well, I'm with you on that.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:44.260]   So I'm actually going through that very process now.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.920]   I put everything, I quit everything,
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.100]   gave away everything and starting anew.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.020]   And unfortunately or fortunately,
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:56.940]   this podcast somehow became quite popular.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.380]   So it's getting in the way of my burning everything
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.220]   to the ground.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.260]   (laughing)
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.800]   But in that, it's a source of joy.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.220]   But the main thing I'm after is the similar project
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.740]   as you is building a business.
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.820]   Sense of joy.
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.380]   So this is the point I want to drive home right now.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.700]   Right now.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:16.680]   Because when I say burn,
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.300]   I learned the burning the bridges works
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:23.300]   because that's how I had to succeed when I was earlier.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.100]   The bridges weren't burnt, they didn't exist.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.700]   There was no couch to go home to.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.980]   There was no fallback plan.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.100]   And it forced me and gave me the confidence
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.620]   to know that I can pull it off.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:37.180]   But I don't encourage people
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.660]   because there's so much out there of this hustle porn
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.180]   and other stuff going, just grind, just go after it,
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:45.300]   get in and start your, you'll get there.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.540]   And it's all about the output, to make money,
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.980]   to be somebody, to do this.
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.560]   And I'll tell you what,
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.900]   that is some short-term motivation right there.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.100]   I feel like dropping a few swear words, but.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.660]   (laughing)
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:57.700]   You're always welcome.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.060]   We've already done a few, so we'll.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.660]   All right, we'll bounce it out.
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.780]   That is short-term.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.660]   That is not going to keep you going.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.860]   This needs, if you're going to go that approach,
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:12.540]   it needs to be because this is your North Star.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.400]   There's going to be so much hard work.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.340]   There's going to be years of just pushing through
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.940]   where your quest, not only is everybody around you
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.860]   questioning you and your family's questioning you,
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:23.420]   you're questioning yourself going,
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.620]   man, I don't know if I can pull this off.
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.620]   You're going to be stressed.
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:28.160]   You're going to be pulled to the max.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.740]   If somebody comes up to me and says,
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:30.900]   should I start a business?
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.000]   I'm going to say no.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.120]   And they'll be like, oh, you're supposed to motivate me.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.620]   If you need me to motivate you,
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.500]   this is the wrong damn approach for you.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.380]   This is going to be hard.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.860]   This is going to be harder than you expect,
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.220]   even with me telling you this.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:49.800]   And so it better damn well be worth it.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.980]   This better be your North fucking star.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:55.460]   This better live and be a way for you
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:58.800]   to be able to articulate or realize
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.900]   those values that you want to live.
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.260]   This isn't something to make money.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.940]   This is a way for you to live the life
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.820]   and be able to share the values
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.520]   that you have with the world.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.440]   And that's what it is.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.660]   And if you don't have that, which is going to give you joy,
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:19.300]   then freaking walk away.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.420]   - Yeah.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:23.620]   - This is not some way to make some money and be known.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.940]   - I mean, this includes both like simple day-to-day joy
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:28.380]   and also deep meaning.
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.380]   The whole thing.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:31.980]   And then that allows you to overcome
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.260]   all the pain along the way.
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.180]   But I got to say, I mean, it's a difficult thing
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.480]   'cause you run a business.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:43.460]   This podcast and a lot of things I do research-wise
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.360]   is full of joy, but it's simple.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.220]   Running a business is hard.
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:55.620]   So it's something that I'm very hesitant about
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:58.620]   in that to almost push back a little bit,
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:03.620]   I think if I do get the guts to start the business,
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:08.220]   it will not be because I'm not choosing a more joyful life
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.360]   'cause I'm already truly happy.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:14.420]   The reason I'll choose is because I just can't help it.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.420]   There's this, I've always had this dream
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.780]   and I know it's gonna lead to suffering
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.820]   and I know it's gonna be a life
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:24.420]   that has less happiness in it.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.780]   As sad as this to say.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.460]   - But it won't be.
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.120]   It won't be less happiness.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.820]   Because we talk about this cup
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.700]   and where you choose to pour it
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.220]   and what you choose to do with it.
[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.020]   And when you look back on things,
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.620]   the things that are gonna give you the most joy,
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:43.180]   the most proud, the things that are gonna stand out
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:45.380]   in your life that you really remember
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.900]   are gonna be those days.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.460]   And those years you struggle,
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.060]   you're gonna look back on 10 years later and go,
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.220]   fuck, those were the glory days.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.780]   Those were the glory days.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.640]   And it won't feel like it at the time.
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:03.420]   - That's so weird.
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.580]   - That's what life's made of.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.940]   And so this is your opportunity, you feel that.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.340]   So right now you got this, when you think about it,
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.900]   you got this little thing twisting up in your gut.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:16.260]   It's like it's a mixture of anxiety and fear
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.300]   as well as excitement.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.340]   And that is, that's your signal
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.020]   that this is your opportunity for that personal growth,
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.060]   to challenge yourself.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.980]   This is your going for a run or working out in the heat.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.080]   It's those things.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.900]   It is your opportunity to go,
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.580]   heck, maybe it even fails.
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.500]   Maybe it even fails.
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:39.300]   But by turning into that, you're gonna learn so much
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.700]   and it's gonna make you so much better.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.060]   And it's the path that you should take
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.100]   when you have this stuff rolling around in there.
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:50.780]   And I don't, it could just be a hard conversation
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.980]   with your partner or your boss.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.820]   It could be taking on a project that,
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:00.740]   your boss has thrown out to the team and you're like,
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.220]   oh, I'm gonna hide in the back, I don't want that one.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.660]   And it's like, maybe, maybe you do.
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.260]   Maybe it's going back to school.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.620]   Maybe it's making that career move that you always wanted,
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.840]   but you're just afraid of.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:19.060]   All these things are your opportunity
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.360]   for you to turn into that.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.380]   It is your workout.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.140]   It is your practice.
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:26.820]   Because if you don't, you'll get soft.
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:27.980]   And who knows what's coming
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:30.020]   and you're not gonna be ready for it.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.300]   And it's gonna run right over the top of you
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.980]   because you're gonna be weak.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.980]   You're gonna be soft.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.460]   - There's some aspect in which choosing that hard path
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.540]   is actually the way to arrive
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.420]   at the richest kind of happiness.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.820]   The greatest fulfillment.
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.900]   That's the funny thing about just the human--
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.140]   - Just make sure you're filling the cup
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.020]   as you're going through it, not pouring it all out.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.540]   So that's the part to figure out, right?
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:56.380]   - Sure.
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:58.440]   Well, life is short anyway.
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:01.800]   Eventually the cup will be empty.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.780]   So maybe time the refilling of the cup correctly
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:10.460]   so you maximize the little time you got.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:13.100]   Let me talk to you about strength a little bit.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.820]   First, high level.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.860]   What are the differences
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.260]   in the different disciplines of strength?
[00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.700]   So powerlifting we talked about.
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.300]   Maybe just to clarify for people,
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.580]   powerlifting, Olympic lifting,
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:28.300]   just regular gym fitness, bodybuilding,
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:31.060]   doing curls in front of the mirror for hours like I do.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:32.820]   What's the difference between all of these?
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:34.820]   Oh, and also strongman.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:39.500]   - Every one of those as far as the athletic disciplines
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.940]   are different qualities.
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.860]   So we wanna think about things as terms of quality.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:49.860]   So there's strength, there's power, there's endurance,
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:54.780]   there's the ability to be coordinated and athletic.
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:58.020]   There's all these things and they're different qualities.
[00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.300]   So your training as it relates to that
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:05.300]   is how you cycle in the development of those qualities.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.700]   What we wanna think about is,
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.660]   there's a lot of different frames of thought.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:13.100]   Some very classical, maybe not classical Russian approach
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.140]   'cause there's a lot of different approach
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.260]   from the Eastern block.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.740]   But one of the ones is developing all the qualities at once,
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.980]   focusing on building those.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.580]   More of a periodization effect
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:27.180]   would be focusing on one quality at a time
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.860]   or one quality while maintaining other qualities
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.180]   and then shifting that around.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.060]   So it's just gonna be a little different
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.020]   based on what the output is and what the desired.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.580]   So like powerlifting is actually, power is the wrong word.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.900]   There's actually no power in it.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.340]   It's just brute, it's strength.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.700]   Application of force.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.260]   So Olympic lifting would actually be a better name
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:54.700]   for powerlifting because that is more explosive development.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.100]   There's strongman is again,
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.860]   now we're getting a little bit more athletic.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:02.220]   It's equipment based on the implements
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.500]   and stuff that are used,
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.980]   how fast you can move your feet and run
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:09.860]   mixed with more endurance, but still very strength focused.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.540]   And there's some things with strongman that is straight.
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.340]   Like each one of these is very also focused
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.980]   on different genetic dispositions.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.260]   So actually if you look at the history of sports,
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.160]   you'll find that they're a lot of times
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.460]   based on different populations.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:28.300]   It sounds like it's very un-PC, but like Highland Games,
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.140]   they've got deeper hip sockets that are shallow.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.340]   So you're gonna see a lot of short hip hinge movements
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.180]   like the caber toss and things like that.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.620]   Muay Thai wrestling,
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.140]   they've got a completely different hip joint.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.040]   And so strongman itself is gonna be
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.740]   for very large frame individuals.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.360]   If you're not well over six foot and a large person,
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.860]   you're probably not going to perform well.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.540]   Very few people at sub six foot
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.960]   have ever done well at strongman
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.340]   just because it's leverage based.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:59.180]   Olympic lifting, we see consistently in Europe,
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:04.460]   the history tells us a high level of hip and back issues
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:09.500]   because of the depth that that hip socket has to go in
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.620]   to be able to complete that lift.
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:14.000]   And so you're gonna see issues with populations
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.820]   that don't have the ability to do that.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.820]   So we've talked a little bit about training
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.660]   as well as disposition.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.060]   - Yeah, and also cross-fit isn't to that.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.300]   That's more like strongman,
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.420]   but for a wider variety of bodies, I suppose.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.060]   - Yep, and definitely more metabolic conditioning focused
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.380]   than the strength aspect of it.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:36.460]   And conditioning is an interesting thing too.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.740]   So that quality, in my opinion,
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.240]   can be developed a lot faster,
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.580]   but kind of peaks much faster as well.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.580]   So where strength, we can continue to add and add
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.220]   and add over time.
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:53.700]   So it's, for me, for conditioning with any strength athlete,
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.020]   I don't like to spend as much time on that.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.740]   So I'll cycle the conditioning work
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.380]   for our strength athletes
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.820]   and then taper that off leading into meet.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.780]   So the more metabolic work,
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.100]   that means the more capacity in strength training
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.540]   that you can accomplish, which is the goal,
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.240]   and recover from.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.180]   But then as we lead to a competition,
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.780]   we want to spend more time on recovering from that.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:18.720]   So we have to pull things out, so we'd pull out less.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.220]   So a typical approach would be taking a six week cycle
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.320]   for conditioning and ramping up
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.580]   over three weeks periods time,
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.500]   then dropping back down again,
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.660]   and ramping up and being slightly offset
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.300]   by a week or two from your strength peaks,
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.140]   so that you've actually tapered the week prior
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.700]   in your conditioning work to your strength work.
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.700]   And but that way we're not hitting conditioning hard
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.580]   all the time, which is a common misstep that people make,
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.000]   is going, well, I need conditioning.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.340]   So they just hammer that at a base level over the top
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.880]   instead of cycling that.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.880]   - If we talk about power lifting,
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.840]   in terms of regimen,
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:02.180]   in terms of exercise, in terms of the process,
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.480]   the wood consistent with what,
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.140]   is there something to be said about general qualities
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.260]   of the consistency of the regimen required to get strong?
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.160]   - Yes.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.160]   So let's talk about some training principles as a whole.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.640]   And this will, I think this will break down
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.220]   what you're wanting.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.140]   The more work that we can fit into a given time,
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.940]   the more progress we're going to make.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:32.120]   But that doesn't mean doing the max amount of work possible
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.600]   at any given time.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.300]   So we know that we're always, to accomplish more,
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.660]   we're always gonna have more.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.820]   And there's a certain ceiling
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:41.660]   that you're gonna hit
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.060]   that you're not gonna be able to add more.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:46.080]   So you wanna start and get the most amount of results
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.880]   that you can with the least amount of work,
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.300]   because you're gonna have to do it again,
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:56.500]   like this stair step over and over, year, decade, so on.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.700]   So when people, this is a big miss people got,
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:02.180]   they look at a Chico program from Russia or so on,
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.060]   and they go, I'm gonna follow this.
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.740]   And it's like, that was specifically written
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.640]   for somebody with 20 years of experience,
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.260]   that's already built the capacities to be at that level.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.220]   So it's all about building that work capacity.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.820]   So how much work can you give in a given time?
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.360]   So now we wanna look at some research
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.660]   as it relates to injuries,
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:23.780]   because injuries are gonna be a big driver over time
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.900]   of what holds you back.
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.960]   So when we talk consistency,
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:32.620]   training hard for three years, five years,
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.500]   it's gonna be really good.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.620]   But what we find is a lot of people train really hard
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.660]   for nine months, have to slow back for a month,
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.040]   get back into it and miss another week because,
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.840]   and so on, they're always like this little nagging,
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.360]   that little nagging.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.680]   And so it's pretty clear in the research,
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.340]   we're looking at when we're stair stepping this stuff,
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.980]   we're looking at acute and chronic loading.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:56.920]   So some fancy words for average
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.180]   and like what's happening right now.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.800]   So this given week would be our acute,
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.920]   chronic would be what is our average loading,
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.000]   let's say over the last six months.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.300]   Okay, so the more that we can move the chronic loading up,
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.200]   the more work we're getting done on as a whole over time,
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.560]   we're gonna get stronger.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.040]   The way that we build the capacity to do that
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.560]   is having spikes in acute loading.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:23.520]   Okay, now, as we do this,
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.500]   the acute loading, if it spikes more than 10,
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:33.040]   maybe 15% from what the chronic loading has been,
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.940]   that accounts for 80% of injuries out there.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.840]   So it's not actually the movement quality
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.120]   or this misstep or the other.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.040]   It usually happens about four, five, six weeks later.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.840]   It's like, oh, this nagging, and then it gets worse.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.880]   And then now you gotta do some rehab,
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.360]   your training sessions aren't as good and so on.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.640]   So now we're starting to look at this.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.600]   Okay, it's like, I wanna do the least amount of work
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.820]   where I can still progress.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.560]   I want to be able to have spikes in my weekly demand
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:09.080]   that don't go above 10 to 15%
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.280]   of what I've been averaging for the last month.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.280]   But every time I do a spike, my average goes up, right?
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.340]   Boom, boom, boom.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.200]   And then that becomes very particular
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.560]   also when you do take planned time off.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.400]   So a lot of people, training session,
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.760]   maybe they're doing a five-week block with a deload week,
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.640]   or you go on vacation for a week,
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.440]   or any of those things that were a downward.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.280]   What does that do to your average and chronic loading?
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.200]   It brings it down.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.520]   And then what does the person wanna do when they come back?
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.040]   Make up for it.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.840]   Now they have a huge spike above, five weeks later,
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.120]   we're dealing with, oh, this elbow, this wrist,
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.240]   whatever's kind of bothering me,
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.640]   and now you're not performing as much.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.080]   So these are some really fundamental pieces of training.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.740]   And then now we can start overlaying the qualities
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:56.040]   that we're trying to develop
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.240]   that we were talking about earlier.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.640]   So now it's, let's talk about my deadlift,
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.840]   my thousand pound deadlift.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.280]   We'll talk about the training cycles for both,
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.000]   the thousand deadlift and squat.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.160]   So backing up a year out from the deadlift,
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.200]   knowing I was training at the time,
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.720]   heavy deadlifts once a week.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.080]   And usually it was two of those sessions a month
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.680]   were really heavy and the others weren't.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.880]   And it's like, okay, how can we get this up
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.840]   to where I'm deadlifting twice a week?
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.860]   Because that's where I wanna be,
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.920]   to be able to accomplish this.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.840]   I need to be loading about that much with frequency
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.980]   with a certain volume to be able to accomplish this goal.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.800]   We're not gonna go through all the math and stuff like that
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.120]   and how that's arrived, but there is math behind this.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.080]   And so instead of just like,
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.980]   oh, well, let's start deadlifting twice a week.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:41.940]   No.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:46.240]   So we start and we take the one session that we've got
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.360]   and we split it, part of it,
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.640]   take part of it away and put it
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.800]   in the second half of the week.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.220]   So the total volume is still the same.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:56.900]   And then we start adding some volume,
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.960]   but I'm doing it at a off a block
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.000]   so that the actual load is,
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.160]   accumulative load is less
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.400]   'cause I have less range of motion.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.700]   And then we start building that closer to the ground,
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.340]   closer to the ground and so on.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.400]   And now we start getting to where I'm almost doing
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.680]   two sessions, full sessions a week.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.280]   And then we start adding a little bit of load.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.400]   And so at my level,
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.200]   this isn't talking about adding another set
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.120]   or another day a week.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.560]   We're talking like in my squat, it might be one rep.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.500]   Instead of doing three sets of three,
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.680]   at one week I do two doubles or two triples,
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.800]   then two doubles to give me one more rep.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.640]   That's it.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.520]   And so we're doing that from one week to the next.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.800]   And that's a cycle, training cycle.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.320]   It might be five, six weeks and then so on.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.280]   And then next one and slowly bringing that average load up.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.940]   So the last phases of the squat, for example,
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.740]   we took the average loading every week.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.200]   So my, of my heavy sets.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   So once we developed all this stuff over the last year
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.200]   to get to this point, now it is taking and going,
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:07.340]   okay, my average load this week is eight reps at 955 pounds.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.340]   And then the next week, let's get it to 957, 963.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:14.800]   And this was pretty aggressive,
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.200]   working up to where my average loading, the final,
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.120]   that at the final was 985 pounds,
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.080]   average load for eight to nine reps.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.600]   And that's what I said, this is the intense part.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.800]   That was why it was the day of was much easier.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.900]   That week over week is pretty brutal.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:32.200]   May not sound well, you're just squatting.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.040]   And now let's back it up.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.720]   Let's look at the quality development.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.520]   So a year out from the squat,
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.080]   obviously I've been working on developing
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.200]   axial load capacity,
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.040]   my capacity to withstand load from top to bottom.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.580]   So I like thinking about things in movement vectors.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.000]   So this vector is an axial loaded vector,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.280]   is the hardest to recover from.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280]   - So what's axial?
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.600]   So like is deadlift, are they both?
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.000]   - They're both, yep.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.880]   So a horizontal, a front to back
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.040]   would be like a row or a press.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.960]   - Why is the axial hardest to recover from?
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.440]   'Cause it's the entire body, the entire torso?
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.440]   - Entire body, just anything that is,
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.040]   that taxes the spinal mechanics.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.060]   I don't, I could tell you my beliefs.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:16.320]   It's studied, it is, okay?
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.880]   We can just keep the discussion on that short like that.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.040]   So we start looking at those different vectors
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:24.920]   that we're training in.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.600]   So this is why, this is important to understand.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.380]   So I'm not just getting into nuance here.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:33.200]   So, hey, squatting is gonna make me jump further
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.640]   'cause it's legs.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.360]   Well, squatting is an axial load vector
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.440]   and jumping is a vector this way.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.400]   So actually hip thrust would help with your,
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.920]   and this is proven in science,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:48.360]   with your forward jumping ability.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.280]   They're both working similar muscles, the glute extension,
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:54.160]   but they're working it in those different platforms.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.680]   So it's really important to understand
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.220]   because people don't understand.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.500]   I'm building my work capacity by doing sled pushes.
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:04.180]   You're not developing your work capacity for squatting.
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:09.180]   - Most movements, even ones as holistic as a squat,
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.080]   require specialization.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:12.900]   - Yeah.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.000]   - You can't get strong at the squat by doing--
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.560]   - You're gonna have some carry over, right, obviously.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.160]   But because taking an untrained person that hasn't done it
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.400]   is still not gonna do as good as somebody
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.280]   that's done nonspecific work but done work.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.080]   So, but yes, for the most part.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.560]   - To get truly strong, you need to specialize.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.920]   - So, but not all the time.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.360]   So now we talk about quality.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:37.280]   So, and if we specialize in the same thing too long,
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.160]   we stagnate because the body adapts to a certain point
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.800]   and just can't make progress.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.560]   So we wanted to save the actual squatting
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.760]   in the pattern with the bar that I was doing
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.600]   for the very end.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.880]   So starting a year out,
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.760]   I started doing work front squatting.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.680]   Like a squat, axial loaded pattern,
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.040]   and worked on maximizing that up.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:03.000]   Then I started shifting to doing transformer bar squat.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.040]   It's this bar I developed that actually changed,
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.520]   manipulates spinal mechanics.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.600]   So I started loading in these more forward positions
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.980]   and being able, again, so now I'm getting closer
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:13.920]   than a front squat but not quite squatting.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.360]   And then I would start adjusting that bar
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.480]   every training cycle to closer to a squat,
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.960]   toaster to a squat till it finally was, right?
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.520]   - What's the difference between a front squat
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.960]   and a regular, like a back squat?
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.520]   Like in terms of the stress on the body, the mechanics,
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.760]   was there something interesting to be said about,
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.100]   like how fundamentally different are they?
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.320]   - So it's interesting, people think about the weight
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.920]   in position to them, like, oh, the bar's in front of me,
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.460]   the bar's behind me, which is not the case.
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:45.120]   The bar is above your midfoot.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.900]   The load is above your midfoot.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:52.280]   So we're actually manipulating the spine behind the bar.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.920]   So we're causing spinal uprighting behind the bar,
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.400]   getting in a more erect position,
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.600]   which is gonna change the relationship of the hip angle,
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.280]   it's gonna change our ability to maintain the spine,
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.360]   it's going to change how much the core comes in,
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.960]   how hard it is to maintain that sternum
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.240]   to diaphragm relationship that we talked about.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.960]   All this stuff starts changing.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.640]   - So the bar stays in the same place.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.880]   The bar's still behind you, but the load moves around.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.000]   But we're actually manipulating the spine around the load.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.080]   - It's incredible.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.720]   - We can tailor it to an athlete,
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.880]   which is great when you got a seven foot plus tall
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.760]   baseball player or a basketball player.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.120]   That's why we work with all these teams.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.960]   Anyway, so it's like you're taking something
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.500]   and getting closer and closer to it.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.320]   At the same time, we're looking at the qualities.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.960]   So like, I needed to be able to really hold
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.000]   this torso position with the weight moving up here.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.960]   Now, unlike the deadlift, the ability to manage
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.160]   this TL position becomes much more challenging.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.360]   So that was also why I was choosing the transformer bar,
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.160]   because it actually challenges that more
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.800]   in those big forward positions.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.840]   I was also working on my back strength tremendously
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   to be able to hold and maintain position.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.480]   So there was a lot of like, I chose a bent over rows.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.340]   So bent over row is a mixed vector.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.640]   So it's a forward to back.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.920]   So it wouldn't have as much carrier,
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:09.120]   but it's also got some axial loading component
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.600]   in it as well.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.200]   So we're working on that.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.960]   And then as we get closer and closer to competition,
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.900]   I'm developing those strengths,
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.120]   but now I need to start tapering those out.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.600]   So all of my recovery needs can now go into
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.080]   the more specific that I'm actually ramping the load up.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.080]   So as I'm ramping the load on the weight,
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.040]   I'm able to ramp it a lot faster
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.760]   because I'm tapering out the other stuff.
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.080]   So I can still keep my total load high,
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.060]   but now get it very, very specific.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.120]   - Wow.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:38.960]   - So everything that I've done has always been
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.800]   kind of an annual training cycle.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.400]   And then again, this was like a,
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.760]   this was a five-year training cycle,
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.980]   but we just kind of walked through the last year of each
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:49.880]   and you can see how these concepts play out in reality.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.160]   - So in the cycling, so this is both for you,
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:58.160]   but also for more recreational strength athletes,
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.440]   let's say there's variety injected into the system.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.520]   - You need variety.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.720]   Because you will basically stagnate at some level, right?
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.540]   So you should always be kind of shifting a little bit.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:14.640]   So three to four month blocks in general for an average,
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.920]   you know, just a gen pop fitness is pretty good.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.640]   Where you're going to spend more time,
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.620]   maybe in a higher rep range or lower rep range,
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:26.080]   a little bit more work on endurance capacity,
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:26.920]   or maybe some more time,
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.360]   hey, I'm playing around with boxing or jujitsu
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.200]   or something like that.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.560]   Bring that a little bit more to the front,
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.180]   forefront for a while and bring the other out.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:36.560]   But like mixing those variables up,
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.400]   but trying to keep the total load the same
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.680]   and always kind of like, do we add a little more?
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.720]   Again, it doesn't have to be major
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:43.600]   and it shouldn't be major.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.680]   You don't want these big jumps.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.160]   You don't go, oh my God, let's move.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.000]   Let's jump into squatting every day.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.200]   You've got to build the capacity to do that.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.560]   It's simple.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.840]   - What role would you say strength has
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.620]   in sports that combine skill and strength?
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.600]   So for me personally, maybe I'll just ask it selfishly,
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.280]   which is grappling, wrestling, MMA.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.360]   - Yeah.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.960]   How about I start with baseball?
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.080]   - Please.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.120]   - No, I would.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:15.960]   - Okay.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.800]   - I know the sport.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.240]   - Baseball and golf are two of my favorite sports.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.400]   No, you don't have to be in shape at all
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.520]   to excel at those sports.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.880]   - Well, here's the thing.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.720]   - There we go.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.780]   We're gonna get this argument.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.560]   - Well, I've got a perfect example
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.440]   because this is why I sell so many transformer bars
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.280]   into the major league baseball.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.080]   So they get these people that come in, these athletes,
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.880]   that have been baseball their whole life.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.680]   It is part of the culture.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.360]   And so they're great athletes.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.920]   They've got all the skill.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.160]   The only thing they have to do
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   is develop a little bit more resilience
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.780]   so that they don't have the injury.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.800]   They can push their training a little bit more.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.680]   That we can add a little bit more force output
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.720]   and be able to recover from it.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.880]   So the only thing they've got to do
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.840]   is add some training,
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.520]   but there's no training culture there.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.560]   So they don't have any experience,
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.020]   which is why they love the transformer bar
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:10.920]   because they don't have to worry
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.920]   about teaching the technique.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.280]   We can actually set the bar on a setting
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.600]   that makes their squats perfect
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:15.560]   by queuing all the stuff
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.320]   with actually not having to coach it.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.440]   Because when you're coaching a room full of athletes,
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.600]   it's really hard to teach the nuance of all this
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.960]   and not sure that all that.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.920]   But that's all that they have to do with these players
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.360]   with a huge level of skill.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.880]   So once you reach a certain level of skill,
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:34.820]   adding strength is the only real forward path.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:38.760]   So that's the basic simple answer to that.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.680]   - So one of the benefits there
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.400]   being like injury prevention actually.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.040]   - Injury prevention, resilience.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.000]   Because especially fighting sports,
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.160]   you're going to be challenged and thrown
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.600]   and other things happen to you.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.440]   And the more resilient you can make your structures,
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.640]   the better you're gonna be.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.040]   Even a cyclist, mountain biking.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:57.920]   Why would they need it?
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.420]   Why would they need to do upper body training?
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.160]   Take a crash, your shoulder's gone.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.040]   You're done, your career's over.
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.840]   Unless you've done a little training.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.040]   So there's value in all this stuff,
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.400]   but the resilience is like, that's huge.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.040]   And then we can overlay strength.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.240]   Where we miss is this focus on strength
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.600]   when we haven't developed quality motor patterns first.
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.720]   So this is a huge thing with children
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.560]   because people wanna know
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.960]   what's the appropriate training age.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.580]   I'd have had my daughter training before my son
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:31.780]   because she developed movement patterns
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.300]   that have better quality earlier.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.660]   There's no age because it's gonna be
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:37.220]   very dependent on the individual.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.780]   There's no point in having adaptation
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:41.220]   if we don't have the right thing to adapt to yet.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.060]   - And that applies to general movement, but also to sport.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:46.620]   So you're saying the skills should be developed first
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.220]   and then the strength applied on top of that.
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:49.300]   - Yep.
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.900]   - Maybe you can educate me,
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:55.700]   but I actually quit lifting and power lifting
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:00.360]   for a long time after I started judo,
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:04.240]   jiu-jitsu, grappling, all this sort of combat sports
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:08.280]   because I found that it was preventing me
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:13.280]   from relaxing my body enough to load in the skill.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:20.900]   - So this isn't a problem with the training.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.160]   This is a problem with you.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.000]   - Yeah.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.800]   So this is actually really, really important.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.800]   The first product I ever released was a loadable mace,
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.040]   a swinging mace.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.720]   And because every power lifter and body,
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.560]   well, not every, but most serious power lifters
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.160]   and bodybuilders, like shoulders,
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.400]   mobility is pretty limited.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.360]   And most of them really, really struggle with this.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.160]   The problem is they've been taught
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.020]   to have tension all the time.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.840]   And that's not good.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.880]   So when we talk about like the joint positions
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.040]   that we were talking about earlier
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.120]   and having those and the muscles
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:01.080]   in the right length and tension relationship,
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:05.560]   athleticism is the speed to relaxation
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.840]   because the counter is speed to contraction.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.440]   Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, right?
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.800]   And so what a mace can do is use that
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.160]   'cause this ties back into a developmental kinesiology
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.520]   'cause a lot of like reset patterns
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.240]   are getting back into these basic movements,
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.000]   but it's as much about relaxation as it is contraction.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:28.840]   Okay?
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.360]   So a mace, we have this weight on a big long lever.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.800]   So if I grab a kettlebell,
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.880]   and this would be like the same movement
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.320]   as a kettlebell halo.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.680]   It is the same movement as a kettlebell.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.860]   But here in the halo, I'm on the whole time.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.020]   With the mace at the proper length
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:47.520]   with the right distribution, you cannot do the movement.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:50.240]   You could not move, force your way through it.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.800]   The only way that you can accomplish that is by relaxing.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.120]   And then now we can contract all the muscles
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.880]   related around that shoulder girdle all at once.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.520]   We're working on, off, on, off, on, off
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.760]   with moving and contracting.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.880]   And now, so what happens a lot of times
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.400]   as this stiffness and tightness happens,
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.440]   if we're in poor positions,
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:17.680]   we start using stabilizer muscles to do the movement.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.720]   And then that's where this stiffness come from.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.820]   So it means that in some of whatever training
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:23.760]   that you're doing,
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.920]   there's a deficit in the movement quality.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.640]   Okay.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:29.800]   Or there's a deficit in the training program
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:30.920]   and you're not recovering from.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.720]   And 80% of the time, that's the right answer, right?
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:35.800]   But yeah, that's where the gap is
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.280]   and learning how to relax.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.480]   And the way a lot of the exercises are taught
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.880]   and have been taught for a long time,
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.400]   which is why there's a big gap.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.760]   And this is why both clinical rehab
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.280]   and all these other components are mixed in my philosophy
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.520]   and what I'm trying to do with Kabuki strength.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.760]   Because I'm looking at holistic movement.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.760]   I'm not looking at powerlifting.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.600]   Base movements are what I want to load
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.880]   and be able to assess on.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:04.640]   But this affects all sports, all activities.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.240]   And strength doesn't have to be that.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.660]   I mean, I'm freaking a thousand pound squatter
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:10.600]   and deadlifter.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:11.960]   If you watch any of my videos
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.320]   where I do like complete quad fallbacks,
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.240]   I don't stretch at all.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.040]   I can usually get close to a full split,
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.760]   like if I want to.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.760]   - What?
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.080]   No, I did not see those videos.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:21.920]   - Okay.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.800]   - That's hard to believe.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.640]   Wow, okay.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.760]   - Well, actually I do.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.740]   I just did one recently,
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:29.720]   a quad fallback with my mace loaded way out to the end,
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.240]   torsioning on both ends of the other.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.220]   And like, I do a lot of weird stuff.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:36.200]   - That's awesome.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.040]   Okay.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.120]   - Squatting doesn't make your hips tight.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.760]   Squatting like shit makes your hips tight.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:46.020]   And so, but there is no perfect world.
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.700]   We're always, our training program isn't quite perfect.
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.780]   Our movement isn't necessarily perfect.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.740]   Like, so you're going to have the needs for this stuff.
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:56.460]   But if you're always have to do some soft tissue work
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:58.860]   to loosen up the same one for that exercise,
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.880]   to be able to get a joint in position,
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   there is a problem.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.380]   And I'm not saying don't do it, do it,
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.160]   because I don't want you to have a joint.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.580]   Like if I can't get my shoulders in a position,
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.480]   I can't do overhead presses
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.240]   because I'm going to compromise my spine position.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.160]   Then I'm going to end up with some other problems, right?
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:16.300]   So go ahead and clean that up so you can get in position,
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:20.340]   but go figure out why it is and fix it.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.780]   And then maybe next, you know, three, four months from now,
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:25.300]   they're going to get a little something else going on.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:29.100]   Fix it, but go understand the deeper root reason of why.
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:32.120]   So I'm, I believe I am the only company
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.340]   manufacturing and selling, you know,
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:35.700]   fascial soft tissue tools.
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.100]   And I'll tell you, I don't want you to use them.
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:41.980]   - 'Cause it's not helping you get to the why,
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.700]   why it was caused in the first place.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:44.580]   - Yeah.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.780]   The goal, the goal, the perfect state
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.640]   is not having to use them.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.260]   Reality is you're going to have to use them
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:53.020]   from time to time because the world's not perfect.
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:53.980]   - Yeah.
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:56.380]   - So your discovery is a hundred percent on point.
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:59.880]   - Well, there's another side to combat sports.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.380]   When you're beginning a particular combat sport,
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:09.040]   strength can be a negative because human psychology,
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.100]   because you can get away with a lot when you're stronger.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:12.940]   - Yes, you can.
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.500]   - So if your mind is strong enough
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:19.400]   to where you can just turn off that advantage
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.500]   and be a beginner truly in a particular art,
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.780]   that's probably the best way to do it.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:26.120]   - But you can get away and then you don't learn.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:26.960]   - Yeah.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.060]   - Yeah.
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:28.900]   - It's hard.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:32.320]   It's hard not to use the little advantages you have
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.320]   because like jujitsu is a big hit on the ego for,
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.980]   you know, especially guys,
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:43.740]   you know, when like a smaller person just destroys you,
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:46.260]   dominates you, when you can, I don't know,
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:49.700]   deadlift whatever number of pounds.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:52.380]   And it's hard not to use that strength
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:56.940]   to then resist the, slow the ultimate destruction
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.900]   by like 120 pound.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.580]   - But that, and that's why I recommend
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:02.480]   developing the skill quality first,
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.200]   but it doesn't mean that you can't.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.320]   - You can't, that's right.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.240]   - You can still do it.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.720]   So that don't take it as a like,
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.640]   oh, I can't go that direction.
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.960]   That's fine, but understand those things.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.200]   And then also understand
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.280]   that jujitsu is additional load on the body.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.120]   - Yeah.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.120]   - So you have to, you can't just add it on top.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:18.960]   - Yeah.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.720]   - You've got to taper back the other,
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.080]   you're gonna have to make a,
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:24.760]   I'm sorry, you may not want to hear it,
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.200]   but you're not gonna be able to do as much
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.480]   and add that here.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.320]   - Yeah.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.700]   - So you have to compromise
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:34.460]   because your total volume still has to be there.
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:35.340]   And there's not, unfortunately,
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.140]   not really a way to measure
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:39.260]   what the jujitsu volume is with this.
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.660]   So you've got to take a look at that.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:44.380]   And that's where like measuring like heart rate variability
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.220]   or other stuff can be useful.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.640]   So you can see what is happening for me
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.500]   from a sympathetic versus parasympathetic
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.580]   nervous system standpoint.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.740]   - Yeah, making sure your body recovers efficiently
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.880]   and trying to put numbers to it.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.700]   You mentioned Kabuki strength.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.180]   You run the Kabuki strength lab,
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:04.540]   previously called the Elite Performance Center in Oregon.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.200]   You called it the perfect gym.
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.980]   What makes for the perfect strength training gym?
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:11.820]   - Where I called it the perfect gym?
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.540]   - In a video somewhere I watched.
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:15.100]   - Oh man.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.960]   I mean, that's where my testing grounds
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.340]   for developing all this stuff was through the years.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:22.460]   And so this is, like I said,
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:24.160]   I started developing relationships
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.460]   with the best developmental kinesiologist in the US,
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.020]   the best, arguably the best
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:31.940]   or most well-known physical therapist in the world,
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:35.260]   the best spine biomechanist in the world.
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:36.900]   I started doing continuing education
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.980]   with these clinical courses and learning this stuff
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:41.620]   and going, but how does it work in my world?
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.100]   And then I started lecturing with them
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:43.920]   and all this other stuff,
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.420]   but the lab was like, where do we test this stuff?
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:50.540]   And so let me get to a point, there's three things.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.460]   There's always three things.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:57.460]   So to be a success, to achieve success,
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.960]   I believe there's three things
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.280]   that really, really come into place.
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:05.720]   And it's the right methodology,
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.920]   the right tools and the right environment.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.260]   And so it was all about building that.
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:18.000]   And so the methodologies came from a lot of that different,
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.340]   that gray area, interaction of clinical
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.320]   with sports science, right?
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:26.080]   And then the tools I had to start creating and designing,
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.720]   and then the environment is having this focused environment
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.800]   of people that want to do better and push each other
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   and having community and culture, right?
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:38.200]   I ended up building these connections, this network.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.080]   Everything that I'm doing with my businesses
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.480]   is trying to create that into a scalable fashion.
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.860]   And so I'm building the groundwork
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.240]   because to have a system that like, yeah,
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.400]   I had clinicals on site that knew exactly what we were doing
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.000]   and when it's me and a few people in a small team
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.280]   and all this stuff, we're all just like easy to manage.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.400]   And you can see these, there's other models around this.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.200]   So I've been other areas since maybe whenever it was,
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.000]   I filmed that video that said that,
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.400]   that they have that same model.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.440]   And it's taken probably about a decade usually
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.120]   to develop that, you know,
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.440]   and having the right people in this community,
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.200]   they can create this network and all this stuff, right?
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.680]   Except they still don't have the best tools
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.520]   because Kabuki strength didn't exist.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.780]   (laughing)
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.280]   And so out of that was,
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.560]   is essentially I started building this business
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.400]   and people like,
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.800]   when did you know how all this stuff was connected?
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.400]   And I'm like, I don't know.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.280]   I didn't, I just started creating on the outset
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.200]   the things that worked until finally I'm like,
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.680]   oh, I'm recreating a scalable version of this stuff.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.940]   Here's the methodologies and a coaching platform
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:46.280]   that we can manage clients around the globe
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.120]   and see what's working
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.600]   and not based on the scientific principles of training.
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.440]   Right?
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:51.800]   How do we create that into a database
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.840]   that now we can train new coaches
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.280]   and they can use those same metrics and tools
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.920]   to create programs that are tailored
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.640]   to fit person's individual needs, right?
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:04.000]   Now, how do we integrate that with assessment
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.640]   and clinical care assessment and all these other pieces?
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.400]   So there's a lot of work in that.
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.880]   And so that's where Kabuki strength is the genesis,
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.500]   but we have, we call our gym, the Kabuki strength lab.
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:19.560]   Literally people find about our gym in the neighborhood
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.720]   and they're like, how long have you been here?
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.400]   Why do I not know about this?
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:25.120]   We don't advertise our gym at all.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.680]   They're like, that makes no sense.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.840]   Well, that's 'cause the only reason
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.280]   is to have a testing environment
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.720]   for the tools and methodology
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.400]   and having enough people to have the culture and fit
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.820]   and to be able to be part of the experiment.
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:42.580]   - What about the environment of the feel of it?
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.120]   The actual gym?
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.880]   There's a, I don't know, a grunginess to it.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.280]   I've recently became a member of Planet Fitness.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.960]   (both laughing)
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   For reasons that have to do more with the heat in Austin
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:59.400]   that sometimes I need to put in time on the treadmill.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.240]   I don't like that gym.
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.640]   - I don't have any judgment, honestly, I don't.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:06.000]   - The best gyms I've been in are kind of dirty.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.400]   - You walk in and you know that work is to be done.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.240]   - Yes.
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.500]   - There's not another reason to do there.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.360]   It is, the environment is tight.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.860]   There's a big piece of that.
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:18.720]   I know it's studied sociologically, I believe.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.520]   I just, I just butchered that word too.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.480]   (both laughing)
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:25.960]   But the intensity, when you start growing a space,
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.440]   the intensity drops.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.920]   And so I had that experience when we grew,
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.560]   we went from a 4,000 foot to a 9,000 square foot gym
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:34.700]   at one time.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:38.280]   And everybody's like, it doesn't feel the same.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.680]   Like if people are complaining for years,
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:40.640]   we've shrunk it back down.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.280]   Well, we're down to 3,500 square feet
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.120]   and it creates that intensity.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.440]   It creates the closest,
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.520]   the connection with the people around you.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.440]   And then, like I said, the grunginess,
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.720]   like you go in, you know the intention when you walk in.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.280]   That environment creates that tension.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.000]   But when I speak environment, it's not just the,
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.480]   it's not the physical, it's the people.
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.360]   - But you know when the gym is a little bit beat up?
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.200]   - Yes.
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:06.500]   - It also tells a story, like there's a history to it.
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:09.680]   You could tell that not only is there work to be done,
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.520]   that work has been done here.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.360]   - Yes.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.560]   - Like battles have been fought.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.760]   There's something to that where you're just
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.760]   in a long line of people that fought and won.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.680]   - And we could get into a whole nother space,
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.920]   so this would be a whole nother topic,
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:28.320]   but that existing energy of a space.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.400]   - I mean, we mentioned offline Joe Rogan.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.440]   He talks about the same with comedy clubs.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.960]   There's certain clubs that just have a history.
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.040]   There's an energy there.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:41.000]   You can get all woo-woo, but you know, it's there.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.240]   - It's a real thing, I think.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.880]   You walk in and you can feel it.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:44.720]   - And you feel it.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.200]   - You feel it, yeah.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:50.720]   - That makes me feel that somehow all of us humans
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.240]   are connected in ways that's hard to describe,
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:56.780]   even the ones who are no longer here.
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:01.780]   Just the greatness that once was is still in the walls,
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:04.400]   in the space, present there.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.240]   - Yeah.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.160]   - And we somehow can plug into that energy.
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:11.640]   - Yeah, it's, we can go down a path there.
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.600]   - There's something really powerful there.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.480]   You've also mentioned a bunch of cool equipment
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:19.520]   that you've developed as part of Kabuki Strength.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.040]   Probably a little bit of that has to do
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.960]   with your engineering education,
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.920]   but also just generally with the spirit
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:29.060]   of the innovator that you are.
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:33.080]   What are some cool, maybe revolutionary pieces
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.360]   of equipment that you're particularly proud of
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.760]   or just you've been obsessed with recently?
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:39.960]   - Yeah. - That you're developing?
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.080]   - Love to talk about that.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.360]   So we've got some wild, crazy stuff
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.360]   that just came out and is coming out too.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:50.320]   So everything that we create and release at Kabuki Strength,
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.240]   the industry hasn't seen before.
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.320]   There's stuff that's basic foundational
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.480]   that's been around forever because it works.
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.800]   But there's always more.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.280]   It could be better.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.280]   And why are we not looking at these things,
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.320]   these foundational things?
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.160]   So when people are coming up with novel things,
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.340]   they end up being way different outside the perspective.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:14.040]   And I'm coming up with things that are way different
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:17.520]   that are plays on what we already know works.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.840]   So we talked about the transform bar,
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:19.920]   the only bar in the world.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.680]   We can manipulate spinal mechanics.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.160]   So everything for me from a design concept
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:29.640]   that we develop is all about creating products
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:33.800]   that can rapidly accommodate to the variability
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.800]   of an individual's leverages, mobility, and training needs.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.940]   And that's gonna also create and distill down the size
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:45.160]   and scope of space that we need,
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:48.480]   which is gonna continue to be an ongoing thing.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.220]   Check out my Instagram after this, and you'll see,
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:52.420]   I put an entire gym on the bed of my truck
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:56.040]   and went on vacation last week, drove to the desert.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:56.880]   - Oh no, that's so awesome.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:59.640]   - And by entire gym, I mean squat rack,
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.360]   full compliment of our specialty bars,
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.640]   a horizontal and vertical pulley system,
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.520]   handheld weights, shoulder,
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.920]   like a complete, an entire gym in product
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.880]   that took up the space, the size of this bed right here.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.880]   - That's incredible.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.000]   - Because of the design scope of what we have.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.920]   So the cool thing is that there's two other bars
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.440]   that fit our biomechanically sound barbell lines.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.360]   We talked about the transformer bar.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.760]   The other two are built on this thing
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.800]   I called playground physics.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:31.160]   So we have these bars with handles
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.520]   that are off parallel with the axis.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.360]   So they've been around the market for a long time.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.280]   One is a hex bar or a trap bar.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.560]   Another one is a, it's a pressing bar
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:46.240]   with the handles turned as well.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.580]   And both of them suck.
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:49.420]   They're horrible.
[01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.620]   Anytime, any lifter knows if you pick it up,
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.240]   it's going to break your wrist and crush into your face.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.280]   And it just doesn't feel good pressing,
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:00.260]   but it alleviates the strain on the wrist.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.800]   So people use it for that reason.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.720]   And the trap bar, same thing.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.600]   It's always diving forward in your hand.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.840]   So it's kind of limited.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.200]   It's also limited in use
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.160]   because you could do a lot more with it.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.920]   So these bars are really cool, playground physics.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.220]   So as soon as the center of rotation
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:24.760]   is on the same axis as the center of mass
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:29.180]   and the handle is off center, you have a teeter-totter.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:33.280]   So a teeter-totter has a balance point,
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.620]   but it's infinitely perfect.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.180]   So technically you can never find it.
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:37.280]   It's always going to be sitting on one side
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.680]   or the other in a playground.
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.360]   And that's what these bars are designed.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.280]   So you got instability right here.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.120]   You can't find the center.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.400]   The bar is always trying to tip in your hands
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.240]   on the trap bar.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.440]   So you can't do carries with it
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.560]   'cause you're doing for momentum
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.960]   and it wants to dip on you, right?
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.320]   The Swiss bar wants to crush your face.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.280]   Well, what do we do?
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.320]   We just make a swing.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:57.440]   Put center of mass below center of rotation.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.880]   And what does it do?
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.580]   Oh, it always finds center.
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:05.920]   So the handles on our pressing bar,
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:09.120]   it's arced so that the handles are above center of rotation.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.600]   And then every angle,
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.160]   instead of just being a certain fixed angles,
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.180]   each angle is based on the width,
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:17.760]   the average width of an individual.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.320]   So the internal and external rotational bias
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.080]   is based of the shoulder, is based on the width,
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.320]   leaving just a little bit left
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.320]   because we talked about the lat being a stabilizer.
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.680]   You still need to have a little bit of cue
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:30.760]   of external rotation to engage that as a stabilizer.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:31.600]   Boom.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.440]   Now, all of a sudden you have a bar
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.000]   and I kid you not, this is a great story.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.880]   Major League Baseball, when I presented it,
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.880]   every head strength coach for a Major League Baseball team,
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.720]   maybe not every, but damn near most of them,
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:42.840]   have bad shoulders.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.680]   They can't press, they've got shoulder surgeries, so on.
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.320]   And so we're showing, they love all our stuff.
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.760]   And I'm like, "Hey, I've got this cool prototype
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.960]   I wanna show you, it's a pressing bar."
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you know,
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:54.680]   Major League Baseball is a little hesitant on pressing
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:56.520]   'cause of the dangers for the shoulder."
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:00.200]   And I haven't been able to take a bar to my chest.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.040]   I mean, I'd really love to.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.360]   It's been five years since I've been able
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:07.560]   to XX train and I'm like, "Just try it."
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.440]   Like, I can't even get a bar to my chest without pain.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.280]   I'm like, "Just try it."
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.120]   Put it in there.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.040]   Ooh, that feels good.
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:15.280]   Now, the arc makes it actually three inches deeper.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.560]   So people are automatically scared.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.560]   I can't do that 'cause that's an extra range of motion.
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.880]   I'm like, "Ooh, put a plate on there."
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.720]   They're doing it.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.000]   By that time, the staff's like, they're all standing around.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.120]   You see like, "What's going on?"
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.880]   "Put two plates on."
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.400]   You see the, just like, he gets up.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.600]   "How do you feel?"
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.840]   Like, "I feel fine.
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.800]   No pain at all."
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.920]   I did this with five teams,
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:41.920]   with five of the, it happening repeatedly five times.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.560]   And every one of them worked up to two plates
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.500]   and did reps varied with zero pain
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.520]   to a three inch greater range of motion.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.340]   'Cause what did we do?
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:51.320]   We stacked all the joints
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:52.680]   and we provided stability at the end.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.400]   We balanced internal and external rotation.
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:56.960]   I mean, just basic playground physics
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:58.240]   and it changed the game.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.440]   Now we get a greater range of motion
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.600]   with a greater training effect
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.680]   with the negative stresses removed.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.820]   Our trap bar opened up one side,
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.780]   which there was already something like that out there.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:11.040]   Created, it pops up so you can pick up,
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.000]   take the weights on and off.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.440]   It's got a built-in jack.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.000]   And then created the high handle position,
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:16.840]   which already did it.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.240]   Everybody uses the high handle on a trap bar.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.920]   They just don't know why they like it.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.280]   The handle that's on center, we offset just a little bit.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.320]   Not enough to make a difference
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.200]   on the range of motion lift or even notice visibly,
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.480]   but it still has the same effect.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.080]   So both handles now have that.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.160]   We added the option of different handle sizes
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.360]   based on whatever your needs are,
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.440]   even a one that rolls to develop a grip.
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.360]   And then different widths that you could choose from
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.120]   based on whether you're training a teen athlete
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:43.440]   or a seven foot six NBA player or a NFL lineman
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:47.680]   so that we can accommodate for all these differences.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.940]   And so, and then now it becomes the most functional
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.720]   all around bar around
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.280]   because now you can do carries with it.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.960]   You can do split squats with it.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.320]   You could do curls with it because it goes around the body.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:58.480]   You can do overhead presses
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.160]   because you don't have a thing that gets in your way
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.720]   and you can flip it up into position.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.680]   You can do bent over rows and not run into your shins.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.160]   You can do seal rows off of a bench.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.480]   You can do ab rollouts.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.760]   You could, should I go on?
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:10.600]   Yeah, so you could use it as like the main bar.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.280]   The best multi-purpose bar around.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.640]   You got a home gym, one bar.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:16.440]   Like how do you develop totally new equipment like this?
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.520]   I scratch it on paper.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:23.000]   Maybe weld some cut up and weld up a prototype.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]   But usually I just hand the scratched up paper
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.480]   to my engineering manager.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.160]   And that's what he says his job is
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:32.040]   to distill my chicken scratch into something real.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.560]   And then that team picks it up.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.120]   But in the old days, starting out,
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.700]   I just walk out and do it.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.000]   You talk about engineering.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.840]   I'm actually more, I work more of an artist fashion.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:45.920]   It's in my head and I just go create with no plans.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.320]   And so they have to pick that up
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.320]   and actually do the engineering and testing and all that.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.080]   And then we got two other products came out this year.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.280]   Freaking wild.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.880]   Are you familiar with training with a flywheel?
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.520]   No, it's a flywheel.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.440]   Maybe I am.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.200]   A flywheel is a spinning object
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.200]   that creates an inertial mass.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.480]   And then it reverses direction.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.880]   So whatever you put into it, and there's ones out there,
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:10.520]   but ours is the first patent pending.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.640]   That's everything all in one unit.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.380]   So it's a floor-based as well as a horizontal.
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:17.600]   So you can basically do any pulley movement in the world.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.640]   And now everything that you put into it
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.240]   on a concentric force, it whips right back
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:23.640]   as peak centric load.
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:24.480]   Gotcha.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.520]   So it's an accelerating whipping motion.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.120]   It just, yeah, basically.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:29.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.680]   I mean, okay, I have trouble imagining exactly.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.560]   Many of the things you're describing,
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.920]   I suppose have to be experienced, right?
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:37.840]   Yes.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.160]   'Cause there's a magic to it.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.660]   And there's a lot of research they've been around.
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:43.100]   They're adopted more heavily in Europe,
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.800]   quite heavily in Europe, but not as much in the US
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.480]   because they sell them as a be all end all tool,
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.320]   which they're not.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:51.200]   They're crazy for what they do, but it's not the,
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.280]   it's another tool.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:55.840]   And so we have a very high quality unit now
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.640]   that is half the cost of everybody else's
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.360]   because the innovation of a movable mount point
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.360]   that for them, you have to have two pieces of equipment.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.680]   We have one.
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.680]   So, and then a few other things,
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.360]   better platform to be able to do things
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.800]   and that we can do what we call off-platform work,
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.240]   which allows us to do movements like punches
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.040]   and standups, things like that.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.920]   And then I've got a handheld weight coming out next month
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.360]   that we can actually play with.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.840]   So varying the load with it,
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.960]   never leaving your hand by changing the leverage point.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.400]   And so what that-
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:31.400]   - What exercise are we talking about here?
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.960]   - Anything that would be a dumbbell or a kettlebell movement.
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.320]   So it functions, it does the function of a kettlebell,
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.320]   a dumbbell, and what we call a center mass bell,
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:42.040]   as well as provides variable loading within a range.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.860]   - So how can you change, like, how can you change the load?
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.480]   - Because load, well, we don't actually change the load.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:52.640]   We change the torque on the joint that we're working,
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:53.660]   which is the same.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:55.380]   That's actually what is creating the force, right?
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.380]   So if I'm doing a front raise,
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:00.340]   it's where this downward force is
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.120]   times the distance away, right?
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.560]   Which also then makes it no force
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:05.960]   when I've got at the bottom of the front raise,
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.320]   which is why it's so easy.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.960]   With this, it's like a kettlebell.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:12.740]   It's offset, except it has three different handles,
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.160]   but it's offset just that a kettlebell,
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.760]   you can't do it because the offset so far,
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.640]   it becomes a wrist movement.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.640]   So ours has three different sizes
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:22.240]   and the offset just enough so that you can pick,
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.440]   if I put it in a front raise position or a curl position,
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.360]   I could put it in an outward position
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:29.720]   and the force is almost what it is at the top,
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:30.560]   but then I get to the top
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.260]   and it's the same exact or the curl.
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:34.680]   So I can actually change the force curve in the movement.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.080]   And then I can just release the pressure a little bit
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:38.240]   and let it swing into position
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.680]   and keep doing a drop set with never letting it down.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.640]   Yeah, so it's got a really nice texture grip
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.920]   that allows you to hold it in different positions.
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.920]   And then the load offset is just enough
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.480]   that it doesn't overpower the wrist.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.980]   And then you got different hand sizes
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:52.000]   so that you can maximize this relationship
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.360]   and hit whatever joint that you're applying.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.760]   - That sounds incredible.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.520]   - It's really freaking, well, it's awesome
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:59.520]   'cause you can, because of the variable load,
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.320]   now I could go straight from front raises
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:03.680]   to side raises or rear or curl because--
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:04.520]   - Without like putting it down.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:05.400]   - Because I don't have to put it down.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:08.620]   So now my time under tension goes through the roof.
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:10.760]   And by the way, the same effect with a flywheel trainer,
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.040]   because the variable,
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.540]   whatever you put into it is what it kicks back.
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:17.000]   So you have an constant time under tension
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.280]   'cause there's no rest points either.
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:19.400]   So all this stuff is working
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.560]   on maximizing time under tension, which anyway,
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.800]   it's cool stuff. - That's fascinating.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.480]   - Anyway, I get excited.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.280]   - Well, let me ask you about another thing
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.120]   you've already mentioned,
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.760]   but I find this really interesting,
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.320]   which is barefoot running.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:38.320]   And your sort of company,
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:42.360]   Barefoot Athletics, B-E-A-R,
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:46.260]   and the tagline is optimizing the human to ground interface.
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:51.100]   We've talked about this a little bit with the power lifting.
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:56.100]   How do you think about the foot ground interface?
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:01.780]   - It's interesting that we know
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:05.220]   that we should train all these parts of our body
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:08.220]   to be able to be stronger, be more resilient.
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:13.920]   But we think that the foot is different,
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.040]   that we need to package it and modify it.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:19.800]   And somehow that that's the science of making it healthy.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.120]   Where I challenge people, think about that.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.000]   Like first thing you do in the morning
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.880]   is roll out of bed and put your weightlifting belt on
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:29.360]   and wrap it on tight and wear it
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.000]   till you go to bed at night.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.800]   Do it with your shoulders, your knees.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.640]   Put it, wake up and put some knee wraps on, okay?
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:38.520]   And elbow wraps and see what happens.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:42.100]   One, you'll get weaker, you'll lose movement capacity
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:44.140]   and you'll start affecting other areas of the body
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:46.100]   very negatively because they will start picking up
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:48.140]   the compensation for those joints
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.580]   that are not moving properly.
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:51.760]   This is it.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.740]   What shoes are for is to protect you from the environment,
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:59.620]   from cuts and abrasions and heat and things like that.
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:03.620]   But the foot, let me, the mind blowing
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:07.340]   is like every other area of the body.
[01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:10.320]   You need to use it and you need to strengthen it
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.160]   and you need to learn to control it.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.000]   That's it.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.960]   That's all I have to say about the subject, okay?
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.600]   It's that simple but somehow we have been sold
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.780]   entire industries like the orthotics industry.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:25.060]   It's completely false.
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:27.320]   Meta analysis of the data shows that orthotics
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.960]   do nothing beyond temporary relief from pain
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.360]   over a six, eight week period of time
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.000]   and provide no long-term benefit.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.880]   And I can't tell you how many people
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:37.980]   I've eliminated back or knee or hip pain
[01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:40.780]   from working on strengthening and controlling
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:42.620]   the foot and ankle complex.
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:45.180]   We believe we've villainized and said,
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:48.240]   a low arch is a condition that needs fixed.
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:52.740]   Like when it really is just controlling
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:54.740]   the foot and ankle complex and how they relate
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:56.220]   to each other and how we use that.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:59.940]   Is it like, go put on boxing gloves in the morning
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:02.380]   and do that for the next 20 years and see what happens.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:04.520]   It's not about finding the right shoe that fits
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:07.420]   because your foot has been deformed.
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.820]   And so I'm not like some wacky, like,
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.780]   oh, you gotta be barefoot forever or do this.
[01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:15.580]   Like, no, I'm just saying, go spend some time using it.
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:17.460]   Strengthen it, learn to control it
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:19.140]   and you will work better in a shoe.
[01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:22.220]   But the whole running shoe movement with the raised heel,
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:27.220]   that was the person that suggested that to Nike way back
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:29.500]   when they were trying to figure out what to do,
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:32.940]   the reason, and he says it's the worst thing
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:37.940]   that he ever did because we were coming from an era
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:39.280]   of people wearing heeled shoes,
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.640]   which by the way came from stirrups way back in the day.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.640]   That's where the whole heel came from is to go into stirrup,
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:45.500]   but then it went into fashion.
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.560]   And then the running craze started coming around
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:48.460]   in the '70s.
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.120]   They're starting to push this, the general mass population,
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.120]   and they realized that they were causing injuries.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.820]   And like, what are we gonna do?
[01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:58.320]   Well, that's because everybody was in this position
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.600]   and had a shortened calf muscle.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.560]   And it's like, well, to work around,
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.160]   let's just put a heel on it so we don't injure them.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.680]   That's it.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.520]   And now, because the raised heel,
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:09.760]   you gotta raise the toe.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.800]   And then now with that, if you go stand on something
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:15.880]   and pull your inner toe in, and in a squat position,
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.040]   just reach down and do it,
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.680]   you'll see that you have no control over internal
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:22.320]   and external rotation of your leg.
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:23.160]   You don't.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.000]   Or your foot.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.480]   And you actually have to put a support in for the arch
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.300]   to be able to passively control those structures.
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:36.240]   It's just Band-Aid on top of Band-Aid on top of Band-Aid.
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:37.560]   Use it, strengthen it.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.320]   If you wanna wear some shoes 'cause they look good
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:40.720]   or fancy, I'm like, I have no problem.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:41.960]   I mean, I go out on a wife,
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:45.320]   my wife will put on some high heels every now and again.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:48.080]   But all I'm saying is, use your foot.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.500]   My 1,000-pound squat, my 1,000-pound deadlift,
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:51.520]   we're done barefoot.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:53.680]   I'm not trying to sell you shoes.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:56.140]   Go do it with no shoe.
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.320]   That's what I've been promoting.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.200]   I did that for six years and I promoted it.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.160]   But people ask me, well, what do I do?
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.820]   Because my gym requires shoes.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:06.280]   Where do I go?
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:09.400]   And then I go, well, you could pick up
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:11.440]   these other finger shoes or whatever.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.440]   And they go, man, my wife won't have sex with me
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.280]   if I do that.
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:17.680]   And I go, I know, mine either.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:19.760]   Trust me, I'm not making this up.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:21.680]   Everybody in that market markets to one segment
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.560]   and they're still missing some gaps
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:26.720]   because they still have a little bit too narrow of a toe box.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.040]   And if you're lifting, you have the opportunity
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.960]   to really get that splay and start working
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:31.160]   on this stuff better.
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.840]   So I just wanted to create a shoe.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:34.840]   These ones are odd colored
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:36.640]   'cause it's a partnership with Kabuki.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.640]   Normally we've got a black or a gray,
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:41.400]   low top, high top, sticks to the ground for lifting
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:42.360]   so we can do that.
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.560]   And very pliable.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.060]   It's a moccasin.
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.680]   It's a modern day moccasin.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:49.160]   But looks okay that you can wear it around in other areas
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.320]   if you so choose.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:54.280]   You know what the number one healthcare cost in America is?
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:55.640]   - What's that?
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:00.640]   - Diabetes, heart disease, cancer, low back pain.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:09.200]   - Now what do you attribute low back pain to?
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.240]   - Well, it's attributed to a lot of things,
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:14.000]   but inability to control spinal position,
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.720]   which starts happening from some breathing issues.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.160]   It also happens from the foot.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.000]   So there's a lot of stuff,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.960]   but everything that I do actually focuses on improving this.
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:24.800]   - Yeah.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.840]   - And it all starts with the feet.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:27.760]   - This is one thing.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.080]   Like this doesn't affect breathing,
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.240]   but so it does actually affect breathing
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.900]   to some extent and spinal stabilization.
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:37.040]   So the raised heel and toe will make you stride further
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:38.880]   because of just how it operates.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.880]   But that overstride is a result of opening this.
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:44.600]   So we open the pelvis and diaphragm.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:46.400]   Did we talk about that and the impact that that has
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:47.280]   for controlling and spine?
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.620]   Yeah, I think we touched on that.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:52.520]   But all this stuff plays together.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.680]   - So the gait affects that.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.280]   And so the shoe affects the gait.
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:56.880]   And then so it's all connected.
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:57.820]   - All connected.
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:00.360]   Let me be very purposeful
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.760]   with some conversation here though.
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:03.700]   We've talked about periodization.
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:04.640]   This was a big gap.
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:06.480]   So people go, yeah, well,
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:07.880]   when people started running with those,
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.220]   they started having injuries
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:12.040]   back when the finger company produced those
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.800]   and didn't do the education around this very simple concept.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.720]   You do not walk into the gym if you haven't squatted
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:19.840]   and start squatting 225 for max reps every week,
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:22.100]   day or every day over day.
[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:23.460]   And that's what people did
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.680]   because they weren't told that
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:29.120]   you need to build the capacity to do this.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.760]   You go wear these and walk around in your office
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:32.800]   or wherever all day long,
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:33.960]   your feet are gonna hurt.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.060]   They're gonna be sore.
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:38.560]   Do it for 10% of your time.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:42.760]   Do that for a month, then add some.
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:45.120]   That will build the capacity to do this.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:46.640]   And then that's gonna start having
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.240]   the ability to strengthen, manage the foot.
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:49.320]   And there's a whole lot of other stuff.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:51.800]   I've got videos on things that you can do.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:53.200]   Buy whatever you want
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:55.300]   or just spend some time out of them.
[01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:57.800]   That's all that I want people to do
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:59.600]   because it is so simple
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.920]   and it has such a profound impact.
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:02.760]   - It does.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.080]   What I did--
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:05.760]   - I noticed when I walked in.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:07.480]   I was like, "Oh, hey, you're spending some time
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.080]   "without the shoes on."
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.120]   (both laughing)
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.080]   - Well, what I did,
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:14.600]   I think it's already now two years ago
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.040]   when I was doing a lot of running,
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:18.020]   I'd do a 10-mile run.
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:21.000]   I would take my shoes off for the last half mile
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.200]   and I'd run like that.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:24.200]   And that was, for me, really helpful
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:26.920]   to ensure that I have proper form.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:29.800]   Form that minimizes pain on the way I run.
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:31.140]   I still like shoes.
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:32.280]   I benefit a lot from shoes,
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:33.480]   the protection they provide,
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:37.480]   but it's for running we're referring to,
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.240]   especially trail running and so on.
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:41.720]   And in the city when there's glass
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:43.400]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:45.600]   But it's really important to have minimal
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:46.920]   sort of protection on your feet.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:50.360]   For me, at least it was to figure out
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.800]   the ways that my form, basic movement,
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.980]   and the positioning in the foot,
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:57.560]   the impact of the foot,
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.200]   and everything, the lower leg,
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.320]   the entirety of the torso, really,
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:06.280]   how it's improperly positioned
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:08.920]   in terms for the objective of minimizing pain.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:13.320]   And the barefoot running really helped fix that for me.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.200]   'Cause I figured out that I need to take shorter steps,
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:20.340]   more frequent, all those kinds of things.
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:22.080]   And that really helps you figure that out.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.880]   - Like, let's be realist about stuff.
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:28.720]   Like, spend some time using it, strengthen it.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.600]   And I've got some great ways to do that
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:32.480]   and learn how to do that.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:33.660]   So, yeah.
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:36.160]   - What is a good diet for strength development?
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.920]   I've, just to give you some context,
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:40.040]   I've been eating mostly meat.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.680]   Not for strength, mostly for mental performance.
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:44.280]   I just enjoy it.
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.780]   - Yes, you need to have a base level
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:50.080]   of protein building blocks for tissue, right?
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:53.200]   We need to have enough fats to be able to have
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:56.340]   hormones work and key processes in the body.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:58.680]   We need to have, well, you don't need to have
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:01.060]   from a performance aspect carbohydrates necessarily,
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.280]   because the other ones can convert into injury sources.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:05.400]   But for a performance athlete,
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.280]   carbohydrates can be very beneficial as well.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:14.280]   So, I look at it as you need a base level fats,
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:16.080]   you need a base level of proteins,
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:18.660]   and then you adjust the carbohydrate intake
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:19.840]   based on the needs.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:22.380]   I'm not anti-carbohydrate by any means.
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:25.480]   'Cause a lot of people, well, they look at me now
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.840]   when they see how lean I am,
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:28.320]   and they jump to a conclusion.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.120]   You must be keto, you must be carnivore,
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:30.960]   you must be whatever.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:33.880]   And it's like, so losing and gaining weight
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.680]   is simply eating less or eating more.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:41.660]   I mean, and we get so complicated.
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:44.760]   Oh, what's your fasting window?
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.320]   If I'm doing fasting, it's just because it works
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.280]   with my environment.
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.760]   Sometimes I do it, sometimes I don't.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:56.000]   All that does is control how much calories that you take.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.120]   Big success with keto and carnivore diets.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:03.120]   It's hard to eat a lot and put on weight with those diets.
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:06.940]   Protein actually has a thermogenic effect.
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:09.840]   And so, you have to have a massive amount of fats
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.680]   if you have a only meat diet,
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:13.760]   because you can literally starve to death.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.420]   There's a show where they put people out in the wilderness,
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:18.900]   and this guy, the one that won,
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:19.740]   one of the ones I looked at,
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:24.360]   and they threw him way up past the way out there.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.400]   There was nothing, but he somehow got a caribou
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.240]   and killed it.
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:30.560]   And he still lost a pound a day for 30 days with a caribou,
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.800]   because his fat was stolen by a...
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:36.240]   And he could eat all the meat he wanted,
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.840]   and then he almost got pulled because his weight loss.
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:42.360]   But that isn't actually a performance.
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:45.360]   So, those type keto and carnivore are not performance diets.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:48.520]   So, they're not gonna be as effective
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:53.440]   at supplying the energy needs for high capacity training.
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:54.640]   So, don't get me wrong, you can do training,
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:59.640]   but you can be a successful athlete with a vegan diet,
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:05.280]   but it's not as easy to do it with other diets.
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:07.780]   So, and you're missing some base nutrients.
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.620]   So many nutrients in meat.
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:14.480]   I believe having greens in your diet is really beneficial.
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.880]   Lots of research, but there's people in the other worlds
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:18.200]   that argue that you don't need them,
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:21.320]   but they help clear organs, provide micronutrients,
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:22.320]   all this sort of stuff.
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.660]   So, I eat simply a whole well-rounded diet,
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:29.840]   and I've gone from, I can go from 285 pounds,
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:32.400]   squatting a ton of weight, to eating less
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:35.780]   and dropping all the way down to seven, 8% body fat
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:39.040]   with veins standing out everywhere without a tissue on me,
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:42.480]   just with amazing, great tasting food.
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.040]   To lose weight or be healthy does not mean
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.840]   that you need to eat flavorless, bland food.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:51.360]   So, that's the main point I try to get across.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:54.440]   - It's eat less to lose weight, eat more to gain weight.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.560]   - Yep, make sure that you've got enough protein.
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.640]   Make sure that you've got your micronutrients covered,
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:01.080]   which is gonna cover by eating real food.
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:03.280]   Don't go low fat, no fat.
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:05.240]   If you want a performance, don't go no carb,
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:07.640]   but if it works, any of those things.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.480]   So, diet approach.
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:12.960]   When you look at diets, understand that they're,
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.040]   how aggressive they are.
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:16.320]   So, like keto can make you lose a lot of weight.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.320]   Carnivore can make you lose a lot of weight.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:22.400]   A lot of that up front is actually dropping glycogen stores.
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:23.840]   So, you're actually just reducing water
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.680]   in your muscle and fat tissue,
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.200]   so, which is why it isn't as great for a performance diet.
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:34.200]   But understand that every diet also has a level of discipline
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.000]   and does it fit your lifestyle.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000]   So, I suggest people don't find a diet.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.760]   You need to find a lifestyle because that's what's sustainable.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:46.040]   I hate the word diet to begin with.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:50.160]   What behaviors are sustainable?
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:52.400]   And then do that, and then over time,
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.200]   the things you'll get to where you need to get.
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:58.480]   Diet itself, just by the name of it,
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:02.500]   is not sustainable because it is a short term thing
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:03.640]   to get somewhere.
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:07.000]   - Yeah, I tend to try to measure it
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.960]   'cause I definitely have a love-hate relationship with food.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.360]   I tend to look back and say,
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:17.760]   by following this particular protocol, lifestyle, whatever,
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:20.260]   what was the level of happiness?
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:21.100]   - Yes.
[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:24.560]   - So, not like weight loss or weight gain
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:25.500]   or all those kinds of things.
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:26.820]   It's the entirety of the picture.
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:29.520]   Productivity, just feeling good throughout the day.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:32.600]   Socially also, like interacting with people
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.120]   because so much of human connection,
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.720]   like I mentioned before, is over food.
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:40.000]   And if you're gonna limit yourself in that regard,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.100]   you're limiting a certain fundamental aspect of life.
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:45.360]   - A number of years ago,
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:49.840]   I did like 20 to 22 hour fasts every day.
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:51.200]   And I'm like, well, this doesn't work.
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.280]   I can't do business lunches and stuff like that.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:54.480]   So, when I was in my fasting thing,
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.840]   I went to a 16 so I could have a light lunch
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:58.760]   just for the social aspect of it
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.080]   and to perform that.
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.680]   - That's funny.
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.440]   - And then that's why the typical bodybuilding,
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:06.920]   like the eight meal a day diet,
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.920]   has never worked for me because I've always been
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.640]   a very bit, like trying to fit that
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:12.800]   between meetings and other stuff.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.880]   What that diet provides is that just,
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:18.120]   you get less bloat and distention of a larger meal.
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:20.680]   But at the end of the day, you get the same exact results.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:23.040]   Pick a lifestyle, live that.
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:26.080]   You can have really great tasting food.
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:28.080]   And that, to me, is the same.
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:30.160]   And this is why I'm really hitting this point
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:33.120]   because also with the dieting and the approach,
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:34.520]   like, oh, I'm gonna do this.
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:38.360]   And people pick these chicken and broccoli recipes
[01:59:38.360 --> 01:59:39.320]   and guess what?
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.680]   You're going to break.
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:45.560]   If you do not enjoy it, you will break.
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:50.400]   So, it is a very important point.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:55.400]   - Well, I also slightly push back or maybe to elaborate,
[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:59.280]   if you don't enjoy moderation,
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:02.680]   for me particularly, I have trouble moderating
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:05.720]   certain things, most foods, I would say.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:09.400]   So, my source of happiness comes with foods,
[02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:12.360]   even if they're bland, the ones I can enjoy,
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.120]   but enjoy moderation.
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:16.160]   So, there's, I mean, I enjoy every piece of food.
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:21.160]   So, it's like, if you can enjoy the full lifestyle,
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:23.680]   it's not just the particular experience,
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:25.640]   but like the full journey.
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:27.640]   - Yep, does it fit your lifestyle?
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:28.480]   - Yeah. - Yep.
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.280]   So, let me ask about a complicated topic
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.160]   that's sometimes a bit controversial, which is steroids.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:41.880]   It may be TRT, testosterone replacement therapy.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.680]   What role does that play in strength training?
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:46.920]   - All right, we're gonna go there.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.120]   - Let's go there.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:52.600]   - Yeah, but it's an important discussion to have.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:55.320]   I think that it's something that I can be
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:57.880]   more transparent on.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.600]   In my past, I wasn't able to, due to the career that I had.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.600]   So, just like covering that stuff in a public forum,
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:11.520]   when you're highly looked at being an executive
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:13.680]   for recruiting and other stuff, like,
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:17.840]   it was an area I had to just kind of pass on, right?
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:18.680]   - Yes.
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:21.680]   - Now, I've used steroids.
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:23.600]   I've used them since I was 33.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:29.680]   And I basically just use TRT now, after my big squat.
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:33.480]   So, for 10 years, I used them.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:37.960]   And there's some interesting components to this.
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:41.880]   So, one is just the gray area
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:44.480]   of what we call performance enhancing supplements.
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:47.720]   So, performance, was it PEDs?
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:54.440]   That the line of what defines a PED is ever shifting
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.120]   and it's shifting based on society norms,
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.400]   cultural norms, government bodying agencies,
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:01.520]   all these sorts of stuff.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:03.000]   So, I'm not making excuses here.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.280]   So, I just wanna elaborate before I actually start
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.360]   digging into the details here.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:09.760]   Because performance enhancing,
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:11.920]   I could take sodium bicarbonate
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:17.040]   and enhance my ability to perform deadlifts for reps.
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:17.880]   Guess what?
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:19.040]   I did that for my Guinness World Record
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:20.960]   for deadlifts in a minute, okay?
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:22.840]   People do it for rowing or other,
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.880]   they use high capacity type stuff.
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:28.520]   It is performance enhancing.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.700]   It is a chemical.
[02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:31.760]   It is baking soda.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:34.040]   All right?
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.320]   They're not able to make it illegal
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:39.240]   because everybody eats bread.
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:40.240]   Well, not everyone.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:42.880]   And so, it's a little hard to test for,
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:45.160]   no matter what you do at any level.
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:47.000]   So, that's an extreme example.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.440]   But other examples, you were drinking an energy drink
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:52.800]   in that cup there a little while ago.
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:55.080]   And in America, you can get an energy drink
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.800]   with 240 milligrams of caffeine in it.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:59.980]   In Canada, that's too dangerous.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:02.040]   You can only get 140.
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:03.520]   But you can go buy Ephedra.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:07.040]   And Ephedra is illegal in America.
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:10.380]   And so, these things bounce back and forth all the time.
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:12.560]   I could take Yohimbi.
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.560]   And in Europe or Australia,
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:17.840]   it is a drug and classified.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.960]   In America, it is not.
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.400]   It's an herbal root.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.660]   And a lot, I actually haven't one of my supplements,
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:27.880]   except for the overseas version.
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:29.800]   Anyway, the point I'm getting is,
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.900]   no matter what you do at some point,
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:35.760]   by someone's standards, you are cheating.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:41.920]   And because it is, you're taking something that,
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:44.340]   but you could work around these things
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:46.540]   with nutritional ways or other ways
[02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:47.880]   versus taking a chemical.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:49.580]   And there's whole lots of ways to do this.
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:51.080]   But it's like, oh no, it's steroids.
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:51.920]   It's not.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:52.740]   It's injectable.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:53.580]   It's not.
[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:55.960]   Well, somewhere, there's a culture or a person
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:57.720]   that will say you're cheating, no matter what.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:59.520]   So, it's a self-defined,
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.800]   you need to define it for yourself
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.000]   unless you're competing in an organization
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.180]   that has testing.
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:06.760]   Then it's a straight ethical thing.
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:09.640]   And it's either right or wrong, in my opinion.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:13.180]   That's kind of the overall dilemma of it is,
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:17.120]   if you want to see what you're totally capable of,
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:21.800]   you have to decide yourself what's okay or not
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:23.160]   to that level.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:28.160]   There is no body that can say something yes or no.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:31.580]   - Yeah, when there's an event like the Olympics,
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:33.900]   maybe then you have a standard
[02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:35.980]   that you're all trying to adhere to.
[02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:38.260]   And then it makes sense to keep a certain,
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:41.300]   like to be within, there's an ethical imperative.
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:43.500]   - So, yeah, I'm not talking about that.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:46.900]   I'm agreeing to compete in this by these rules.
[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:49.700]   - Yeah, but when you're trying to maximize
[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:51.800]   your own performance, whatever that journey is,
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:54.080]   whatever that goal is, that's a different story.
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:56.740]   And it's not easy to figure that out.
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:04:59.780]   - You go, you're just like dancing around the subject,
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:00.640]   whatever.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:02.340]   Well, guess what?
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:05.920]   I've got a prescription for growth hormone and testosterone.
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:07.700]   It's legal for me to take.
[02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:09.100]   And you know what?
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:10.980]   A lot of the people that are in front of the camera
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:14.820]   in the media, politicians and news people,
[02:05:14.820 --> 02:05:18.660]   and the people that are there saying the no drug stuff,
[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:21.700]   they're going to anti-aging clinics to look better.
[02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:23.820]   And they have a prescription for growth hormone
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.800]   and testosterone themselves.
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:28.820]   But in their eyes, it's okay.
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:30.580]   It is a prescription from their doctor
[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:33.140]   because they have the money to do it.
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:37.700]   So it's legal and it's fine.
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:40.940]   If I, it's interesting in Oregon,
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:43.820]   anybody, and I don't know what other states,
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:47.700]   over the age of 16, can, without parents' permission,
[02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:50.220]   by the way, walk into a gender clinic,
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:53.220]   and as a female, and get a prescription for testosterone.
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:59.040]   But as an athlete, if I've got low testosterone,
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.940]   I am so low, I've got depression,
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:03.940]   I can't have sex with my wife,
[02:06:03.940 --> 02:06:05.980]   it's affecting my quality of life,
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:08.220]   I will have to fight tooth and nail
[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:10.940]   to get testosterone just as a prescription.
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:12.860]   And then I will get kicked out of my organization
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:13.700]   for competing.
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:18.380]   So you understand how gray this stuff gets?
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:21.260]   - Do you think the stigma on testosterone
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:24.500]   is the reason we're not having a healthy conversation
[02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:26.300]   about when it's proper?
[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:28.580]   Like, what are the proper uses of testosterone
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:32.140]   in an athlete's life and just the regular human life?
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.700]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:35.700]   I mean, and it's just, it's like anything.
[02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:38.900]   It's like I said, it is lines that we pick and draw.
[02:06:38.900 --> 02:06:40.660]   Anytime you put that out there,
[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:42.180]   people are going to have different opinions
[02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:43.180]   where those lines are.
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:44.980]   So now when it comes to strength,
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:46.100]   here's an interesting thing.
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:48.820]   In powerlifting, there's tested federations
[02:06:48.820 --> 02:06:50.040]   and non-tested federations.
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.460]   So we can literally look at the statistical data
[02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:56.400]   and actually find out what do steroids do?
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:58.980]   And so it's pretty clear that steroids provide
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:03.980]   at about a 10% increase in strength on average over not.
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:06.740]   Now, that does take out the fact that steroids
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:09.460]   will put you in, allow you to put on more mass
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:12.900]   so you'll go up a weight class a lot of times.
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:16.180]   So as a whole, you could definitely lift more probably
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:19.460]   than the 10% over time, right?
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:21.340]   And then we think about steroids as the ability
[02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:23.140]   to just put on muscle.
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:25.580]   And here's where things get a little interesting,
[02:07:25.580 --> 02:07:27.180]   even with people that use steroids,
[02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:29.700]   is not understanding the neurological impacts
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:31.340]   that steroids have.
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:34.400]   'Cause you could take some steroids right now
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:36.800]   and be stronger in 10 minutes.
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.360]   That's clearly not done anything, you know,
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:42.000]   from a physiology standpoint to make you stronger,
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.880]   but we have tapped in neurologically to elicit those gains.
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:49.400]   And there's a whole lot that happens neurologically.
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:53.520]   - Like how much science is there
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:56.200]   in terms of all the different ways you could take steroids,
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:08:00.240]   which kinds of steroids, the timing, the dose,
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.060]   all of those things to develop the neurological,
[02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:05.640]   the physical, the skeletal, like all the,
[02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:07.840]   you know, you've talked with such depth
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:12.840]   about the science of strength building in terms of form,
[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:16.280]   in terms of the equipment that you use.
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:19.800]   It seems like a component, you know,
[02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:23.680]   the use of steroids should be an equal level
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:25.720]   of scientific rigor when applying them.
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:26.560]   - It is.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:31.560]   Now, the research is harder to get because of what it is,
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:34.840]   but there is a lot of research that was done
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.280]   when they were legal.
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.080]   So they were legal up in through the,
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:39.920]   through I think the mid 80s.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:44.920]   And so a lot of the classical high benefit
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:48.560]   to low risk steroids were studied.
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:51.400]   And then since then, there's a lot of like designer steroids
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:52.900]   or new steroids that have come up
[02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:57.520]   that don't have a lot of research around safety and risk
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.440]   and things of that nature.
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.960]   And we can't do that because it's, you know,
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:04.280]   because of the legality around these things.
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:06.520]   But some of the stuff on the neurological function
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:10.920]   is really just understanding how that chemical structure
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:14.680]   works and what it's doing to the neurotransmitters,
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:15.660]   what it's doing.
[02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:20.960]   And so some of it is really talking to people
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.440]   that have experience with it.
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.760]   And the other is understanding those structures
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:26.960]   and what they do.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.840]   The neurological component, I think,
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.160]   is more interesting than most
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:35.000]   because the most steroids act through
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.960]   increasing muscle protein synthesis.
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:38.600]   That's how you add more muscle
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:41.700]   is they have an anti-catabolic effect
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:45.360]   and they have a muscle protein synthesis enhancing effect.
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:48.080]   So it reduces the amount of muscle that you waste
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:51.280]   and increases the amount of muscle that you put on.
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:56.280]   But the neurological component is tremendously valuable
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:00.600]   for what it can do for your training workout.
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:02.800]   Like if I handle more load over time,
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:04.660]   I'm going to make more progress.
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:07.380]   If I can actually just stimulate more neurological effects
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:11.640]   for a specific event, it's gonna have an impact, right?
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:14.340]   But there's other ways that you can tap into this too.
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:16.960]   Things that you can tap into mentally with great practice,
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.480]   with meditation and other stuff
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:21.480]   that will have the same effect.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.960]   People probably think I'm over speaking,
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:25.640]   especially steroid users that are listening to this.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:29.200]   Well, at least I'm talking out my ass, but I'm not.
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:34.200]   Because I have experience with this stuff on both ends.
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:35.700]   And some of those areas,
[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:39.240]   a lot of people don't have the experience with that.
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.720]   - What I've kind of heard from people
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:44.760]   is the confidence that comes with steroids.
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:47.980]   It feels like, not to call it placebo,
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:50.280]   but it seems like the psychological benefits
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:51.680]   of steroids is huge.
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:55.760]   And that you feel like there's a confidence
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:59.160]   that seems to be coupled with the actual biological.
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:00.520]   - And chemical effects.
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.280]   - I have actually a neurological condition.
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.960]   So I actually don't feel a lot of that stuff that people,
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:08.640]   'cause there's certain steroids that people will like,
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:12.220]   your very extreme ones,
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:15.200]   that would make somebody bite someone's ear off
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.560]   in a fight, for example.
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:19.760]   - Almost like aggression.
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:21.180]   - And they literally do nothing.
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:22.960]   I'm always just chilling.
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.760]   I don't have an effect. - That's great.
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:29.960]   - But neurologically, they're still having those effects,
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:31.200]   but I don't get those feels
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:34.240]   that other people have from those.
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.440]   But yes, there's that immediate boost in aggression
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:39.920]   and the confidence and stuff that come with
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:42.840]   a lot of those ones that deal on the neurological.
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:44.640]   Overall, a good sense of well-being,
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:46.640]   just like from being on testosterone.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:48.840]   It's gonna affect your mood.
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:49.960]   And it's interesting.
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:52.320]   So testosterone replacement therapy,
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:55.080]   if we walk down that path now and kind of switch gears,
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:00.280]   we find that men today have declining testosterone
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:02.880]   over what has historically been in the past.
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:07.020]   So right now, I think a 35-year-old testosterone
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:12.020]   is shown to be about half what it was just 50 years ago.
[02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:15.600]   So I don't know if we could argue the point.
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:18.060]   We don't really have the science to validate any of it,
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:22.200]   but it could be society as far as the impact
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:26.200]   that it's having on the mental health.
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.200]   For men, it could be the estrogens floating around
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:32.400]   in the water from all the chemicals and birth control
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:33.400]   and all this sort of stuff.
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:34.680]   Could be a lot of things.
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:39.120]   But it is a fact that average testosterone
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:40.560]   is significantly lower,
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:43.640]   and that is going to end up affecting life,
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:46.220]   quality of life, as well as your longevity,
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:47.600]   because it will affect those things.
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:50.480]   But on the other end, steroids and TRT,
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:52.240]   particularly steroids, come with a lot
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:54.200]   of negative health benefits.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:57.680]   Not benefits, a lot of negative health ramifications.
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:01.140]   And so if I knew what I know now,
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:02.780]   I don't know that I would have gone that path.
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:04.520]   I didn't, I didn't until I was 33,
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:07.600]   which is kind of an outlier for a strength athlete.
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:10.600]   I was a four times body weight deadlifter,
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:15.600]   800 plus pounds at 198, and I was pretty dang strong
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:18.560]   before I went down that path.
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:21.000]   And that's 'cause I wanted to see what I was capable of,
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.480]   but I was reaching a point that it was either
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:24.560]   I need to do that or not.
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:27.120]   My testosterone, my natural testosterone levels
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:31.200]   were actually, I think below 300 is actually the threshold.
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:34.920]   So I was being told to go on TRT for the last couple years,
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:36.480]   probably just 'cause I was pushing so hard
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:38.480]   and the stress level was driving my test down.
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:41.320]   So it was self-imposed, more than likely.
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:43.420]   But I put it off because I wanted to set
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:44.940]   all the drug-free records.
[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:47.560]   And I set the ones that I wanted, and then it was 33.
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:49.760]   I'm entering the age category,
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:52.200]   and I'm like, I'm gonna go on TRT.
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.160]   I did not feel like I should be with TRT.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.040]   Personally, my ethical standard was
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:59.580]   I shouldn't be competing in tested events anymore.
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:02.840]   There are federations that will allow you with your,
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:04.960]   you show up with your script and you do your test
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:07.960]   and you're below a certain level, but you're still on.
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:09.440]   But for me, I'm like, that's not okay.
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:10.280]   - You weren't comfortable.
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:13.000]   - So I'm like, I may as well at this point use steroids.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:18.340]   But since then, understanding all those ramifications,
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:20.960]   I might not have gone down that route
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:23.080]   quite so fast and easily.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:27.920]   But I continued because I also have a lot of resources
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:30.280]   that other people don't, and being able to assess
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:32.760]   and understand and put things in place to mitigate that.
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:34.680]   So you need to be, and the other thing is,
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:37.760]   once you go on, it's literally a decision for life.
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:44.400]   But realistically is, because your quality of life,
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:47.400]   your feeling is going to be enhanced quite a bit,
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.080]   and you're not gonna wanna go back.
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.680]   And if you go back, it's going to be less
[02:14:50.680 --> 02:14:51.780]   than it was before.
[02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:54.840]   That's how the endocrine system works.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:56.740]   There are ways to try to recover and bring that up,
[02:14:56.740 --> 02:14:58.440]   but it might be a while.
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:14:59.640]   And if you've been on for a while,
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:01.880]   it definitely is not an option.
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:04.920]   So those are big things that people need to understand
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:07.360]   that you're going to have some things in there.
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:10.800]   And even TRT has some potential,
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:12.900]   especially at higher levels,
[02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:17.900]   that it's going to increase the risk for prostate cancer.
[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:22.260]   It's going to potentially cause some hypertrophy
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:23.740]   of the left ventricle of the heart
[02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:25.540]   and some potential plaque buildup
[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:27.300]   of some of those key arteries around there
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:28.500]   that's going to have an impact
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:30.640]   on your cardiovascular health.
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:32.560]   There's things that you can do, again,
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:35.060]   but everything is like the shoe story, right?
[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:37.700]   Where I'm anti-shoe, but I'm going,
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:39.500]   well, we could put Band-Aids on this.
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:40.340]   - Yeah.
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:41.180]   - So it's--
[02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:44.060]   - So there's a quality of life that comes with it,
[02:15:44.060 --> 02:15:45.660]   the increase in quality of life.
[02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:48.420]   And if you do it correctly, I think--
[02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:50.500]   - For me, I definitely would not live without TRT,
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:53.260]   even with knowing what I know now.
[02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:55.740]   This age and the quality of life
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:16:00.700]   and being able to be there, have the energy, the recovery.
[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:01.940]   That's a big thing where all this, though,
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:04.420]   I talked about muscle protein synthesis
[02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:07.420]   and anti-catabolism as being big drivers,
[02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:12.040]   but recovery is the other big aspect that they offer,
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:13.380]   probably as a result of those,
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:17.220]   but those are going to be the big enhancements.
[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:20.140]   So just doing steroids,
[02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:22.220]   steroids is going to increase
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:23.740]   all the other stuff that you do.
[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:26.500]   So if you have good training, you have good diet,
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:28.580]   good quality of sleep, like all this other stuff,
[02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:31.180]   then you can take advantage of that.
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:33.780]   But you could choose steroids and nobody would know.
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:37.100]   And honestly, you go down to 24-hour fitness
[02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:41.420]   and you'll see a bunch of late 19 to 21-year-old kids
[02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:43.800]   that are all kind of red and 150 pounds
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:46.320]   that don't look like anything,
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:49.380]   and a bunch of them will be using steroids
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:52.280]   because they're not,
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:55.420]   like, so it's not going to make a champion.
[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:58.060]   - Like you said, 10% at most.
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:16:58.900]   - Guess what?
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:16:59.940]   I was already at an elite level.
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:03.280]   I was one of the best in the world before I started using.
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:05.880]   It doesn't do that.
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:08.760]   It does a 10% increase at best.
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:10.760]   And that's proven in the statistics, which is interesting
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:13.320]   'cause most people don't know this.
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:15.000]   The data is right there.
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:20.220]   - Yeah, and that's why I'm often saddened
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:25.220]   by maybe the negative view of somebody like Lance Armstrong,
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:31.360]   who was one of the greatest athletes in history.
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.400]   - And everybody else that he was competing against.
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.720]   I'm sorry.
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:36.680]   I hate to blow anybody's bubble,
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.880]   but regardless of I told you my ethical pieces
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:41.480]   with saying that you're going to be at something
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:42.520]   at an elite level,
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:47.840]   you look at a lot of those big figures out there,
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:51.840]   when their income and your life relies on it,
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:53.000]   you're going to push those limits.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.580]   So maybe my ethical would change
[02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:57.640]   if I was in that position too,
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:59.960]   because here's the thing where I believe,
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:01.760]   like someone is,
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:04.760]   I think people should avoid steroids.
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:09.120]   TRT, probably something worth taking a look
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:12.000]   at what your levels are when you're in the 35 to 45 range
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.080]   and see what decision you decide to make from there.
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:15.240]   And that's a decision that you make
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:16.540]   for the rest of your life.
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:19.000]   The only times that you should be taking a look at steroids
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.920]   is if it's funding your life,
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:25.340]   it's creating that it is your job and it's doing like,
[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:27.080]   and honestly, it was for me.
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:30.800]   So was it the only thing?
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:31.640]   No.
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:32.720]   - No.
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:35.040]   - If you want to get into neurology,
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:37.040]   neurotransmitters and alcohol,
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:38.400]   there's really interesting discussion
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.880]   on performance enhancement.
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:41.300]   So when I lift heavy,
[02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:45.160]   and so I always promote it like not more than a drink or two
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.240]   like once or twice a month is what all I'm talking about
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:48.840]   when I'm saying this.
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:51.320]   - What's the timing of the drink that we're talking about?
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:52.760]   - It's about three to five minutes.
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:53.600]   - Before?
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:54.420]   - Yes.
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:56.320]   - And we're talking about beer?
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:58.600]   - It doesn't matter the source.
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:01.600]   So shots are the easiest.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:03.080]   You want something that is not going to have
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:06.240]   some sort of regurgitory effect or bloating effect
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:07.800]   or anything like that.
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:09.520]   But you want to have the quick hit of energy.
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:11.280]   So it's a preferential energy source,
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:14.440]   moves above ketones, carbs, everything.
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:15.840]   It's seven calories per gram,
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:17.960]   but then there's some really interesting things
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:18.800]   that happen.
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:19.680]   Spikes blood pressure,
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:21.600]   which is going to make weights feel lighter.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:23.400]   So when you're in your early 20s
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:26.720]   and you're trying to hit up some attractive person
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:29.160]   at the bar, you're with your buddies,
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:30.360]   and you're like, ah, you know,
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:32.360]   and you got second guess, oh, should I, should I?
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:35.760]   And they go, have a shot of liquid courage.
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:36.820]   And you have one.
[02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:39.680]   And all of a sudden the second thoughts,
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:41.480]   the second guessing, all that drops away.
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:44.680]   Like you're focused in the moment and you walk over
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.640]   and you actually perform a little better
[02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:48.160]   like conversation-wise than you normally would.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:50.160]   Now, if you have five or six and then go over,
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:51.000]   you're gonna make a fool of yourself.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.640]   So it's all about timing and amount,
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.480]   but there is a reason that that happens.
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.380]   So anyway, I'm known for promoting
[02:19:56.380 --> 02:19:58.400]   this whiskey and deadlift concept.
[02:19:58.400 --> 02:19:59.240]   - I love this.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:00.060]   - But it works.
[02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:01.760]   - You're talking like the Eastern block.
[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:03.720]   - That's where I stole it from
[02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:06.320]   'cause I was watching all these Russian lifters
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:08.520]   would have a shot of vodka or something
[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:09.380]   before they go lift.
[02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:11.200]   And I'm like, there's something here.
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:14.840]   So I started experimenting with it and I'm like, that works.
[02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:15.880]   And then I started researching.
[02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:17.120]   Nobody talks about this stuff.
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:19.400]   So it takes a while to start piecing together
[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:22.320]   all the stuff that actually happens to make that happen.
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:26.120]   But it moves away the things that you're going to,
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:28.920]   the concerns about the ramifications in the future
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:29.760]   and the other stuff.
[02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:32.720]   So the, but brings you into the moment
[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:34.840]   and then the dopamine hit in the other,
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:37.640]   and then it enhances whatever mood that you're in.
[02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:42.640]   But all of a sudden you get in the state much easier.
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:46.640]   And so it's really, really interesting,
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:49.660]   but it's a very small amount needed
[02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:51.240]   and very time sensitive,
[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:53.880]   but it can be so much more powerful
[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:57.000]   than like drugs people use for this stuff.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.160]   It ties really together with meditative state
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:02.920]   and other pieces to get you into that flow state.
[02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:06.120]   Those thoughts about failure, what if, what,
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:10.960]   like all that you get into that zone, that moment, that time.
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:15.080]   Anyway, so interesting an alcoholic is promoting,
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:16.480]   out, you know, but-
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:18.120]   - No, but there's an important point here,
[02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:19.540]   which not often talked about.
[02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:22.600]   I think it is fascinating that because you can get
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:25.960]   into so much trouble with alcohol when using excess,
[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:29.280]   people don't often talk about the positive aspects
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:32.740]   of alcohol, even in your college years.
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:37.320]   - It had a lasting effect on who I am as a person.
[02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:39.480]   - I don't think people give enough credit
[02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:41.160]   to the positive aspect.
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:43.080]   See, you could have accomplished a lot
[02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:45.280]   of those same things with a little more moderation,
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:47.860]   which I think people should talk about more,
[02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:51.320]   which is like the way to open up a personality,
[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:54.680]   like the flowering of the full character and the weirdness
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:58.440]   and the beauty of who you are as a human being
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:00.080]   could be opened up with alcohol,
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:01.880]   and that's really interesting to think about.
[02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:06.000]   - You should try some podcasts with a shot in these.
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:06.840]   - Yeah.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:10.000]   - You know, actually, I do this sometimes
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000]   with myself and guests, and it will change the conversation,
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.120]   lubricates the conversation, definitely not the excess,
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:19.800]   and which is what I learned, 'cause I went all the way in
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:22.120]   because I do everything at extremes.
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:24.920]   So it was a really hard lesson that took me a lot of time
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:28.960]   to unwind, but it is interesting,
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:30.760]   and people don't discuss those things,
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:33.040]   'cause it's either this or this.
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:36.900]   - You're one of the greatest strength athletes of all time,
[02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:41.280]   so it's worthwhile to consider how you optimize
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:44.480]   the feats of strength that you reach for
[02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:47.280]   with things like steroids.
[02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:50.480]   It makes perfect sense, and I think that was,
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.160]   from my perspective, I think it was probably
[02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:53.040]   the right decision.
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:54.520]   You've achieved something incredible
[02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:57.500]   that inspires a huge number of people.
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:23:01.680]   That's it, and you've shown to yourself and to the world
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:03.600]   what the human body can accomplish.
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:04.600]   - Yep. - That's incredible.
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:08.000]   - And no matter if I push to a less weight
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.300]   and if I disclosed everything that I did,
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:13.800]   and I wasn't using steroids, in my opinion,
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:15.920]   if we went through everything, there were people
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:18.000]   that would say, "You're using performance enhancing."
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:18.840]   - Yeah. - No matter what.
[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:21.080]   Like, it is straight up, so you just need
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:23.480]   to be okay with it yourself, and so I had to make the call.
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:27.800]   I wanna see what the true potential is of,
[02:23:27.800 --> 02:23:30.480]   let's throw everything out the window,
[02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:33.440]   unless I feel it's a risk from a health standpoint
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:35.040]   that I'm not willing to take on,
[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:39.160]   because that's, how do I, like,
[02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:40.320]   it's just picking and choosing.
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:41.600]   - Yeah. - It's just picking
[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:42.520]   and choosing.
[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:43.800]   Here's what I want to know.
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:46.240]   This is what I want to be able to try to achieve,
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:48.360]   and so yeah, yeah, that's what I did.
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:50.600]   - And what you did is incredible.
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:52.280]   Like, it's just awe-inspiring.
[02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:54.400]   - And what Lance Armstrong did was incredible.
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:57.000]   - Yeah, and-- - And that eats me up,
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.600]   and what's funny is the people that bash him
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:01.840]   are on the media or politicians or maybe some actors,
[02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:03.360]   and guess what?
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:06.400]   A ton of them are doing the same thing.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:08.520]   It's hypocrisy at its finest, trust me.
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:10.720]   - But-- - How many of those figures
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:12.920]   you're watching in movies that love to talk,
[02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:17.440]   be political and do this and the news and all this,
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:20.960]   I'm telling you, there's anti-aging clinics
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.960]   like all over California and everywhere else.
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:28.520]   Who do you think keeps them in business?
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:29.960]   - Well-- - It's not a competitive lifter,
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:31.280]   I'll tell you that.
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:33.440]   - Well, that's-- - And they're using peptides
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:37.560]   and SARMs and all sorts of like--
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.520]   - Wait, you're speaking to the hypocrisy.
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:42.160]   I also want to speak to the fact, you know,
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:44.080]   somebody who's a friend of mine, David Goggins,
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:45.160]   I don't know if you know who that is,
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:48.440]   ultra marathon runner, Navy SEAL.
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:49.640]   He gets-- - Pretty incredible person,
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:50.880]   yeah. - Incredible human being
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:53.560]   and he gets criticism like, you know,
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:56.760]   what you're doing is bad for the body,
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:59.140]   you know, you're pushing yourself too far.
[02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:04.520]   I find that the people that criticize are often people
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:08.440]   that haven't truly pushed themselves to the limit.
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:11.040]   They haven't actually worked hard in their life.
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:15.760]   When you work hard, you realize how incredible it is
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:18.360]   that a human being can dedicate themselves
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:21.960]   so fully to an effort, the way you did,
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:24.560]   the way David Goggins does,
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:27.400]   the way the greatest athletes do.
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:30.440]   And there's nothing that should be said
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:32.540]   beyond just sitting back in awe
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:33.840]   that humans can achieve that.
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:36.520]   And that inspires me to do the best,
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:40.040]   whatever the hell I do, to be the best version of that.
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:42.760]   There's something about like athletic feats,
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:44.960]   especially like strength,
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:49.060]   that just inspire us to do the best,
[02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:51.500]   to be the best version of ourselves.
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:54.340]   I don't know, that's the only thing you should be saying
[02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:59.280]   as opposed to criticizing some little detail of this
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:03.520]   and that, it's just awe-inspiring that you push yourself.
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:05.420]   - And then talk to anybody that is at that level,
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:07.300]   and this is funny, like in competitive sports,
[02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:09.740]   like you go online and people, it's just bash, bash, bash,
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:10.780]   bash, bash, bash, bash, bash.
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:14.420]   You go talk to anybody, anybody, anybody
[02:26:14.420 --> 02:26:16.820]   that's a high-level athlete within that field,
[02:26:16.820 --> 02:26:19.960]   and nobody has a single bad thing to say about each other.
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:22.780]   But all this chitter-chatter down there,
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:25.300]   I mean, I know exactly what you're saying.
[02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:27.580]   - So if you, I would say,
[02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:29.980]   'cause I have love for all those folks,
[02:26:29.980 --> 02:26:31.020]   especially when you're younger,
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:36.020]   you have a little bit of that desire to criticize others.
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:38.020]   Like, I think that should be channeled
[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:39.940]   in improving your own life.
[02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:42.420]   - Anytime that you feel that way,
[02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:44.780]   that is when you need to turn inward.
[02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:48.220]   And it's hard to do, but there is a reason
[02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:52.660]   that you have those emotions around someone else
[02:26:52.660 --> 02:26:54.140]   and what they're doing,
[02:26:54.140 --> 02:26:57.260]   that you have an opportunity to look at yourself
[02:26:57.260 --> 02:27:00.620]   and know why you feel that way.
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:02.860]   And that, guess what, that's gonna be the hard thing to do.
[02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:03.920]   That's gonna be the thing, again,
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:05.600]   that's stirring you a little bit,
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:08.420]   'cause it's so much easier to sit there
[02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:11.060]   and, or talk to your confidant or whatever
[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:14.540]   instead of go, why does that bother me?
[02:27:14.540 --> 02:27:16.340]   Why does what that person doing
[02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:20.480]   or what that person's achieving bother me?
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:25.500]   - It's a good difficult question that I often ask others,
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:31.260]   whether it's better to work hard or work smart.
[02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:33.100]   I like to ask that question
[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:36.860]   because it helps me get a sense of the human being.
[02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:40.060]   And I think I, let me just say,
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:45.060]   like I often like people that answer that with work hard.
[02:27:45.060 --> 02:27:53.500]   Even though the quote unquote right answer is work smart,
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:57.900]   meaning like finding the optimal, efficient way
[02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:00.180]   to achieve a certain goal,
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:03.340]   I find that people that answer work smart
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:06.280]   don't actually find the optimal,
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:08.540]   efficient way to achieve a goal.
[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:10.540]   It seems like the people that at least,
[02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:14.740]   certainly early in life, strive to work their ass off,
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:18.740]   even that means doing the inefficient, the dumb thing,
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:20.940]   just to learn the mistake.
[02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:24.260]   The spirit behind, the human spirit behind the person
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:28.340]   that says work hard is the one that I connect with.
[02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:30.900]   But I'm torn, especially in the work culture
[02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:33.340]   and the tech sector where people answer work smart.
[02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:37.980]   What would you, what would you say about that tension?
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:40.180]   This definitely encompasses like,
[02:28:40.180 --> 02:28:44.180]   I'm the intellectual and I'm the meathead.
[02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:49.180]   I'm the work around the clock and go fix the processes
[02:28:49.180 --> 02:28:52.340]   and make it so much better type person, right?
[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:54.500]   That's me and that's everything,
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:56.500]   that's my life story, right?
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:59.580]   Busting your ass to find the easiest way possible.
[02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:00.860]   To both.
[02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:05.860]   So like I will build a custom hard drive
[02:29:06.700 --> 02:29:10.500]   or a custom hydraulic cart that will lift my plates
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:15.340]   up to the height of my squat so that I can minimize,
[02:29:15.340 --> 02:29:17.780]   I roll it over next to it and then minimize the effort
[02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:19.940]   of it going on and off.
[02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:22.980]   To be able to lift the most amount of weight as possible.
[02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:27.740]   So that I can save the energy from here,
[02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:29.740]   from lifting those up and the fatigue of my back
[02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:33.720]   being in a bad position so I can nearly kill myself
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:35.560]   over here, right?
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:41.440]   I, my wife, anybody will say, I'm a workaholic.
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:43.840]   And the first thing that I would do
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:47.480]   when it would be doing a company turnaround,
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.160]   they'd hire me, come in and I would be taking over
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:52.200]   for someone that wasn't successful.
[02:29:52.200 --> 02:29:55.560]   But it was usually hardly ever for lack of want or trying.
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:57.600]   So a lot of times they knew they were unsuccessful
[02:29:57.600 --> 02:30:00.920]   and they were running around working six, seven days a week,
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:04.000]   12 hour days doing so much.
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.280]   And it'd be like, well, you need to do this
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:07.960]   and they'd train me on like all the reports and this
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:10.160]   and all the things and like, good luck.
[02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:12.720]   Good luck, I couldn't do it.
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:15.300]   And the first thing I would do is nothing.
[02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:19.200]   I would do nothing.
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:26.360]   Because then I would find what actually keeps coming back.
[02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:29.720]   The things that I need to do and how much of it
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:31.560]   was filling the space.
[02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:35.880]   Because so much of human nature when you're failing
[02:30:35.880 --> 02:30:38.880]   is to make yourself feel like you're accomplishing things.
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:42.320]   This is when things go on your list, on your checklist
[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:44.040]   and you start like rolling up.
[02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:47.440]   So you're running around just getting shit done.
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:48.720]   - Yeah, yeah, being busy.
[02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:49.560]   - Right?
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:54.560]   And so, but at the same time, like find somewhere
[02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:57.240]   in my career, something I've done
[02:30:57.240 --> 02:30:59.160]   where I haven't outworked everybody.
[02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:03.320]   Just so much on distilling things down to what's important.
[02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:04.160]   - Yeah.
[02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:09.160]   - And you've got to make time to sit back and assess
[02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:14.320]   and think and be introspective.
[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:16.960]   You have to make time for this.
[02:31:16.960 --> 02:31:20.160]   'Cause if not, you're gonna waste so much time
[02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:25.160]   sitting there walking sideways when all you gotta do
[02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:28.760]   is move just one step in front of the other each day.
[02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:30.760]   Just one, that's all I say.
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:34.680]   Because it's gonna add up.
[02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:38.160]   But you could spend six months knocking shit out,
[02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:40.360]   doing your routine, busting your ass
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:43.180]   and not take that one step.
[02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:46.920]   So you've gotta distill stuff down.
[02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:49.800]   You've gotta really understand like what's important
[02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:51.080]   to you in life and where you're going.
[02:31:51.080 --> 02:31:54.860]   And when you're looking at anything in your life,
[02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:57.360]   the first thing that you need to do is figure out
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:01.280]   do I need to do it and just quit doing it.
[02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:03.500]   Just quit doing things in your life.
[02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:06.800]   And you'll see that a lot of stuff
[02:32:06.800 --> 02:32:10.520]   that you think has to be done doesn't have to be done.
[02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:12.640]   You'd be surprised.
[02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:16.280]   And then from there, it's the tech, okay.
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:19.480]   And then of that, what can I automate?
[02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:23.200]   What can I not have to do in a repeated fashion?
[02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:26.020]   And then the last one, yeah, wherever possible.
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:29.640]   If it's not something that I'm adding tremendous value to,
[02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:31.320]   like my uniqueness, people are like,
[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:33.440]   oh, you must do the auto work on your vehicles
[02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:34.260]   'cause you love working.
[02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:36.160]   I'm like, fuck that, I don't.
[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:37.800]   They're like, what, that doesn't make any sense.
[02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:40.280]   And I'm like, no, I love creating things.
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:43.500]   But I don't wanna do that stuff.
[02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:47.000]   So you could use delegating if you're a manager position,
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:51.460]   but it's outsourcing, whatever it is.
[02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:53.240]   But there are also so many things.
[02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:58.240]   And this ties back to your point around just doing it.
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:01.300]   There's a point to experiencing all levels
[02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:03.040]   to really understand things.
[02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:06.660]   You need to spend time at the same time
[02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:07.580]   doing all those things
[02:33:07.580 --> 02:33:11.300]   'cause there could be good, huge, massive gaps in there
[02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:14.160]   that you're not aware of that are key for you
[02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:17.300]   or key to having done different or so on.
[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:20.700]   So like in my company days,
[02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:23.760]   I was one of the few executives that came in
[02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:25.860]   that could do anything on the floor
[02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:30.860]   from code to machine, run a lathe, a mill, weld,
[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:32.680]   step into engineering.
[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:37.260]   And that added tremendous value to me
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:41.120]   to having had spent time being a doer
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:43.400]   and not enough people want to be,
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:45.680]   you've gotta just go do shit.
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:47.880]   You need to spend time in your life chopping wood.
[02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:49.840]   Yeah, get a lot of shit done, doesn't matter what the shit is.
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:53.180]   You gotta have experience trying and doing
[02:33:53.180 --> 02:33:55.900]   all these things that you would never,
[02:33:55.900 --> 02:33:59.580]   my skillset is massive because I want to know,
[02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:01.840]   you need to have those touch points.
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:05.420]   My job, my title is chief visionary.
[02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:11.840]   But I've spent time doing everything.
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:15.520]   It's not about just creating this amazing strategy
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:17.120]   or vision and I'm just gonna be there
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:18.560]   and this person that directs.
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:22.840]   Like you can't be effective, you cannot connect the dots
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:27.360]   unless you've been in the moment with everything.
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:28.600]   Yeah, low level stuff.
[02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:30.760]   Sometimes it's doing stupid shit
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:34.040]   that you're not uniquely qualified to do
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:36.280]   that anybody could do, but you did it anyway.
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:38.120]   Just the training environment.
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:41.320]   People hit me up at a school or wherever like,
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:45.240]   hey, how do I get into, I wanna grow my brand online.
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:47.480]   I wanna do this, like where do I start?
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.400]   I'm like, go get a job at Planet Fitness
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:52.520]   or 24 Hour Fitness.
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:55.960]   They're like, but I wanna, how do I get recognized
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:57.800]   and write articles and be an online coach?
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:02.400]   I'm like, you need to go spend a few years
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:06.480]   one-on-one training people to learn the interaction,
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:09.620]   how people, there's base levels you have to do.
[02:35:09.620 --> 02:35:13.860]   You've gotta go work your way up from the ground.
[02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:15.400]   I truly believe it.
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:17.080]   - Well, I think that's the hard work piece
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:20.480]   that I'm speaking to that I like it
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:23.720]   when people have been humbled by the hardness of life.
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:27.000]   Like how difficult it is to do stuff.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:27.840]   And to be honest--
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:29.160]   - Like, oh, I went and got my MBA.
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:30.040]   I went to MIT.
[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:31.480]   I don't need to do that stuff.
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:32.560]   I'm above that.
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:33.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:36.560]   That's, once you've been humbled by doing those things,
[02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:41.560]   I feel like you can truly explore the optimization
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:43.020]   that you're talking to,
[02:35:43.020 --> 02:35:46.160]   finding the ways where you're uniquely capable
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:48.480]   to add value to the world.
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:51.720]   And then again, work your ass off
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:53.600]   to be the best in the world at that thing.
[02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:54.440]   - Yes.
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:55.280]   - So it's always--
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:57.880]   - But then don't waste your time on shit that's not a line.
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:35:58.720]   - Yeah, a lot of money.
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:35:59.760]   - That's the only, so that's,
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:02.400]   I guess there's a lot of context I put around that.
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:06.120]   But yeah, that was like a long answer to,
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:10.960]   a long, beautiful answer to an unanswerable question.
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:13.160]   Do you have advice outside of all this discussion
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:16.000]   to young people today about career, about life?
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.440]   Since you've done so many things,
[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:19.820]   you've overcome a lot of things.
[02:36:19.820 --> 02:36:22.760]   Think high school, college student,
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:24.960]   thinking about what to do in their life.
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:27.160]   Do you have advice for those guys and girls?
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:29.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:30.320]   (laughing)
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:33.440]   First is, you don't have it figured out.
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:34.960]   So don't worry, just jump in.
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:36.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:40.000]   - We talked a lot about understanding your values
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.460]   and aligning all that stuff,
[02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:44.680]   but you gotta have a base level
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:46.520]   of start exploring and learning
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:51.520]   and just spending the time doing like, pick something.
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.680]   Let me elaborate a little bit.
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:55.520]   - No, you know what?
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.120]   A lot of people struggle with that aspect now
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:59.040]   because the choice, there's so much choice,
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:00.200]   it's difficult to pick something,
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:01.880]   but I think it does boil down to,
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:04.040]   you should pick something and don't worry about it.
[02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:05.840]   - And then, but within that,
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:08.640]   you can start discovering the things
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:10.200]   that are there for you.
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:13.120]   Like I talked about, I made this huge shift.
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:14.660]   I threw away my whole life,
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:19.520]   but I don't regret anything about that.
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:22.040]   I wouldn't be where I was if I didn't walk through
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:23.080]   and learn those things.
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:24.960]   And in fact, in the course of that,
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:29.960]   I learned just how much that inspiring people
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:33.480]   and helping them realize the potential
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:35.400]   far beyond what they thought was capable.
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:36.240]   And guess what?
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:38.400]   That was leadership 101
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:42.240]   and managing people base level, floor level, right?
[02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:45.480]   And I got a lot out that was perfectly aligned with,
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:46.360]   and that's what I realized.
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:50.560]   It didn't matter what industry I was in
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:53.000]   or any of those other things,
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.920]   but I was able, you can see so many things.
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:57.800]   There's so many paths that you can go down
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.120]   to help you realize what those things are.
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:04.200]   And you're gonna be able to find a lot of those nuggets
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:06.280]   and develop those.
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:11.280]   Do you think that I could have just gone to school
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:15.640]   and got out and started a globally recognized brand
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:20.640]   within a few years without having been schooled in business
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:24.800]   while getting paid for it by others for years?
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:26.840]   And in fact, that entire time,
[02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:28.320]   I knew that that's what I wanted to do,
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:30.280]   but I didn't go out on it.
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:34.360]   I mentored some of my friends along the same path to go.
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:35.280]   No, they're like, "I'm ready.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:36.480]   I'm ready to go do this."
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:39.400]   And I'm like, "No, now you need to go get a job.
[02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:41.420]   Yeah, you know engineering, management, design,
[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:43.960]   all that stuff, go get a job as a manager now."
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.080]   Like, "Oh, that's a step down.
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:45.920]   I can't do that."
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:46.760]   I'm like, "Go try it."
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:47.880]   A couple of years later, "Oh my God,
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:49.080]   that was such a good move.
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:50.440]   I didn't know what I didn't know."
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:52.120]   And now they're an executive
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:54.520]   for freaking a Fortune 500 company.
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:57.280]   And the same thing, like I sat there knowing
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:00.040]   that I was getting a free education.
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:03.520]   Don't stress yourself out, that's my advice.
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:05.600]   Don't stress yourself out that you've got to have
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:08.720]   this perfect thing because this process
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:10.440]   of understanding your values and the introspect,
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:11.400]   that takes time.
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:15.740]   - You can get a job where you're getting paid to learn.
[02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:17.320]   - Exactly.
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:19.880]   - That's a good deal before you launch on your own.
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:24.060]   You mentioned going back to darkness.
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:26.420]   I'm Russian, so I like going back to darkness.
[02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:31.180]   You suffered from depression, you considered suicide.
[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:33.740]   Do you ponder your own death these days?
[02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:35.220]   Do you think about your mortality?
[02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:36.420]   Are you afraid of death?
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:40.840]   - I definitely think about mortality.
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:43.940]   And am I afraid of my own death?
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:46.180]   It depends on the moment.
[02:39:46.180 --> 02:39:48.880]   If I'm in the middle of a project,
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:51.180]   I definitely want to finish that project, man.
[02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:57.200]   But I don't fear it so much.
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:02.200]   I fear leaving my kids or my wife
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:09.180]   and not being able to be there for them.
[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:10.520]   That bothers me.
[02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:15.400]   Outside of that, I know that I put everything
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.820]   into the life that I've lived.
[02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:21.360]   Like you said, there's always more,
[02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:25.540]   but I've lived hard, I've loved hard.
[02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:32.140]   Every moment in my life, I've made connections
[02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:36.300]   and impacted people around me for the better.
[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:37.940]   And this tracks back, which is crazy
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:39.660]   when we were doing the documentary
[02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:41.500]   and they're interviewing people through my whole life
[02:40:41.500 --> 02:40:43.700]   and the consistency of the themes of anyone,
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:47.060]   like anything for Duffin, like just,
[02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:49.340]   sure, I'll fly in from Boston, all of them,
[02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:52.580]   like these people, like all of, like, it was crazy.
[02:40:52.580 --> 02:40:56.280]   Like everybody had a story about me giving,
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:57.660]   like just over and over.
[02:40:57.660 --> 02:40:58.660]   And I didn't even really--
[02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:00.340]   - It's just the way you were.
[02:41:00.340 --> 02:41:01.900]   - But I've been all in.
[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:06.060]   I don't have, like, I have a lot more I want to do,
[02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:12.460]   but I don't have things that regret have not done in,
[02:41:12.460 --> 02:41:15.260]   like, I don't fear it.
[02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:16.420]   I don't fear it.
[02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:18.020]   - Yeah, it's like the, I don't know if you know
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:20.420]   the Bukowski poem, "Go All the Way,
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:22.120]   "Otherwise Don't Even Try."
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:25.220]   It seems like you embody that poem
[02:41:25.220 --> 02:41:28.300]   and you've accomplished some incredible things
[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:30.860]   and serve as an inspiration to a huge number of people.
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:33.100]   Chris, you're an amazing human being.
[02:41:33.100 --> 02:41:35.460]   I'm really honored that you would spend
[02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:37.300]   your valuable time with me.
[02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:39.460]   Thank you so much for talking with me today.
[02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:40.300]   It was incredible.
[02:41:40.300 --> 02:41:41.980]   I can't wait to check out all the cool stuff
[02:41:41.980 --> 02:41:44.060]   you've engineered with Kabuki Strength.
[02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:47.860]   So I'm, obviously I love the, I love strength.
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:49.060]   I love strength training.
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:50.220]   I love the idea of strength.
[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:54.940]   I love the equipment and the engineering approach
[02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:56.380]   that you take to strength.
[02:41:56.380 --> 02:41:58.080]   You're an incredible human,
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:00.380]   both on the things you've accomplished
[02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:03.180]   in terms of your own strength feats
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:06.340]   and the kind of science and engineering
[02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:10.380]   you bring to the field that many others could use.
[02:42:10.380 --> 02:42:12.580]   So thank you so much for talking today.
[02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:13.420]   - Thanks for having me on.
[02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:16.940]   That was, that was quite the final.
[02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:17.780]   Thank you.
[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:20.220]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:42:20.220 --> 02:42:23.460]   with Chris Duffin, and thank you to Headspace,

[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:30.300]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:31.980]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:42:31.980 --> 02:42:34.260]   from Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:36.620]   "Strength does not come from winning.
[02:42:36.620 --> 02:42:39.360]   "Your struggles develop your strengths.
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:42.720]   "When you go through hardship and decide not to surrender,
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:44.980]   "that is strength."
[02:42:44.980 --> 02:42:47.780]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
