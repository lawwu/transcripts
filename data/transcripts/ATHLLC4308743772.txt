[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.840]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.360]   to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's education,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.200]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.920]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.960]   your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.200]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find all the
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.680]   hacks to optimize my life.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.200]   I've been asking you all to share any questions you have so I could do a Q&A
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.320]   episode, and that's exactly what today will be all about.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.560]   Also, I'm going to be putting a lot more time and effort into the All The Hacks
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.720]   newsletter in the near future.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.000]   So if you want to hear about all the cool stuff I'm learning about, some new hacks
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.120]   I'm finding, please make sure you subscribe at allthehacks.com/email.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.520]   OK, so by far the biggest questions were all around earning and redeeming points
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.840]   for maximum value.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.520]   So I'll spend a lot of time there.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.560]   I'll also share my top two to three cards for 2021 and how you might want to think
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.320]   about accumulating points with your partner.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.880]   Aside from points, we'll talk about investing questions like whether to invest
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.160]   in alternatives like wine or art, how to think about saving for college and
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.520]   automating your investments.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   Finally, I'll break down the full stack of tools, services and software I use to
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.240]   optimize my life, my finances and our home.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.800]   But first, I want to share a cool listener story that's also a great hack.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.080]   So I've been dealing with this ant problem at home, and no matter how much of that
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.760]   liquid ant bait I put around the house, they just keep coming back.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.200]   So we had some termites last year and it cost hundreds of dollars for someone to be
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.800]   here for like 45 minutes.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.360]   So I just couldn't bring myself to pay hundreds of dollars for pest control to come
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.320]   out because it seemed like such a racket.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.520]   Anyways, I started doing some research and I found this product called Pesty.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.560]   They offer a DIY version of the same pest control the pros use for under $50.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.680]   They even ask for your zip code so that you're getting a formula for the pest in
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.360]   your region. So last month, I tried it out.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.800]   You walk around your house, you spray for about five minutes, and since then, no
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.000]   ants. So I thought it was cool and I reached out to the company and small world.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.160]   One of the founders who replied was a guy named Dylan, who actually had already
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.840]   emailed me. He's an All The Hacks listener who emailed me in June after listening to
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.160]   episode one. So I told him how much I loved his product.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.000]   He said that he loved the show and I told him I wanted to mention it.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.480]   And he said, if anyone on the show is a listener and wants 10 percent off, he set up a
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.000]   promo code. So you can go to AllTheHacks.com/pesty, that's P-E-S-T-I-E, and get 10
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.960]   percent off. So thanks to our listener, Dylan, for setting that up.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.120]   All right. So let's jump in.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.600]   But of course, I still always have to remind you, I do work at Wealthfront.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.680]   All the opinions I'll express are solely my own.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.920]   They do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.320]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied on for
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   investment decisions.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.560]   All right. So with that out of the way, let's jump in and start with a great
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.440]   question. Ross emailed me and asked, if you had to pick the two or three cards to
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.600]   have in 2021, what would they be?
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.000]   Amex Gold and Sapphire Reserve?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.040]   That was his guess. And I'll say you got it half right.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.640]   I do think the Chase Sapphire Reserve is the best single card.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.920]   It's the card I carry with me all the time.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.840]   And I think for most people, travel and dining is a bulk of their spending and
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.400]   getting three points per dollar on that is fantastic.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.360]   Now, if you want to save a little bit on the annual fee and just get two points per
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.440]   dollar on travel, but now you still get three on dining, you can go for the Chase
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.480]   Sapphire Preferred.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.280]   The only thing I'll point out is that the Reserve comes with a $300 annual fee
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.200]   credit. So even though you're paying a pretty high annual fee, you get $300 back
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.480]   off any travel purchased on the card.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.120]   You don't have to use a portal or anything like that.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.080]   The other real big benefit of the Reserve is that every Chase Ultimate Reward Point
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.760]   is worth 1.5 cents if you want to redeem it in the portal.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.200]   And that's across any Chase card you have that earns points.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.120]   So I actually think the best second card for most people, if they have the Chase
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.640]   Reserve or Preferred, is the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.120]   And the reason I think that is because it's an everyday card.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.040]   It's one and a half points per dollar on everything.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.760]   So I think a great one-two combo is Reserve for travel and dining, Unlimited for
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.920]   everything else. And then all those points can take advantage of the fact that the
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.040]   Reserve gives you points value of one and a half cents if you redeem in the portal or
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.280]   if you want to transfer it to other airlines, which I'll get to in a little bit.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.160]   You could do that with all those points as well.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.440]   So that's my favorite kind of one-two combo.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.840]   If you're in the Amex ecosystem, I do think the Gold card is a great card.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.680]   You're getting 4x on restaurants and 4x on groceries.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.400]   But there's not a great earning on flights, which is something that I spend a bunch of
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.200]   money on. So I think to make the Amex combo work really well, you need the Gold and
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.240]   the Platinum. And that's just a lot of annual fees, unless you're really able to take
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.760]   advantage of the perks that the Platinum card has.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.440]   That said, if you do spend a lot on flights, five points per dollar on flights is really
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.200]   unheard of. And every now and then I've planned a group trip and I've been responsible
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.120]   for booking like 10, 15 flights all at once.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.280]   And the number of points you can earn on a Platinum card is so huge.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.520]   So I do think for that reason, if you find yourself spending a lot on flights, it could
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.440]   make sense. I also think Amex, while they have way more transfer partners, as you're
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.040]   getting into points, I think if you're not ready to jump all the way into finding the
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.120]   airline to transfer the points to, it's nice that the portal on Chase gives you one and
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.320]   a half cents, whereas on Amex, it's only one cent per point.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.280]   So I think for most people, Sapphire Reserve combo with the Unlimited is a great two
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.000]   cards to have. If I were going to add a third card, instead of trying to go for another
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.280]   ecosystem, I would really look at whether there's a place you spend a lot of money or
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.600]   have a lot of loyalty to.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.320]   That could be an airline that you fly all the time.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.000]   That could be a hotel that you stay at a lot.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.800]   That could be Amazon.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.240]   I know for me and my wife, we spend a lot on Amazon, both for Amazon Fresh delivery at
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.360]   Whole Foods and just buying stuff on Amazon.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.960]   So I would say the Sapphire Reserve, the Freedom Unlimited and the Amazon Prime Visa
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.800]   are like our three core cards.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.080]   And yes, we have a Bonvoy card for when we stay at Marriott and we have other cards.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.160]   But those are the three that I really use a lot.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.680]   OK, so that's my favorite one, two, maybe three card combo.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.120]   But Danielle and Dennis sent a question asking about whether sign up bonuses are really
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.800]   the place to accumulate points.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.400]   And I'll say I do spend a lot of time talking about the cards that I use day to day to
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.520]   maximize the points I'm earning on my spending.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.040]   But if you ask me how I got a big portion of the points I have, it's all from sign up
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.960]   bonuses. I've almost never signed up for a new card without a massive bonus.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.600]   And sometimes when I see a huge bonus, that's really the time to strike.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.640]   I do keep track of my credit score.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.000]   And I think the most important thing to think about with these sign up bonuses is you
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.400]   have to hit the minimum spend.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.440]   One time, I think I signed up for a card and this was a poor lesson to learn, but I
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.960]   didn't hit the minimum spend in time and I only got half the sign up bonus.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.760]   So I would keep track of that.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.520]   I would keep track of your credit score.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.200]   I would keep track of rules.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.600]   Chase has one where you can only open five cards in a 24 month period.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.840]   So you'll know that you'll just get declined if that happens.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.800]   And as you do this a lot, you'll find out that different credit companies, Chase is
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   another good example, will only extend a certain amount of credit.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.160]   So if you sign up for a fifth Chase card, you might get this message that says we're
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.360]   reviewing your application.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.800]   Now, the good news is you can call the reconsideration line.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.480]   There's a number, just Google Chase or Amex reconsideration line and talk to them.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.720]   Oftentimes, they'll let you say drop some of the credit on one card, transfer it to
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.080]   another card. So I think there's a lot of options there.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:41.040]   I would say the subreddit churning, that's r/churning, is a great place to go look up
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.120]   all of this information.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.320]   There's so much stuff there.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.360]   But right now, 2021, when I record this in September, there are some massive sign up
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.400]   bonuses. So I just want to run through a few of them because it's really unusual to have
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.440]   so many. So on the Chase side, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, even though I
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.520]   wouldn't use it right now because I have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, it's a
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   100,000 point sign up bonus.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.040]   So if you figure you're getting, even on the reserve, three points for travel and
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.960]   dining, you'd have to spend $33,000 on travel or dining to earn 100,000 points.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.200]   So these sign up bonuses can have a huge impact on how many points you have.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.680]   The reserve, although not as big, is at 60,000.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.960]   There's two United cards, the Explorer at 70,000 and the Quest at 100,000.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.520]   These are some really big bonuses from Chase.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.920]   On the Citi side, there's a card I've never had and I've always kind of thought about.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.840]   But, you know, for me, I didn't necessarily want to add yet another place to collect
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.600]   points is the Citi Premier card.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.200]   It's 3x points on gas, groceries, restaurants and travel.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.240]   And they have a huge 80,000 point sign up bonus right now.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.360]   Amex has a bunch as well.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.520]   The Platinum card, depending on where you sign up, could be 100 to 125,000 points.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.080]   The Gold card is 75,000 points.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.080]   The Delta cards range from 75 to 125,000 points.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.920]   And the Hilton cards range from 150 to 200,000 points.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.480]   There's just so many huge bonuses right now.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.760]   So I will say if any of those sound like places you want to accumulate points,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.040]   signing up for a new card can be a great way to get points.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.720]   And I definitely look into it, assuming you can meet the minimum spend and assuming
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.360]   that that minimum spend is spend you already need.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.680]   Don't go spend money that you don't need to spend just to meet the bonus.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.520]   It kind of reminds me of going into debt and paying interest.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.040]   It's never worth it to get those extra points.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.080]   But if you already spend enough to meet these minimum spends, the sign up bonuses
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.840]   can be huge, and they're the reason I've taken so many free trips.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.040]   Finally, if you do decide you want to sign up for any of these cards, I put
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.080]   together a page with all my card recommendations, as well as the top sign
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.440]   up bonuses right now, including some big ones for business cards.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.160]   And I'd really appreciate it if you use those links.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.960]   You can find them in the show notes on your podcast app or at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.200]   As you know, I don't have sponsors on the show right now, but I will
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.640]   earn a little bit from those links.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.200]   So if you find a better bonus somewhere else, by all means, go wherever the best
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:14.880]   bonus is.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.200]   My number one priority is you get the most points and take the most free
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:18.840]   vacations.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.520]   But if it's all the same and you want to get a new card, I'd love it if you use
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.160]   those links.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.800]   You all know I love credit card points, so I'm excited to be partnering with
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.680]   Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.840]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.480]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.080]   purchase.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.560]   You can also load it on your partner's phone so they always know the best cards
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.080]   to use.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.080]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.280]   over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.320]   America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.160]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.240]   Chase offer in just one click.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.720]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.560]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.000]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.040]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.440]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:34.360]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.440]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.280]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.000]   I get it.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.920]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.560]   good hang.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.640]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.000]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.080]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.120]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.960]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.360]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.880]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.520]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.920]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.440]   yours.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.360]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.600]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.960]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.560]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.600]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.600]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.520]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.880]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.360]   Another question from Christopher, which is actually kind of in the same vein, was
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.240]   about how to optimize points for wedding expenses.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.640]   And this could be true of a home renovation as well, or any time you have to spend a
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.040]   lot of money, but that money's not really in a category that often earns really,
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.760]   really high bonuses like travel or dining or gas or groceries.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.240]   And so, I think there's really two things to consider.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.320]   One is if you want to get some of these big signup bonuses for new cards, a great
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.720]   time to do it is when you already have a lot of spending coming up.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.040]   Some of these big bonuses come with five, $10,000 of spend.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.600]   And if you have a business card, sometimes it's even higher, but the bonuses can be
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.400]   higher as well.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.960]   And so, I think that that's a time where you say, "Look, I've got a lot of money to
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.680]   spend on my wedding.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.800]   I've already budgeted for all this spending."
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:48.120]   That could be a perfect opportunity for you to sign up for a new card and be able to
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.920]   meet that minimum spend and get that huge signup bonus.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.680]   But one thing that happened when we were getting married is I realized that, yes, I
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.400]   could get a couple points per dollar paying for a lot of these things on my credit
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.760]   card, or maybe it was only one and a half because I was probably using the Freedom
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.240]   Unlimited.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.600]   I actually offered to pay cash to a lot of vendors and asked them if there was a better
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.080]   deal.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.560]   And some vendors gave anywhere from 5% to 10% off.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:18.000]   And in that case, it was just a way better deal for me to use cash than it was to earn
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.360]   one or two points per dollar because 5% to 10% off is like an instant no-brainer.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.600]   And so, I would say negotiate for a cash deal.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.560]   And if you can't get it, and by the way, if you don't have to pay a fee to pay by
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.880]   credit card, then I would consider signing up for a card and using these expenses to
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.000]   meet the minimum spend to get a huge bonus.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.560]   Or maybe, you know, depending on how expensive your wedding is, two or three huge
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.160]   bonuses.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.120]   Okay, and if you're getting married, then you're probably already starting to think
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.400]   about how you might want to optimize points as a couple with your partner.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.920]   And this was the second most popular question.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.120]   Charlie, Brendan, Daniel all sent in asking about this.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.760]   And the big piece of it was, are you using separate cards or are you using authorized
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.600]   users or how do you do this with your partner?
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.880]   And so, I'll say for all but one card, we just are authorized users on each other's
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.000]   cards when it makes sense and when it's free.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.720]   So, my wife happens to be the Freedom Unlimited cardholder.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.360]   So, I'm an authorized user there.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.720]   I have my Chase Freedom card.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.320]   She's an authorized user there.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.680]   I've got a Bonvoy card.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.600]   She's an authorized user and so on and so on.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.960]   The one exception to that rule is that we each have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.360]   And while to some people that might not make any sense, for us, it's the card we use the
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.080]   most, so we both want one.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   And we wanted to have one card where the other person wouldn't log in and see the
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.440]   transactions each month.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.840]   So, if we wanted to buy gifts for each other, we could kind of keep it a secret.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.160]   And if you take the annual fee and you subtract off all the travel credits, the
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.880]   Peloton credit, the DoorDash credit, and you consider the fact that if one of us were an
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   authorized user on another person's card, they do charge $75, for us, it ends up being
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.720]   worth spending a little bit extra to have two cards so that we each have at least one
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.600]   credit card that's totally our own and that we can put something on that the other person
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.360]   doesn't see.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.760]   It's often gifts.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.280]   It's often around the holidays.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.680]   But that's the one exception to that rule.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.920]   One thing that was a follow-up question someone asked that I think is really important
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.760]   is, if you make someone an authorized user on your card, let's say you've had the Chase
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.160]   Sapphire Preferred for a while and your partner has been on that card, that does not
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.080]   preclude them from getting a sign-up bonus.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.720]   So, right now, they could very easily go sign up for the Sapphire Preferred and get that
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.080]   100,000-point sign-up bonus right away.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.680]   I think that it's very important to consider that because I think one of the ways we've
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:51.360]   accumulated so many points is that I played the whole points game for a few years and I
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.080]   was kind of bummed out because there weren't dozens of new cards each year.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.400]   And then I talked to my wife, I said, "Hey, what if we do this on your side?"
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.320]   So, then we just started opening up a lot of these same cards on her side and we were
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.880]   just doubling up the bonuses.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.160]   So, we've both had a Sapphire Preferred.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.760]   We've both had a Sapphire Reserve.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.680]   We've both had an Amex Platinum.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.160]   I think we've both had an Amex Gold.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.040]   And that has allowed us to accumulate a lot of points.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.760]   And funny enough, we have most of those cards today.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.000]   We might not have two of them, but we've kept a lot of them and we've been continuing to
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.440]   rack up points ever since.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.920]   When it comes to the authorized user thing, I will say, consider what the purpose of the
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.800]   card is and whether it even matters.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:36.200]   For us, the Amex Platinum is a great example where almost all of the spending goes on that
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.280]   card for flights.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.640]   And we don't buy flights in person, so we don't really need our own Amex Platinum.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.240]   Another perk of that card is that you get access to the Centurion Lounge at a lot of
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.280]   airports, but we don't travel independently enough to make it matter because you get a
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.120]   guest for free.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.560]   So we don't need to both have a Platinum card for that lounge.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.960]   So again, think about whether it even makes sense to get an authorized user if that's a
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.120]   card you use exclusively online.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.840]   We store all of our credit cards in one password.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.920]   We have a joint one password account.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.600]   I'll talk a bit more about one password at the end of this, but I can't say more about how
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.760]   much it's been helpful to be able to have all of our logins for all of our mileage
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.480]   accounts, all of our credit card numbers in one place where we can both access it.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.920]   And because we have all these cards, we have points in a lot of places.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.520]   So we do keep a spreadsheet to track all of it.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.000]   That includes where they are, whose they are, when they expire.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.600]   And while nobody asked this, I will point out that miles do expire with some programs.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.080]   And if you want to make sure they don't expire, there's a few things you can do to keep
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.240]   them around. If you have a flight or a hotel coming up, that's an easy one.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.120]   If you have that credit card, you can just spend money on it.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.080]   But let's say you happen to have a random old airline or hotel account where you don't
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.840]   have a credit card and there's nothing going in.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.600]   You could always just transfer some points there.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.480]   So if they're a Chase or an Amex partner, you could move some points over.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.320]   You could make a small redemption.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.080]   I don't know if this is as common anymore, but you used to be able to spend like 100, 200
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.080]   points to get a magazine subscription.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.240]   You could always just buy $10 or $20 worth of points to top up the balance.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.320]   Anytime that points balance changes, that almost always qualifies to extend the
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.560]   deadline. A few others are most rental car companies like Hertz or Avis will let you
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.080]   credit that rental to almost any airline.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.600]   So you could do that. Or almost any airline and hotel has a shopping portal.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.440]   And if you click through their portal, it's kind of like Ebates and Rakuten, where you
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.800]   can make a purchase online and earn a few more points.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.480]   So that's what we do to make sure that all these points that are all over the place
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.800]   never expire. But yeah, that's our strategy as a couple.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:50.920]   So David wrote in asking, "Is it even worth dealing with points and miles if you only
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.160]   fly once or twice a year?" And I'll say it really depends on where you travel and what
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.920]   class you want to travel in and what kind of hotel you want to stay at when you get
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:05.320]   there. So I think points really come in to be valuable when you're staying in really
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.400]   luxurious hotels or when you're flying business class, when you're flying
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.720]   international, or maybe even if you're flying domestic, but to obscure airports where
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.960]   there might only be a couple of flights a week.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:22.400]   So if none of those things apply or if the amount you spend on travel each year is only
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.520]   a few hundred dollars, then honestly, you might be better off just using the Citi
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.520]   Double Cash Card and getting 2% cash back and just using that cash to buy flights.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.640]   OK, so one of the hacks that I talked about before is that if you have a credit card
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.080]   that gives you a lot of points per dollar on grocery store purchases, you can actually
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.520]   buy gift cards at the grocery store to spend elsewhere.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.600]   And so David wrote in and asked, "Is there any downside to buying gift cards at the
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.000]   grocery store and specifically buying prepaid Visa gift cards?" I'd say there are two
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.680]   reasons this might not be as good as it sounds.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.640]   On the prepaid Visa card or Amex card, anything where it's not actually a specific
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.760]   retailer gift card, one of the reasons I don't like them is that you usually have to
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.680]   pay a fee. So if you get a $100 gift card and you got to pay a $4 activation fee, you
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.800]   might be getting a lot of points per dollar, but you're paying a 4% fee and chances
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.000]   are that doesn't make up for it.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.680]   So I typically won't use a credit card to earn points to buy a gift card if I have to
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.240]   pay a fee to get that gift card.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.480]   The other challenge with these prepaid cards is that it's sometimes tricky to get the
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.040]   balance down to zero. And if you ultimately have a $100 card and you only spend it down
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.440]   to $4, that's just like having a 4% fee on the card.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.600]   And I don't love that.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.440]   And one of the reasons it's tricky to get the balance to zero is there's not that many
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.920]   retailers that will let you split purchases on multiple cards.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.160]   However, a restaurant is a great place to do this.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.320]   And there's one hack that I've learned along the way.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.160]   If you tell someone to put $100 on a card at a restaurant, but it's a prepaid card that
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.800]   only has $100 balance, it often won't go through because the restaurant might
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.920]   preauthorize an amount greater than you tell them to leave room for the tip.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.480]   So what you can do is you can say for a $100 gift card, can you put $80 on this card and
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.600]   then tip $20 to get it to the full $100?
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.760]   When it comes to buying retailer gift cards, if it's already a retailer that I have a
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.840]   purchase in mind, let's say I need to spend a lot of money on something at Home Depot
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.120]   or I don't have a travel card and I want to buy some flights on Southwest.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:32.080]   I think these are great opportunities to get a lot of points, assuming you earn a lot of
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.600]   points at the grocery store.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:41.000]   But the one caveat I'll give is that Visa, MasterCard, Amex all offer some amount of
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.480]   purchase protection with their cards.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.240]   And I've used this purchase protection for a few different things.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.360]   But oftentimes, if you buy something and it breaks or you lose it within the first 90
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.000]   days, they'll refund you up to a certain amount.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And so great example was I bought an SD card and I immediately lost it a week later and I
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.720]   was able to get that completely refunded.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.800]   Warranty extension is another one.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.240]   And so sometimes if you buy something that has a one year warranty, the credit card
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.920]   company will actually give you an extra year warranty.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   So if you buy an iPhone and it breaks in the second year, Visa or Amex might actually
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.360]   cover the cost of repair that second year, even though Apple won't.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:26.480]   But when you buy gift cards, if the purchase wasn't on the original credit card, then you
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.960]   don't get a lot of those benefits.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:34.880]   So if I'm buying something on Amazon or anywhere and that purchase is of something
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.320]   that I think could break or might be easily lost or that I might need to repair, those
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.040]   are purchases that I often won't make with gift cards.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.840]   OK, and now for the big question that Stephen, Brendan, Ryan, Michael all wrote in
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.600]   asking about, how do you redeem miles to get the maximum value?
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:58.480]   So as much as I love the fact that the Chase and Amex travel portals make it really easy
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.680]   to use your miles, use your points to book travel, the way you get the really, really
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.960]   big values for your points is when you can book directly with airlines and hotels.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.240]   And to do that, you either earn points in those programs or you take Chase points or
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.880]   Amex points and you transfer them to those airline or hotel partners.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.680]   And don't forget, you're not limited to flying on just the transfer partners.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.640]   You can use miles with those partners to fly on their partner airlines.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.240]   So you could transfer Chase points to United and fly on any of the 26 different Star
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.680]   Alliance airlines like Lufthansa or Asiana or A&A, and you could transfer miles to
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.640]   British Airways and fly on any One World partner like Japan Airlines or Qantas.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   And you could transfer Amex points to Delta and fly on Korean Air or Alitalia.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.520]   And that's how you get really, really outsized value from your miles.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.800]   And like I mentioned earlier, the biggest outsized value usually comes from flying
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.560]   business class, flying to obscure destinations, flying international, staying at
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.680]   luxury hotels or doing all.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.640]   If you're trying to take a long flight to an obscure destination in business class,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:13.200]   that can sometimes get you 10 cents per point or mile, which is really, really crazy
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.440]   compared to what it would cost otherwise in cash.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.960]   A great example of this is a flight that my neighbor Joe recently booked.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   So he was looking to take his family of four to Europe and was trying to do it in
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.200]   business class, was sitting on a lot of miles and managed to find that if he
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:37.640]   transferred 440,000 miles from Chase to Air France, he was able to book four round
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.680]   trip business class tickets to Europe.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:46.360]   Now, those tickets would normally cost somewhere on the order of four or $5,000
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:52.560]   each, but if he had used 440,000 miles in the travel portal on Chase, he would have
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.160]   gotten one and a half cents per mile and he would have been able to book $6,600
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.960]   worth of flights, which wouldn't have even gotten him two tickets.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.400]   So he got crazy value.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.000]   So the question isn't really how do you get the crazy value?
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:11.040]   It's clear that it's from luxury travel, luxury hotels, international trips.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.080]   The real challenge is how do you find the availability?
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.160]   And I'll give you three ways to do it.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:23.160]   There's a DIY approach, there's a premium paid search approach, and then there's
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.040]   paid award booking services that will do it all for you.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:31.960]   So you could do all this for free with a DIY approach, which basically involves
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.680]   going to the websites of all the airline partners and searching for
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.960]   the flights you want yourself.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.920]   So Chase has, you know, 10 different airline partners.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.440]   You could go to the United website and search for flights.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   You could then go to the Flying Blue website or the British Airways site.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.440]   And the downside is that it's a lot of searching and the more flexible you are
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.320]   with dates, the more searching you have to do.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.760]   And depending on the airline, you might actually have to go in and create a
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.480]   mileage account with each airline you're searching, but it's 100% free and it
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.360]   totally works, and in general, I always say it's a great starting point.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.680]   If you have a bunch of Chase points, maybe just go to United's website
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.960]   and see if you find the flight.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.720]   If you have a bunch of Amex points, maybe it's Air Canada, maybe it's Delta, and
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.560]   just search the sites just to get a quick glance, but if you don't see what you
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.960]   want at the very beginning, you might want to consider paid sites because they
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.480]   make the searching a lot easier.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.360]   So I used to always recommend JuicyMiles.com because it was easy and
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.120]   fantastic, but it seems as of a few weeks ago, they're transitioning to a new brand,
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.560]   which is Point.me, and while it does appear that they finally put the search
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.880]   on their site, I think it's still a little broken.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.640]   So maybe by the time you're listening to this, it's working.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.280]   I really hope it does because it's a fantastic product when it was working,
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.560]   but right now it's really hard to recommend because it doesn't work.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.200]   Another paid search site is ExpertFlyer.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.840]   It doesn't support every airline, but they do let you search plus or minus three
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.120]   days, so you can search a little bit more and so you can go in and search by airline.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:10.440]   Or I think one of the best products with a couple caveats is KVS Availability Tool.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.400]   Now, you need a PC and you need to be comfortable using an interface that looks
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.600]   like it was made 10 or 20 years ago, but they support more airlines than anyone
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.120]   else, and if you do have a Mac, you can use it with an emulator like VirtualBox,
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.080]   but it definitely has a learning curve.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.520]   So I wouldn't recommend it if you don't want to go deep down the rabbit hole.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.280]   And I really hope for your sake that the juicy miles to point.me transition is
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.880]   made by the time you need it because it's just such an easier product to use.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.480]   One thing to keep in mind with any of these searches, whether you're doing it
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.800]   manually on the airline websites or using a tool, is that you're only going to find
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.480]   availability when it exists for your entire trip.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.920]   So I'd say it's worth looking for flights to major cities and buying a paid
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.680]   ticket for a short flight at the end.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:01.200]   So for example, we recently tried to go to Santorini in Greece and there
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.040]   was basically no availability.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.080]   But we looked for flights round trip to Athens and got them in business class
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.320]   with points, and then we just bought a $50 30 minute flight to get to the island.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.760]   So if you're flying to Thailand on an island, maybe you just search for flights
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.960]   to Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur or Singapore instead, or if you're going somewhere in
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.480]   Europe, maybe search for London, Paris or Frankfurt if you don't find your
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.960]   original destination right away.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.400]   This is also true for departing cities.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.320]   So I live right near SFO and while my preference is always to fly directly
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.600]   from here, one time we wanted to go to Tokyo and there just wasn't anything.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.760]   So we took two business class flights from LA and we just bought a cheap $75
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.720]   ticket to LA and flew direct from there in an amazing lie-flat business seat on
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.120]   ANA, which by the way is fantastic.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.280]   Finally, if all of this sounds like a lot of work, but you're sitting on lots of
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.640]   points and want to take an epic trip, there are award booking services, which
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.680]   are basically like paying someone like me, but better, who has access to all
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.840]   these tools and knows the ins and outs of everything, promotions, what's going
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.360]   on right now, who's got the right availability, and they will go and find
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.800]   all of your travel for you.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:19.880]   Depending on which site you use, they can cost anywhere from one to $200 a person.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.160]   Some of them just charge a fee to get started and if they don't find you
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.440]   anything, they don't actually end up charging you.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.920]   I know that Juicy Miles ran a service like this and now Point.me has
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.440]   their full service concierge.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.080]   I've heard great things about it.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:34.920]   So check that out.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.200]   Or if you just search award booking service online, you'll find
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.080]   dozens of companies that do this.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   Hey everybody.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.640]   I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point.me, my favorite
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.400]   award search tool, to give you a special offer of only $1 for your first month
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:56.200]   of their standard plan, if you go to allthehacks.com/pointme and use the
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:04.120]   promo code HACKS, again, allthehacks.com/P-O-I-N-T-M-E, or find the link
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.000]   in the show notes, so definitely take advantage of that if you're
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.320]   planning a trip with points.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.120]   So that's all flights.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.080]   We didn't talk at all about hotels and that's because they're a little easier.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.120]   If you already have hotel points with a specific program, then great.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.960]   Just search on their website and there really isn't much more to do.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.440]   And while Chase and Amex each have hotel partners, other than transferring
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.600]   Chase points to Hyatt, I don't think you should waste your time.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.000]   That said, I think some of the best points redemptions I've ever
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.560]   had are booking through Hyatt.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.600]   For Christmas in 2019, we stayed at the Park Hyatt Kyoto.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.360]   It was 30,000 points a night, which probably would have gotten me four or
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.400]   $500 booking through the portal, but that room was almost $1,300.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.480]   So it was a fantastic redemption.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:56.440]   If you do really want to take epic trips to hotels, and for whatever reason, Chase
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.320]   Points or Hyatt is not interesting, the way you're going to want to do it is to
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.240]   get a credit card with a hotel chain.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.280]   And the reason why is that so many of the transferable points, Chase,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.320]   Citi, Amex, they transfer one-to-one.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:17.760]   But for almost all hotel chains, except Hyatt, the value of hotel points is about
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.360]   half to a third the value of airline points.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.560]   So you're just always going to get a better deal transferring your
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.720]   Chase or Amex points to airlines.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:31.560]   That said, credit cards for hotel companies have much higher earnings.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.920]   So if you want to earn hotel points, you're better off getting a hotel
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:40.160]   card that earns five, six, maybe even seven points per dollar on different
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.160]   categories, and really helps you rack up points on a hotel program like
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.920]   Marriott's Bonvoy or Hilton Honors.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.360]   Okay.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.360]   I know that was a lot, but so many of you asked that question.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.600]   So hopefully that was helpful.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.760]   If I missed anything, please reach out.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.240]   I'm happy to help clarify.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.720]   I probably should just write a big guide to this, and I
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.880]   probably will at some point.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.920]   But for now, I hope that helps.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.480]   So there's still a bunch of other questions people wrote in.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.680]   I'm going to start next with investing because we got a lot of questions there.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.120]   Before we get back to the episode, I just want to thank you for
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.920]   listening to and supporting the show.

[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.560]   So Josh wrote in and asked what type of setup I have for my 529.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.240]   And Swarupa wrote in asking about investments and planning for
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.480]   kids coming into the world.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.760]   So I'll just share a little bit about what I do.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:48.400]   So I set up a 529 at Wealthfront, and at first glance, I thought, even as an
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:54.320]   employee, do I really want to pay a fee for my 529 given that tax benefits of the
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.600]   automation aren't as relevant when you have tax-free gains like you do in a 529?
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:05.600]   Ultimately, I did some research and I came to the conclusion that most 529s that you
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:10.640]   sign up for online don't have as much opportunity for diversification as
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.440]   Wealthfront offered.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.280]   And so for me, the extra risk-adjusted return I thought I would get from that
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.000]   diversification made up for the fee.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.360]   And so that's what I went ahead and did.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.040]   Now, last week, I talked to Andy Ratcliffe, and he brought up a really
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.400]   important point about liquidity.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.840]   I would say one thing to consider is that when you put money in a 529, that money
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.120]   needs to be used for educational expenses.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.280]   Now, the good news is it doesn't just have to be college.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.480]   It could be for private school.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.160]   And if you don't end up needing it for your children, you could pass it on to
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:42.960]   their children.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.320]   And there are even some circumstances where you might be able to withdraw it if
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.640]   your children get scholarships.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.920]   But I will say you can't use it to buy a home.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.880]   You can't use it to pay for medical expenses.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:57.560]   So do make sure you have enough liquidity outside of a 529 to be able to cover
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.960]   things like that that might come up.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:04.080]   And realize that the value of not having to borrow or pay fees if you do need that
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.680]   money is probably going to be greater than the tax advantage you'll get from a
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.440]   529.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.720]   So as for trying to predict how much you need to contribute, there are lots of
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.600]   tools online.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.120]   We've built one at Wealthfront where you can go in and pick whether it's a state
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.720]   school or a private school and kind of get a sense of what that's expected to cost
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.160]   and how much you need to contribute and then just start making contributions.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.640]   One other financial thing when it comes to planning for kids is making sure you
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.680]   have the right insurance plan.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.720]   So when you're young and healthy, it might have made a lot of sense to get a
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.840]   high deductible health plan with an HSA and contribute each year because you
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.040]   weren't going to the doctor that often.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.840]   But it turns out if you haven't looked up, having a baby is quite expensive.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.760]   And if you're using a high deductible health plan, it's very likely that you
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.400]   will go through that entire deductible and it will probably not have been your
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.600]   best choice that year if you had access to a PPO or an EPO.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.680]   One of my favorite plans, assuming all of the doctors and facilities you want to
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.840]   use are in-network, is an EPO.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.640]   Usually it's the cheapest cost for you if you're in-network, but the downside is
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.920]   you can't go out of network.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.720]   I was fortunate that the EPO my company offered had all the facilities we wanted
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.360]   to go to in-network.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.920]   And so I signed up for that and my wife had an EPO through her plan and the
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:24.160]   entire cost of pregnancy and childbirth was less than $500.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.520]   Another question that I get a lot, and specifically this time from Josh, is how
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.440]   do you think about allocating to alternative strategies?
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:38.800]   This could include things like crypto, wine, art, angel investing, etc.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.720]   The way I think about it in general is that I keep a small amount of my
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.840]   portfolio on things that are exciting, things that are fun, things that I think
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:52.360]   I might have an edge on, but at the end of the day, I keep the vast majority, 90
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.040]   plus percent, in a long-term, diverse, passive investment strategy.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.480]   And so as my net worth has grown, that kind of small, less than 10% piece has
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.800]   gotten big enough that I've been able to do some extra things.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.320]   So some of that was buying some Bitcoin.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.000]   I've invested in a few companies I was really interested in, and I've made a few
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.400]   other small investments in projects I was excited by.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.320]   But at the end of the day, I haven't actually really
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.080]   purchased a lot of alternatives.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.440]   I haven't gone and purchased any fractional art or any wine, other
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.680]   than the wine I buy to drink.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.480]   But if you want to dive a little deeper, definitely check out the episode I did
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.400]   with Andy Ratcliffe, or keep an eye out for an upcoming episode of the Modern
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.160]   Finance podcast, where I talk about how much to consider allocating in
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.920]   your portfolio to cryptocurrency.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.760]   Finally, Jeremiah asked me, "How can I send money into an
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.480]   account and automatically invest it?"
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.840]   Now, this is a fantastic question, because it's just
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.560]   something that seems so broken.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.640]   There are so few brokerage firms that will allow you to do any kind of
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.720]   recurring purchases, and almost none that will let you do it with a portfolio.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:04.000]   Instead, you're forced to deposit money and set up a trade every time you want
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.720]   to make an individual investment.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.640]   So, I might sound like a broken record, but I use WealthRent for this.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.920]   In fact, when I joined, I spent the first 18 months working on building
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.200]   automated investing, so that you could say, "I want to deposit money, and I
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.280]   want it to automatically go here and do this," which could mean keep a certain
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:28.080]   amount in cash, then transfer $200 a month into my IRA, and then invest the
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.240]   rest in a portfolio that looks like this.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.440]   And you can customize that portfolio to whatever types of investments you want.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.680]   I do think there are probably a few other brokerage firms that allow this.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.320]   I know that Vanguard allows you to set up direct deposit, but you still
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.040]   have to set up the individual trades.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.280]   I also believe that Robinhood lets you make recurring purchases, but you have
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.880]   to set it up for each individual security or index fund.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.360]   So, I really think this is one of the things that RoboAdvisors and WealthFront
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.560]   specifically have put together to make this really easy.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.040]   So, if that's interesting, definitely check it out.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.760]   And last episode, Andy shared that if you go to WealthFront.com/Andy, you can
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.720]   get your first $5,000 managed for free.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.320]   All right, that's it with investing.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.160]   I want to jump into the different tools and services I use to optimize everything I do.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.000]   And Josh wrote in specifically asking about financial and investment tools,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.920]   so I'll start there.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:24.360]   When it comes to tracking my points, my budget, spending, net worth,
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.360]   there's really three tools I use.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.120]   I track all my points, and I create a budget in Google Sheets.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.520]   It's as simple as that.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.360]   I do use Mint to sync all of my transactions from all of my credit cards,
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.480]   so I can try to get a good sense of how much I'm spending each month.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.800]   I don't love Mint, but it's free.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:47.280]   Although I have heard really fantastic things about Copilot, Jesse from YNAB
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.800]   really lured me in that direction.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:54.120]   And Tiller is a really cool product that lets you sync data into Google Sheets.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.960]   But at the end of the day, I think Mint being free works for this
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.600]   very specific purpose well.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.080]   And I'll be honest, I oftentimes just export all the data out of Mint and just
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.480]   bring it right into another spreadsheet.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.120]   And then finally, I use Wealthfront for tracking my net worth.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.560]   I sync all of my accounts there, and I can just see how it's going.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.800]   I can use that for planning for the future.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.280]   I go in and say, "This is how much I'm going to save each month," and I can
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.880]   project my net worth, slide around my retirement age, and all that.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.920]   When it comes to insurance, I am not loyal to any particular insurance company.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:33.520]   In fact, we use Geico for car, we use Lemonade for our home, we use Travelers
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.920]   for my wife's engagement ring.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:40.000]   So honestly, every year or so, I just go on, I do some quick searching on
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.880]   different providers to see if one is cheaper, and I'm happy to
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.080]   switch at any point in time.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.920]   Taxes.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.520]   Up until a few years ago, I used TurboTax for everything.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.480]   And then it just got to a point in life where the different types of
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.000]   investments, the different businesses, everything was just enough that I
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.960]   was done doing it myself, and I used a firm called Anderson.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.840]   It's not cheap, but if you are in a situation where your taxes are
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.760]   complicated enough that you want to spend a few thousand dollars a year
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.320]   at minimum, definitely encourage you to check them out or email me, and
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.560]   I'm happy to make an introduction.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.240]   Once we had a child, we really started to think about estate
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.040]   planning, trusts, wills.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.800]   One hack here is that some big employers offer a legal benefit where you can pay
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.600]   a small amount of money each month, and it gives you access to free legal services.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:32.320]   So our first estate plan and will and trust and healthcare directives
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.600]   and all that good stuff, we set up with a lawyer through the
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.960]   legal program that Google had.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.640]   Recently, after having a child, we decided to update everything, and I
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.680]   went ahead and set everything up with Trust & Will.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.640]   I got a chance to meet the founders of Trust & Will.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.080]   I thought they were fantastic.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.200]   I'm not an investor.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.240]   I'm not an advisor.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.760]   I'm not a shareholder, but I just think the product's great.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.880]   And if you want to get 15% off, I emailed the founder, Cody.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.640]   He set me up with a promo code, allthehacks.com/trustandwill, and you'll
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.720]   get 15% off when you sign up, and I'll put a link to that in the show notes.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.400]   Finally, when it comes to brokerage, it's probably no surprise that almost
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.920]   all of my investments are at Wealthfront.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:15.120]   So I use that for my taxable brokerage, my 529, my Roth IRA.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.800]   I have 401ks wherever they are.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.320]   Wealthfront happens to be at Vanguard.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:24.680]   And if I do trade any individual stocks, I do that at Interactive Brokers.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.120]   I would not recommend Interactive Brokers to most people.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:32.920]   I would much prefer or recommend something like Schwab or Vanguard.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.880]   But the reason I love Interactive Brokers is that they do offer the ability to borrow
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.480]   against your stock positions for, right now, I think it's 0.75%.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   So there have been a couple of times where I've wanted to do that, and that
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.160]   rate makes it worth the fact that they have one of the worst user interfaces
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.480]   I've seen in my entire life.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.680]   Finally, one other one, HSAs.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.560]   I do have an HSA from a few years ago.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.040]   And one thing I didn't realize until recently is that you can actually
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.120]   transfer your HSA to a new provider.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:09.320]   And many of the HSAs that I've seen or that I've personally had through my
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.120]   employer are terrible and ridden with so many fees.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.720]   I love this startup called Lively.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.640]   I transferred my HSA there.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.040]   They set you up with a Fidelity account.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.360]   You can invest your HSA however you want.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.200]   And again, I have no affiliation with this company other than I think
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.400]   they have a fantastic product.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.480]   So I moved my HSA over to Lively.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.680]   I think that covers all of the kind of investing and financial things.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.200]   But I got an email from John asking how I use an app called Alfred.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.760]   And instead of diving into that right away, I thought I'd just give a high-level
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.280]   overview of the types of apps and software I use to make everything more efficient.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.320]   So the biggest thing that I think I couldn't live without is Gmail keyboard shortcuts.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.480]   If you haven't turned those on, I don't even know how I would operate without being
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.120]   able to fly through my inbox without shortcuts.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.160]   They aren't the most intuitive shortcuts, but I promise that as soon as you figure
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.040]   it out, it'll make email so much faster.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.320]   For storing stuff, I just use Google Drive and Dropbox.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.760]   For some reason, I have both of them.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.560]   I'm not really sure.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.120]   I've decided to use one of them for kind of podcasts and all that stuff
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.960]   and Google Drive for everything else.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.600]   On my Mac, I use an app called Alfred, and it's probably the most important app I have.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.920]   It replaces the spotlight search when you press command space bar.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.880]   I use that to find any file on my computer.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.480]   I use that to look for contact information.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:35.920]   I use it for snippets where I can create a shortcut for longer pieces of text, like a
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.680]   known traveler number or an address.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.960]   And I can just type in a couple of letters and automatically expand that to what I want.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:50.320]   I actually use that for emojis, so I can spell out an emoji like S space thumbs up
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.400]   will immediately give the thumbs up emoji.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.720]   So I can use those faster.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.520]   I use it to do calculations.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.320]   It actually stores your clipboard so I can search things that I've copied and
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.600]   pasted days or even weeks ago.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.160]   And then finally, I use it for custom web search.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:11.120]   So things like Google Drive, I have it set up so I can really quickly just type
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.480]   in, you know, like S G and then just search Google Drive straight from there.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.360]   And it'll pull up a website and search Google Drive.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.800]   So Alfred is a fantastic product.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.320]   I gladly pay for it myself and I use it probably a hundred times a day.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.120]   Another app I use a lot is called Rectangle.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.000]   I used to use an app called Spectacle.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.040]   I actually think I have one on each computer, but I love that Rectangle is open source.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.880]   And really all it lets you do is very quickly and easily with keyboard shortcuts,
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.160]   move things around your screen.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:45.040]   So it'll let you quickly take one window and jump it to the right half of your
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.880]   screen and then take the other window and you can jump into the left half or the top
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.040]   and bottom halves, just to kind of manipulate things and move them around quickly.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.240]   And 1Password is a fantastic piece of software.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.840]   I use it every day.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.480]   We have a family plan that my wife and my parents are on.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:05.120]   I store credit cards, passports, logins for every website.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.440]   I use it to create a unique login for every website so that I don't have any
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.080]   passwords that are duplicated.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:15.200]   I store a lot of two-factor codes in there instead of Google Authenticator.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.960]   It's great because you can access those codes from your computer or your phone.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.800]   I'm a huge fan of 1Password.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.360]   I've been paying for it since 2013.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:29.440]   And if you go to allthehacks.com/1password, you can try it for free for 14 days.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.800]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.680]   All right.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.840]   Notion is another piece of software I use a ton.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.640]   It's a web app, but I use it all the time to organize my thoughts.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.320]   We have a whole Notion setup for our home and, you know, just keeping
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.560]   track of everything there.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.280]   Our childcare schedule.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.960]   I use another Notion doc for our podcast.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.680]   So where Google Docs, everything is a doc and you have to link to another doc.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.160]   This has a bunch of hierarchy.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.840]   And so I use it to organize thoughts on so much.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.040]   Another new one is an app called BlueStacks.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.240]   It's a Android emulator for the Mac.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.040]   And I don't really do any Android development, but why I think it's
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:12.360]   fantastic is there's always a handful of mobile apps that just don't have a
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.080]   website, don't have a web version.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.680]   And a great example of that is our baby monitor.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.920]   We use an app called Nanit.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.160]   And there's not a way to access the camera from your computer, but when I'm
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.440]   working, sometimes I want to check and, you know, keep an eye on our daughter.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.960]   And so I just pull up BlueStacks and I'm able to do that there.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.760]   So it's a free piece of software that basically gives you access to everything
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.240]   on Android on your computer.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.640]   So I think that's the core of the apps I use on a day-to-day basis that really
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.560]   helped me be much more efficient with my life.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:45.800]   I think that wraps up this listener Q&A episode.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.440]   I hope there was a lot of information that was helpful and there will be links to
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.240]   everything we discussed in the show notes.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.080]   If you were one of the people that wrote in, hopefully you got a great answer to
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:54.640]   your question.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.920]   If you have other questions, please feel free to reach out.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.200]   Chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.440]   Ask away.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.680]   We'll do this again and I'll try to get to as many questions as possible or I'll
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.840]   respond to you on email.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.400]   This was a lot of fun for me.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.280]   I really enjoy hearing from you guys.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.840]   So please keep that up.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.040]   Finally, I'll just say it again.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.600]   If you haven't signed up for the All The Hacks newsletter, that is going to be the
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.200]   primary way outside of this podcast that I communicate, send hacks and give updates.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.520]   So please head over to allthehacks.com/email and you could sign up and I will get that
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.640]   next issue out shortly.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.400]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.480]   I really appreciate it.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.320]   We'll be back with a guest next week.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.080]   See you then.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   [music]
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.140]   you
