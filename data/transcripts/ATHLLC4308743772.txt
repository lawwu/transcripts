[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.720]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.920]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find all
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.680]   the hacks to optimize my life.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.520]   I've been asking you all to share any questions you have so I could do a
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.320]   Q&A episode, and that's exactly what today will be all about.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.560]   Also, I'm going to be putting a lot more time and effort into the All The Hacks
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.680]   newsletter in the near future.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.960]   So if you want to hear about all the cool stuff I'm learning about, some new hacks
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.080]   I'm finding, please make sure you subscribe at allthehacks.com/email.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.920]   Okay, so by far the biggest questions were all around earning and redeeming
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.800]   points for maximum value.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.520]   So I'll spend a lot of time there.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.560]   I'll also share my top two to three cards for 2021 and how you might want to think
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.360]   about accumulating points with your partner.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.880]   Aside from points, we'll talk about investing questions like whether to invest
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.160]   in alternatives like wine or art, how to think about saving for college, and
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.560]   automating your investments.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.640]   Finally, I'll break down the full stack of tools, services, and software I use to
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.240]   optimize my life, my finances, and our home.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.840]   But first, I want to share a cool listener story that's also a great hack.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   So I've been dealing with this ant problem at home.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.520]   And no matter how much of that liquid ant bait I put around the house, they
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.760]   just keep coming back.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.160]   So we had some termites last year and it cost hundreds of dollars for someone to be
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.800]   here for like 45 minutes.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.120]   So I just couldn't bring myself to pay hundreds of dollars for pest control to
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.280]   come out because it seemed like such a racket.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.480]   Anyways, I started doing some research and I found this product called Pesty.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   They offer a DIY version of the same pest control the pros use for under $50.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.680]   They even ask for your zip code so that you're getting a formula for the pest in
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.280]   your region.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.360]   So last month, I tried it out.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.800]   You walk around your house, you spray for about five minutes, and since then, no
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.200]   ants.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.440]   So I thought it was cool and I reached out to the company and small world, one of the
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.880]   founders who replied was a guy named Dylan, who actually had already emailed me.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.600]   He's an All The Hacks listener who emailed me in June after listening to episode one.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.160]   So I told him how much I loved his product.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.000]   He said that he loved the show and I told him I wanted to mention it.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.520]   And he said, if anyone on the show is a listener and wants 10% off, he set up a
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.280]   promo code.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.520]   So you can go to AllTheHacks.com/Pesty and get 10% off.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   So thanks to our listener, Dylan, for setting that up.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.160]   All right, so let's jump in.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.640]   But of course, I still always have to remind you, I do work at Wealthfront.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.760]   All the opinions I'll express are solely my own.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.000]   They do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.360]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied on for
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.400]   investment decisions.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.600]   All right, so with that out of the way, let's jump in and start with a great
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.160]   question.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   Ross emailed me and asked, if you had to pick the two or three cards to have in
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.680]   2021, what would they be?
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.000]   Amex Gold and Sapphire Reserve, that was his guess.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.040]   And I'll say, you got it half right.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.640]   I do think the Chase Sapphire Reserve is the best single card.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.920]   It's the card I carry with me all the time.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.840]   And I think for most people, travel and dining is a bulk of their spending and
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.400]   getting three points per dollar on that is fantastic.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.240]   Now, if you want to save a little bit on the annual fee and just get two points
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.200]   per dollar on travel, but now you still get three on dining, you can go for the
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.440]   Chase Sapphire Preferred.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.280]   The only thing I'll point out is that the Reserve comes with a $300 annual fee
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.880]   credit.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.920]   So even though you're paying a pretty high annual fee, you get $300 back off any
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.480]   travel purchased on the card.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.120]   You don't have to use a portal or anything like that.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.080]   The other real big benefit of the Reserve is that every Chase Ultimate Reward Point
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.800]   is worth 1.5 cents if you want to redeem it in the portal.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.240]   And that's across any Chase card you have that earns points.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.080]   So I actually think the best second card for most people, if they have the Chase
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.600]   Reserve or Preferred, is the Freedom Unlimited.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.040]   And the reason I think that is because it's an everyday card.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.960]   It's one and a half points per dollar on everything.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.520]   So I think a great one-two combo is Reserve for travel and dining, Unlimited
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.560]   for everything else.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.280]   And then all those points can take advantage of the fact that the Reserve
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   gives you points value of one and a half cents if you redeem in the portal or if
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.200]   you want to transfer it to other airlines, which I'll get to in a little bit.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.080]   You could do that with all those points as well.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.360]   So that's my favorite kind of one-two combo.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.760]   If you're in the Amex ecosystem, I do think the Gold card is a great card.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.640]   You're getting 4x on restaurants and 4x on groceries, but there's not a great
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.760]   earning on flights, which is something that I spend a bunch of money on.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.200]   So I think to make the Amex combo work really well, you need the Gold and the
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.160]   Platinum, and that's just a lot of annual fees, unless you're really able to take
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.680]   advantage of the perks that the Platinum card has.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.040]   That said, if you do spend a lot on flights, five points per dollar on
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.040]   flights is really unheard of.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.280]   And every now and then I've planned a group trip and I've been responsible for
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.040]   booking like 10, 15 flights all at once.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   And the number of points you can earn on a Platinum card is so huge.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   So I do think for that reason, if you find yourself spending a lot on flights,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.000]   it could make sense.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.720]   I also think Amex, while they have way more transfer partners, as you're getting
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.960]   into points, I think if you're not ready to jump all the way into finding the
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.720]   airline to transfer the points to, it's nice that the portal on Chase gives you
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.200]   one and a half cents, whereas on Amex, it's only one cent per point.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.440]   So I think for most people, Sapphire Reserve combo with the Unlimited is a
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.040]   great two cards to have.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.880]   If I were going to add a third card, instead of trying to go for another
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.720]   ecosystem, I would really look at whether there's a place you spend a lot of
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.480]   money or have a lot of loyalty to.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.240]   That could be an airline that you fly all the time.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.920]   That could be a hotel that you stay at a lot.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.720]   That could be Amazon.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.120]   I know for me and my wife, we spent a lot on Amazon, both for Amazon Fresh
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.280]   delivery at Whole Foods and just buying stuff on Amazon.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.520]   So I would say the Sapphire Reserve, the Freedom Unlimited and the Amazon Prime
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.720]   Visa are like our three core cards.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.600]   And yes, we have a Bonvoy card for when we stay at Marriott and we have other
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.120]   cards, but those are the three that I really use a lot.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.600]   Okay, so that's my favorite one, two, maybe three card combo.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.760]   But Danielle and Dennis sent a question asking about whether signup bonuses are
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.800]   really the place to accumulate points.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.880]   And I'll say, I do spend a lot of time talking about the cards that I use day to
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.440]   day to maximize the points I'm earning on my spending.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.040]   But if you ask me how I got a big portion of the points I have, it's all from signup
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.960]   bonuses. I've almost never signed up for a new card without a massive bonus.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.600]   And sometimes when I see a huge bonus, that's really the time to strike.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.640]   I do keep track of my credit score.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.680]   And I think the most important thing to think about with these signup bonuses is
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.400]   you have to hit the minimum spend.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.440]   One time I think I signed up for a card and this was a poor lesson to learn, but I
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.960]   didn't hit the minimum spend in time and I only got half the signup bonus.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.760]   So I would keep track of that.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.520]   I would keep track of your credit score.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.200]   I would keep track of rules.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.600]   Chase has one where you can only open five cards in a 24 month period.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.840]   So you'll know that you'll just get declined if that happens.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.800]   And as you do this a lot, you'll find out that different credit companies, Chase is
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   another good example, will only extend a certain amount of credit.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.160]   So if you sign up for a fifth Chase card, you might get this message that says we're
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.360]   reviewing your application.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.760]   Now, the good news is you can call the reconsideration line.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.400]   There's a number, just Google Chase or Amex reconsideration line and talk to them.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.640]   Oftentimes they'll let you say drop some of the credit on one card, transfer it to
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.440]   another card.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.040]   So I think there's a lot of options there.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.960]   I would say the subreddit churning, that's r/churning, is a great place to go look up
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.080]   all of this information.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.280]   There's so much stuff there.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.320]   But right now, 2021, when I record this in September, there are some massive signup
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:49.920]   bonuses.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.640]   So I just want to run through a few of them because it's really unusual to have so
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:54.960]   many.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.920]   So on the Chase side, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, even though I wouldn't use
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.040]   it right now because I have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, it's a 100,000 point signup
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.520]   bonus.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.040]   So if you figure you're getting, even on the Reserve, three points for travel and
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.960]   dining, you'd have to spend $33,000 on travel or dining to earn 100,000 points.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.160]   So these signup bonuses can have a huge impact on how many points you have.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.680]   The Reserve, although not as big, is at 60,000.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.960]   There's two United cards, the Explorer at 70,000 and the Quest at 100,000.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.520]   These are some really big bonuses from Chase.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.520]   On the Citi side, there's a card I've never had and I've always kind of thought
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.800]   about, but for me, I didn't necessarily want to add yet another place to collect
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.560]   points is the Citi Premier card.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.680]   It's 3x points on gas, groceries, restaurants, and travel, and they have a
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.200]   huge 80,000 point signup bonus right now.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.320]   Amex has a bunch as well.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.480]   The Platinum card, depending on where you sign up, could be 100 to 125,000 points.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.040]   The Gold card is 75,000 points.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.760]   The Delta cards range from 75 to 125,000 points, and the Hilton cards range from
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.840]   150 to 200,000 points.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.360]   There's just so many huge bonuses right now.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.680]   So I will say, if any of those sound like places you want to accumulate points,
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.960]   signing up for a new card can be a great way to get points.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.040]   And I definitely look into it, assuming you can meet the minimum spend and
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.240]   assuming that that minimum spend is spend you already need.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.600]   Don't go spend money that you don't need to spend just to meet the bonus.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.440]   It kind of reminds me of going into debt and paying interest.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.960]   It's never worth it to get those extra points.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.000]   But if you already spend enough to meet these minimum spends, the signup bonuses
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.760]   can be huge, and they're the reason I've taken so many free trips.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.000]   Finally, if you do decide you want to sign up for any of these cards, I put
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.120]   together a page with all my card recommendations, as well as the top signup
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.400]   bonuses right now, including some big ones for business cards.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.120]   And I'd really appreciate it if you use those links.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.920]   You can find them in the show notes on your podcast app or at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.160]   As you know, I don't have sponsors on the show right now, but I will
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.600]   earn a little bit from those links.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.160]   So if you find a better bonus somewhere else, by all means, go wherever the best
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.800]   bonus is.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.160]   My number one priority is you get the most points and take the most free
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.800]   vacations.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.480]   But if it's all the same and you want to get a new card, I'd love it if you use
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.120]   those links.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.760]   It seems like with every business you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.320]   emerge.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.440]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.400]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.480]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.640]   37,025, 1.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.040]   37,000.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.840]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.960]   I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.040]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system streamlining accounting,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.800]   financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.200]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.000]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.760]   days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.320]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.560]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system with
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.760]   one source of truth.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.680]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts and improve margins.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.080]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.880]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:41.680]   consistently excellent performance, absolutely free at allthehacks.com/netsuite.

[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.520]   You all know I love credit card points, so I'm excited to be partnering with
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.600]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.280]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:09.840]   purchase.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.280]   You can also load it on your partner's phone, so they always know the best cards
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:14.840]   to use.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.800]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.840]   America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.720]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.760]   Chase offer in just one click.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.320]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.120]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.280]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well, so you can
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.280]   download them as well.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.360]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.720]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:03.600]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.680]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:13.800]   Another question from Christopher, which is actually kind of in the same vein, was
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.680]   about how to optimize points for wedding expenses.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.840]   It's true of a home renovation as well, or any time you have to spend a lot of
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.200]   money, but that money's not really in a category that often earns really, really
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.680]   high bonuses like travel or dining or gas or groceries.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.160]   And so I think there's really two things to consider.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.240]   One is if you want to get some of these big signup bonuses for new cards, a great
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.680]   time to do it is when you already have a lot of spending coming up.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.960]   Some of these big bonuses come with $5,000, $10,000 of spend.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.520]   And if you have a business card, sometimes it's even higher, but the bonuses can be
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.320]   higher as well.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.880]   And so I think that that's a time where you say, look, I've got a lot of money to
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.600]   spend on my wedding.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.720]   I've already budgeted for all this spending.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.880]   That could be a perfect opportunity for you to sign up for a new card and be able
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.760]   to meet that minimum spend and get that huge signup bonus.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:10.360]   But one thing that happened when we were getting married is I realized that, yes,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.000]   I could get a couple points per dollar paying for a lot of these things on my
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.320]   credit card, or maybe it was only one and a half because I was probably using the
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.080]   Freedom Unlimited.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.200]   I actually offered to pay cash to a lot of vendors and asked them if there was a
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:22.920]   better deal.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.400]   And some vendors gave anywhere from 5% to 10% off.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.360]   And in that case, it was just a way better deal for me to use cash than it was to
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.480]   earn one or two points per dollar because 5% to 10% off is like an instant
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.200]   no-brainer.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.440]   And so I would say negotiate for a cash deal.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.360]   And if you can't get it, and by the way, if you don't have to pay a fee to pay by
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.720]   credit card, then I would consider signing up for a card and using these expenses to
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.800]   meet the minimum spend to get a huge bonus.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.120]   Or maybe, you know, depending on how expensive your wedding is, two or three
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.960]   huge bonuses.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.520]   Okay.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.160]   And if you're getting married, then you're probably already starting to think about
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.200]   how you might want to optimize points as a couple with your partner.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.720]   And this was the second most popular question.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.920]   Charlie, Brendan, Daniel all sent in asking about this.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.000]   And the big piece of it was, are you using separate cards or are you using
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.400]   authorized users or how do you do this with your partner?
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.640]   And so I'll say for all but one card, we just are authorized users on each other's
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.760]   cards when it makes sense and when it's free.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.480]   So my wife happens to be the Freedom Unlimited cardholder.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.120]   So I'm an authorized user there.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.480]   I have my Chase Freedom card.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.040]   She's an authorized user there.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.440]   I've got a Bonvoy card.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.360]   She's an authorized user and so on and so on.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.720]   The one exception to that rule is that we each have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.800]   And while to some people that might not make any sense, for us, it's the card we
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:54.240]   use the most, so we both want one and we wanted to have one card where the other
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.200]   person wouldn't log in and see the transactions each month.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.600]   So if we wanted to buy gifts for each other, we could kind of keep it a secret.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.920]   And if you take the annual fee and you subtract off all the travel credits, the
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.480]   Peloton credit, the DoorDash credit, and you consider the fact that if one of us
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.520]   were an authorized user on another person's card, they do charge $75.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:21.080]   For us, it ends up being worth spending a little bit extra to have two cards so that
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.600]   we each have at least one credit card that's totally our own, that we can put
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.120]   something on that the other person doesn't see.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.520]   It's often gifts.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.440]   It's often around the holidays, but that's the one exception to that rule.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.320]   One thing that was a follow-up question someone asked that I think is really
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.760]   important is if you make someone an authorized user on your card, let's say
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.960]   you've had the Chase Sapphire Preferred for a while and your partner has been on
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.800]   that card, that does not preclude them from getting a sign-up bonus.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.040]   So right now, they could very easily go sign up for the Sapphire Preferred and
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.800]   get that 100,000-point sign-up bonus right away.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.960]   I think that it's very important to consider that because I think one of the
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.440]   ways we've accumulated so many points is that I played the whole points game for a
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.160]   few years, and I was kind of bummed out because there weren't dozens of new cards
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.800]   each year.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.640]   And then I talked to my wife.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.200]   I said, "Hey, what if we do this on your side?"
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.040]   So then we just started opening up a lot of these same cards on her side, and we
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.680]   were just doubling up the bonuses.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.960]   So we've both had a Sapphire Preferred.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.560]   We've both had a Sapphire Reserve.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.480]   We've both had an Amex Platinum.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.280]   I think we've both had an Amex Gold, and that has allowed us to accumulate a lot
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:28.880]   of points.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.560]   And funny enough, we have most of those cards today.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.040]   We might not have two of them, but we've kept a lot of them, and we've been
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.280]   continuing to rack up points ever since.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.160]   When it comes to the authorized user thing, I will say, consider what the
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.640]   purpose of the card is and whether it even matters.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:49.320]   For us, the Amex Platinum is a great example where almost all of the spending
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.120]   goes on that card for flights.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.440]   And we don't buy flights in person, so we don't really need our own Amex Platinum.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.000]   Another perk of that card is that you get access to the Centurion Lounge at a lot of
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.040]   airports, but we don't travel independently enough to make it matter because you get a
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.880]   guest for free.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.320]   So we don't need to both have a Platinum card for that lounge.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.440]   So again, think about whether it even makes sense to get an authorized user if
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.880]   that's a card you use exclusively online.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.600]   We store all of our credit cards in one password.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.640]   We have a joint one-password account.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.920]   I'll talk a bit more about one-password at the end of this, but I can't say more
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.960]   about how much it's been helpful to be able to have all of our logins for all of
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.560]   our mileage accounts, all of our credit card numbers in one place where we can both
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.200]   access it.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.640]   And because we have all these cards, we have points in a lot of places.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.240]   So we do keep a spreadsheet to track all of it.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.760]   That includes where they are, whose they are, when they expire.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.720]   And while nobody asked this, I will point out that miles do expire with some
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.080]   programs. And if you want to make sure they don't expire, there's a few things you
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.440]   can do to keep them around.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.960]   If you have a flight or a hotel coming up, that's an easy one.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.840]   If you have that credit card, you can just spend money on it.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.600]   But let's say you happen to have a random old airline or hotel account where you
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.560]   don't have a credit card and there's nothing going in.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.320]   You could always just transfer some points there.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.200]   So if they're a Chase or an Amex partner, you could move some points over.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.080]   You could make a small redemption.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.800]   I don't know if this is as common anymore, but you used to be able to spend like
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.840]   100, 200 points to get a magazine subscription.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.960]   You could always just buy $10 or $20 worth of points to top up the balance.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.080]   Anytime that points balance changes, that almost always qualifies to extend the
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.320]   deadline. A few others are most rental car companies like Hertz or Avis will let you
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.840]   credit that rental to almost any airline.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.360]   So you could do that. Or almost any airline and hotel has a shopping portal.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.200]   And if you click through their portal, it's kind of like Ebates and Rakuten where you
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.560]   can make a purchase online and earn a few more points.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.240]   So that's what we do to make sure that all these points that are all over the place
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.600]   never expire. But yeah, that's our strategy as a couple.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:04.720]   So David wrote in asking, "Is it even worth dealing with points and miles if you only
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.960]   fly once or twice a year?" And I'll say it really depends on where you travel and what
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.720]   class you want to travel in and what kind of hotel you want to stay at when you get
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:19.120]   there. So I think points really come in to be valuable when you're staying in really
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.080]   luxurious hotels or when you're flying business class, when you're flying international
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:29.240]   or maybe even if you're flying domestic, but to obscure airports where there might only
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.760]   be a couple of flights a week.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.200]   So if none of those things apply or if the amount you spend on travel each year is only
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.600]   a few hundred dollars, then honestly, you might be better off just using the Citi Double
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.320]   Cash Card and getting 2% cash back and just using that cash to buy flights.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.520]   OK, so one of the hacks that I talked about before is that if you have a credit card that
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.200]   gives you a lot of points per dollar on grocery store purchases, you can actually buy
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.320]   gift cards at the grocery store to spend elsewhere.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.400]   And so David wrote in and asked, "Is there any downside to buying gift cards at the
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.800]   grocery store and specifically buying prepaid Visa gift cards?" I'd say there are two
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.480]   reasons this might not be as good as it sounds.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.440]   On the prepaid Visa card or Amex card, anything where it's not actually a specific
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.800]   retailer gift card, one of the reasons I don't like them is that you usually have to pay
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.720]   a fee. So if you get a $100 gift card and you got to pay a $4 activation fee, you might
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.920]   be getting a lot of points per dollar, but you're paying a 4% fee and chances are that
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.800]   doesn't make up for it.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.520]   So I typically won't use a credit card to earn points to buy a gift card if I have to
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.080]   pay a fee to get that gift card.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.280]   The other challenge with these prepaid cards is that it's sometimes tricky to get the
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.400]   balance down to zero.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.240]   And if you ultimately have a $100 card and you only spend it down to $4, that's just
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.240]   like having a 4% fee on the card.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.400]   And I don't love that.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.240]   And one of the reasons it's tricky to get the balance to zero is there's not that many
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.720]   retailers that will let you split purchases on multiple cards.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.960]   However, a restaurant is a great place to do this.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.120]   And there's one hack that I've learned along the way.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.000]   If you tell someone to put $100 on a card at a restaurant, but it's a prepaid card that
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.600]   only has a $100 balance, it often won't go through because the restaurant might
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.760]   preauthorize an amount greater than you tell them to leave room for the tip.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.280]   So what you can do is you can say for a $100 gift card, can you put $80 on this card and
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.440]   then tip $20 to get it to the full $100?
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.560]   When it comes to buying retailer gift cards, if it's already a retailer that I have a
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.640]   purchase in mind, let's say I need to spend a lot of money on something at Home Depot,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.600]   or I don't have a travel card and I want to buy some flights on Southwest, I think
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.880]   these are great opportunities to get a lot of points, assuming you earn a lot of
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.400]   points at the grocery store.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:54.800]   But the one caveat I'll give is that Visa, MasterCard, Amex all offer some amount of
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.280]   purchase protection with their cards.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.040]   And I've used this purchase protection for a few different things.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:05.160]   But oftentimes, if you buy something and it breaks or you lose it within the first 90
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.760]   days, they'll refund you up to a certain amount.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.000]   And so a great example was I bought an SD card and I immediately lost it a week later
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.480]   and I was able to get that completely refunded.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.600]   Warranty extension is another one.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.920]   And so sometimes if you buy something, it has a one year warranty.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.720]   The credit card company will actually give you an extra year warranty.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.680]   So if you buy an iPhone and it breaks in the second year, Visa or Amex might actually
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.160]   cover the cost of repair that second year, even though Apple won't.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   But when you buy gift cards, if the purchase wasn't on the original credit card, then
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.760]   you don't get a lot of those benefits.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:48.680]   So if I'm buying something on Amazon or anywhere and that purchase is of something
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:54.120]   that I think could break or might be easily lost or that I might need to repair, those
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.840]   are purchases that I often won't make with gift cards.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.640]   OK, and now for the big question that Steven, Brendan, Ryan, Michael all wrote in
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.400]   asking about, how do you redeem miles to get the maximum value?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:12.280]   So as much as I love the fact that the Chase and Amex travel portals make it really easy
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.480]   to use your miles, use your points to book travel, the way you get the really, really
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.760]   big values for your points is when you can book directly with airlines and hotels.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:28.040]   And to do that, you either earn points in those programs or you take Chase points or
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.680]   Amex points and you transfer them to those airline or hotel partners.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.440]   And don't forget, you're not limited to flying on just the transfer partners.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.440]   You can use miles with those partners to fly on their partner airlines.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.040]   So you could transfer Chase points to United and fly on any of the 26 different Star
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.480]   Alliance airlines like Lufthansa or Asiana or A&A, and you could transfer miles to
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.440]   British Airways and fly on any One World partner like Japan Airlines or Qantas.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.880]   And you could transfer Amex points to Delta and fly on Korean Air or Alitalia.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.320]   And that's how you get really, really outsized value from your miles.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.600]   And like I mentioned earlier, the biggest outsized value usually comes from flying
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:14.360]   business class, flying to obscure destinations, flying international, staying at
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.480]   luxury hotels or doing all.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.440]   If you're trying to take a long flight to an obscure destination in business class,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.520]   that can sometimes get you 10 cents per point or mile, which is really, really
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.200]   crazy compared to what it would cost otherwise in cash.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.760]   A great example of this is a flight that my neighbor Joe recently booked.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:39.720]   So he was looking to take his family of four to Europe and was trying to do it in
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.960]   business class, was sitting on a lot of miles and managed to find that if he
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:51.400]   transferred 440,000 miles from Chase to Air France, he was able to book four round
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.440]   trip business class tickets to Europe.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:00.160]   Now, those tickets would normally cost somewhere on the order of four or $5,000
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:06.360]   each, but if he had used 440,000 miles in the travel portal on Chase, he would have
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.960]   gotten one and a half cents per mile and he would have been able to book $6,600
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.760]   worth of flights, which wouldn't have even gotten him two tickets.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.200]   So he got crazy value.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.800]   So the question isn't really, how do you get the crazy value?
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.800]   It's clear that it's from luxury travel, luxury hotels, international trips.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.880]   The real challenge is how do you find the availability?
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.960]   And I'll give you three ways to do it.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:36.960]   There's a DIY approach, there's a premium paid search approach, and then there's
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.840]   paid award booking services that will do it all for you.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.760]   So you could do all this for free with a DIY approach, which basically involves
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.480]   going to the websites of all the airline partners and searching for
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.720]   the flights you want yourself.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.720]   So Chase has, you know, 10 different airline partners.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.240]   You could go to the United website and search for flights.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   You could then go to the Flying Blue website or the British Airways site.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   And the downside is that it's a lot of searching and the more flexible you are
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.120]   with dates, the more searching you have to do.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.560]   And depending on the airline, you might actually have to go in and create a
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.240]   mileage account with each airline you're searching, but it's a hundred percent
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:18.120]   free and it totally works and in general, I always say it's a great starting point.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.480]   If you have a bunch of Chase points, maybe just go to United's website
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.760]   and see if you find the flight.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.640]   If you have a bunch of Amex points, maybe it's Air Canada, maybe it's
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.120]   Delta and just search the sites just to get a quick glance, but if you don't see
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.320]   what you want at the very beginning, you might want to consider paid sites because
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.280]   they make the searching a lot easier.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:44.000]   So I used to always recommend JuicyMiles.com because it was easy and fantastic,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.920]   but it seems as of a few weeks ago, they're transitioning to a new brand,
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.640]   which is Point.me and while it does appear that they finally put the search on their
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.680]   site, I think it's still a little broken.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.440]   So maybe by the time you're listening to this, it's working.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.080]   I really hope it does because it's a fantastic product when it was working,
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.360]   but right now it's really hard to recommend because it doesn't work.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.040]   Another paid search site is ExpertFlyer.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.640]   It doesn't support every airline, but they do let you search plus or minus three
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.920]   days so you can search a little bit more and so you can go in and search by airline.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:24.240]   Or I think one of the best products with a couple caveats is KVS Availability Tool.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   Now you need a PC and you need to be comfortable using an interface that looks
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.400]   like it was made 10 or 20 years ago, but they support more airlines than anyone
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.960]   else and if you do have a Mac, you can use it with an emulator like VirtualBox,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.920]   but it definitely has a learning curve.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.360]   So I wouldn't recommend it if you don't want to go deep down the rabbit hole.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.120]   And I really hope for your sake that the Juicy Miles to Point.me transition is
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.680]   made by the time you need it because it's just such an easier product to use.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.320]   One thing to keep in mind with any of these searches, whether you're doing it
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.640]   manually on the airline websites or using a tool, is that you're only going to find
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.280]   availability when it exists for your entire trip.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.720]   So I'd say it's worth looking for flights to major cities and buying a paid
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.480]   ticket for a short flight at the end.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:15.000]   So for example, we recently tried to go to Santorini in Greece and there
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.160]   was basically no availability, but we looked for flights round trip to Athens
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.360]   and got them in business class with points and then we just bought a $50
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.120]   30 minute flight to get to the island.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.560]   So if you're flying to Thailand on an island, maybe you just search for flights
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.760]   to Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur or Singapore instead, or if you're going somewhere in
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.280]   Europe, maybe search for London, Paris, or Frankfurt if you don't find your
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.800]   original destination right away.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.200]   This is also true for departing cities.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.120]   So I live right near SFO and while my preference is always to fly directly
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.440]   from here, one time we wanted to go to Tokyo and there just wasn't anything.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.560]   So we took two business class flights from LA and we just bought a cheap $75
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.520]   ticket to LA and flew direct from there in an amazing lie-flat business seat on
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.920]   ANA, which by the way is fantastic.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.960]   Finally, if all of this sounds like a lot of work, but you're sitting on lots
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.440]   of points and want to take an epic trip, there are award booking services, which
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.480]   are basically like paying someone like me, but better, who has access to all
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.640]   these tools and knows the ins and outs of everything, promotions, what's going
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.160]   on right now, who's got the right availability, and they will go and find
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:31.280]   all of your travel for you, depending on which site you use, they can cost
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.640]   anywhere from $100 to $200 a person.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.920]   Some of them just charge a fee to get started and if they don't find you
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.200]   anything, they don't actually end up charging you.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.480]   I know that Juicy Miles ran a service like this and now Point.me
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.200]   has their full service concierge.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.720]   I've heard great things about it, so check that out.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.960]   Or if you just search award booking service online, you'll find
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.840]   dozens of companies that do this.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.400]   Hey everybody, I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point.me,
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.200]   my favorite award search tool, to give you a special offer of only $1 for your
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:09.280]   first month of their standard plan, if you go to allthehacks.com/pointme and
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.880]   use the promo code HACKS.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:18.320]   Again, allthehacks.com/P-O-I-N-T-M-E, or find the link in the show notes.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.720]   So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with Points.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.520]   So that's all flights.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.480]   We didn't talk at all about hotels and that's because they're a little easier.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.520]   If you already have hotel points with a specific program, then great.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.360]   Just search on their website and there really isn't much more to do.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.880]   And while Chase and Amex each have hotel partners, other than transferring
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.000]   Chase points to Hyatt, I don't think you should waste your time.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.400]   That said, I think some of the best points redemptions I've ever
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.960]   had are booking through Hyatt.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   For Christmas in 2019, we stayed at the Park Hyatt Kyoto.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.800]   It was a 30,000 points a night, which probably would have gotten me four or
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.760]   $500 booking through the portal, but that room was almost $1,300.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.880]   So it was a fantastic redemption.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:09.840]   If you do really want to take epic trips to hotels and for whatever reason, Chase
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.720]   Points or Hyatt is not interesting, the way you're going to want to do it is to
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.640]   get a credit card with a hotel chain.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:21.480]   And the reason why is that so many of the transferable points, Chase, City,
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:28.320]   Amex, they transfer one-to-one, but for almost all hotel chains, except Hyatt,
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.760]   the value of hotel points is about half to a third the value of airline points.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.960]   So you're just always going to get a better deal transferring your
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.120]   Chase or Amex points to airlines.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.960]   That said, credit cards for hotel companies have much higher earnings.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.320]   So if you want to earn hotel points, you're better off getting a hotel
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.600]   card that earns five, six, maybe even seven points per dollar on different
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   categories and really helps you rack up points on a hotel program like
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.360]   Marriott's Bonvoy or Hilton Honors.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.800]   Okay.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   I know that was a lot, but so many of you asked that question.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.040]   So hopefully that was helpful.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.200]   If I missed anything, please reach out.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.680]   I'm happy to help clarify.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.320]   I probably should just write a big guide to this and I probably will at some point,
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.360]   but for now, I hope that helps.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.920]   So there's still a bunch of other questions people wrote in.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.120]   I'm going to start next with investing because we got a lot of questions there.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.880]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.600]   is actually so good for you.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.360]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.000]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.240]   ways to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.720]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:48.760]   leaves from 250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.680]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.920]   minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:01.080]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:06.400]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.160]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.560]   the green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh, which
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:19.360]   helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.320]   good and probably one of my favorite things to drink, and if you need another
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.960]   reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits of polyphenols
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.120]   for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.320]   Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.840]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.600]   offers free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:48.240]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free Quiver with 12
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.480]   tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:00.080]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:06.880]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.040]   great addition to your new year routine, and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.760]   with them today.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.840]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.280]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.560]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.960]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.600]   for coffee.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.560]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade, sign up for a
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.600]   subscription, or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.000]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.480]   it, and over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.280]   this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.160]   Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.680]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.160]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.240]   visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.800]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.360]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.760]   Before we get back to the episode, I just want to thank you for listening
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.120]   to and supporting the show.

[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:40.320]   So Josh wrote in and asked what type of setup I have for my 529, and Swarupa wrote
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.720]   in asking about investments and planning for kids coming into the world.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.000]   So I'll just share a little bit about what I do.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.640]   So I set up a 529 at Wealthfront, and at first glance, I thought, even as an
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:57.560]   employee, do I really want to pay a fee for my 529 given that tax benefits of the
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:02.880]   automation aren't as relevant when you have tax-free gains like you do in a 529?
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:08.800]   Ultimately, I did some research and I came to the conclusion that most 529s that you
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.840]   sign up for online don't have as much opportunity for diversification as
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.680]   Wealthfront offered.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.480]   And so for me, the extra risk-adjusted return I thought I would get from that
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.240]   diversification made up for the fee.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.520]   And so that's what I went ahead and did.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.240]   Now, last week, I talked to Andy Ratcliffe, and he brought up a really
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.600]   important point about liquidity.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:35.080]   I would say one thing to consider is that when you put money in a 529, that money
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.360]   needs to be used for educational expenses.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.520]   Now, the good news is it doesn't just have to be college.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.720]   It could be for private school.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.440]   And if you don't end up needing it for your children, you could pass it on to
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.720]   their children, and there are even some circumstances where you might be able to
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.920]   withdraw it if your children get scholarships.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.200]   But I will say you can't use it to buy a home.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.160]   You can't use it to pay for medical expenses.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.840]   So do make sure you have enough liquidity outside of a 529 to be able to cover
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.240]   things like that that might come up.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.360]   And realize that the value of not having to borrow or pay fees if you do need that
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.720]   money is probably going to be greater than the tax advantage you'll get from a 529.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.000]   So as for trying to predict how much you need to contribute, there are lots of
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.480]   tools online, we've built one at Wealthfront where you can go in and pick
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.800]   whether it's a state school or a private school and kind of get a sense of what
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.360]   that's expected to cost and how much you need to contribute and then just start
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.440]   making contributions.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.920]   One other financial thing when it comes to planning for kids is making sure you
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.960]   have the right insurance plan.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.000]   So when you're young and healthy, it might have made a lot of sense to get a
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.120]   high deductible health plan with an HSA and contribute each year because you
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.320]   weren't going to the doctor that often.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.120]   But it turns out if you haven't looked up, having a baby is quite expensive.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.040]   And if you're using a high deductible health plan, it's very likely that you
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.640]   will go through that entire deductible and it will probably not have been your
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.840]   best choice that year if you had access to a PPO or an EPO.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.000]   One of my favorite plans, assuming all of the doctors and facilities you want to
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.120]   use are in-network, is an EPO.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.920]   Usually it's the cheapest cost for you if you're in-network, but the downside is
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.160]   you can't go out of network.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.000]   I was fortunate that the EPO my company offered had all the facilities we wanted
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.560]   it to go to in-network, and so I signed up for that and my wife had an EPO through
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:27.800]   her plan, and the entire cost of pregnancy and childbirth was less than $500.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:33.160]   Another question that I get a lot, and specifically this time from Josh, is how
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.080]   do you think about allocating to alternative strategies?
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:42.440]   This could include things like crypto, wine, art, angel investing, etc.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.080]   The way I think about it in general is that I keep a small amount of my portfolio
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.920]   on things that are exciting, things that are fun, things that I think I might have
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   an edge on, but at the end of the day, I keep the vast majority, 90 plus percent,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.640]   in a long-term, diverse, passive investment strategy.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:06.080]   And so as my net worth has grown, that kind of small less than 10% piece has
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.400]   gotten big enough that I've been able to do some extra things.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.920]   So some of that was buying some Bitcoin.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.640]   I've invested in a few companies I was really interested in, and I've made a few
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.360]   other small investments in projects I was excited by, but at the end of the day, I
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.720]   haven't actually really purchased a lot of alternatives.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.280]   I haven't gone and purchased any fractional art or any wine other than the
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.160]   wine I buy to drink, but if you want to dive a little deeper, definitely check out
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.600]   the episode I did with Andy Ratcliffe, or keep an eye out for an upcoming episode of
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.800]   the Modern Finance Podcast, where I talk about how much to consider allocating in
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.520]   your portfolio to cryptocurrency.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.800]   Finally, Jeremiah asked me, "How can I send money into an account and
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.000]   automatically invest it?"
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.080]   Now, this is a fantastic question because it's just something that seems so broken.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.560]   There are so few brokerage firms that will allow you to do any kind of recurring
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.200]   purchases, and almost none that will let you do it with a portfolio.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.560]   Instead, you're forced to deposit money and set up a trade every time you want to
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.200]   make an individual investment.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.200]   So, I might sound like a broken record, but I use WealthRent for this.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.960]   In fact, when I joined, I spent the first 18 months working on building automated
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:22.160]   investing so that you could say, "I want to deposit money, and I want it to
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.840]   automatically go here and do this," which could mean keep a certain amount in cash,
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:32.800]   then transfer $200 a month into my IRA, and then invest the rest in a portfolio
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   that looks like this.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.000]   And you can customize that portfolio to whatever types of investments you want.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.280]   I do think there are probably a few other brokerage firms that allow this.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.400]   I know that Vanguard allows you to set up direct deposit, but you still have to set
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.600]   up the individual trades.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.960]   I also believe that Robinhood lets you make recurring purchases, but you have to
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.440]   set it up for each individual security or index fund.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.920]   So, I really think this is one of the things that RoboAdvisors and WealthRent
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.120]   specifically have put together to make this really easy.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.600]   So, if that's interesting, definitely check it out.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.480]   And last episode, Andy shared that if you go to wealthrent.com/andy, you can get
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.320]   your first $5,000 managed for free.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.920]   All right, that's it with investing.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.800]   I want to jump into the different tools and services I use to optimize everything I do.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   And Josh wrote in specifically asking about financial and investment tools, so
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.520]   I'll start there.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:28.640]   When it comes to tracking my points, my budget, spending, net worth, there's
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.960]   really three tools I use.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.720]   I track all my points, and I create a budget in Google Sheets.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.120]   It's as simple as that.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:41.040]   I do use Mint to sync all of my transactions from all of my credit cards so I can try to
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.080]   get a good sense of how much I'm spending each month.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.400]   I don't love Mint, but it's free.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:51.280]   Although I have heard really fantastic things about Copilot, Jesse from YNAB really
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.440]   lured me in that direction.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.720]   And Tiller is a really cool product that lets you sync data into Google Sheets.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.440]   But at the end of the day, I think Mint being free works for this very specific
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.520]   purpose well, and I'll be honest, I oftentimes just export all the data out of Mint and
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.080]   just bring it right into another spreadsheet.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.720]   And then finally, I use Wealthfront for tracking my net worth.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.200]   I sync all of my accounts there, and I can just see how it's going.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.400]   I can use that for planning for the future.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.560]   I go in and say, "This is how much I'm going to save each month," and I can project my
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.480]   net worth, slide around my retirement age, and all that.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:30.520]   When it comes to insurance, I am not loyal to any particular insurance company.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:37.480]   In fact, we use Geico for car, we use Lemonade for our home, we use Travelers for my
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.560]   wife's engagement ring.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.880]   So honestly, every year or so, I just go on, I do some quick searching on different
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.720]   providers to see if one is cheaper, and I'm happy to switch at any point in time.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:53.160]   Taxes, up until a few years ago, I used TurboTax for everything.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:58.040]   And then it just got to a point in life where the different types of investments, the
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.080]   different businesses, everything was just enough that I was done doing it myself.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.560]   And I used a firm called Anderson.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.760]   It's not cheap.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.920]   But if you are in a situation where your taxes are complicated enough that you want to
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.880]   spend a few thousand dollars a year at minimum, definitely encourage you to check them
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.200]   out or email me, and I'm happy to make an introduction.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.640]   Once we had a child, we really started to think about estate planning, trusts, wills.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:26.520]   One hack here is that some big employers offer a legal benefit where you can pay a
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:31.240]   small amount of money each month, and it gives you access to free legal services.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:36.400]   So our first estate plan and will and trust and health care directives and all that good
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.560]   stuff, we set up with a lawyer through the legal program that Google had.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.560]   Recently, after having a child, we decided to update everything.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.320]   And I went ahead and set everything up with Trust & Will.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.280]   I got a chance to meet the founders of Trust & Will.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.720]   I thought they were fantastic.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.840]   I'm not an investor.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.880]   I'm not an advisor.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.840]   I'm not a shareholder.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.400]   But I just think the product's great.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.520]   And if you want to get 15% off, I emailed the founder, Cody.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.360]   He set me up with a promo code, allthehacks.com/trustandwill, and you'll get
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.840]   15% off when you sign up.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.320]   And I'll put a link to that in the show notes.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:11.360]   Finally, when it comes to brokerage, it's probably no surprise that almost all of my
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.560]   investments are at Wealthfront.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:18.720]   So I use that for my taxable brokerage, my 529, my Roth IRA.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.440]   I have 401(k)s wherever they are.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.920]   Wealthfront happens to be at Vanguard.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:28.320]   And if I do trade any individual stocks, I do that at Interactive Brokers.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.760]   I would not recommend Interactive Brokers to most people.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:36.560]   I would much prefer or recommend something like Schwab or Vanguard.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:42.040]   But the reason I love Interactive Brokers is that they do offer the ability to
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:47.160]   borrow against your stock positions for, right now, I think it's 0.75%.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.680]   So there have been a couple of times where I've wanted to do that.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.800]   And that rate makes it worth the fact that they have one of the worst user interfaces
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.120]   I've seen in my entire life.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.320]   Finally, one other one, HSAs.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.200]   I do have an HSA from a few years ago.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.840]   And one thing I didn't realize until recently is that you can actually transfer your HSA
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.760]   to a new provider.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:13.640]   And many of the HSAs that I've seen or that I've personally had through my employer are
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.760]   terrible and ridden with so many fees.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.360]   I love this startup called Lively.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.240]   I transferred my HSA there.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.680]   They set you up with a Fidelity account.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.000]   You can invest your HSA however you want.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.080]   And again, I have no affiliation with this company other than I think they have a
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.040]   fantastic product.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.120]   So I moved my HSA over to Lively.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:36.280]   I think that covers all of the kind of investing and financial things.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.840]   But I got an email from John asking how I use an app called Alfred.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.400]   And instead of diving into that right away, I thought I'd just give a high-level
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.920]   overview of the types of apps and software I use to make everything more efficient.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.960]   So the biggest thing that I think I couldn't live without is Gmail keyboard shortcuts.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.160]   If you haven't turned those on, I don't even know how I would operate without being
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.760]   able to fly through my inbox without shortcuts.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.920]   They aren't the most intuitive shortcuts, but I promise that as soon as you figure it
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.720]   out, it'll make email so much faster.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.040]   For storing stuff, I just use Google Drive and Dropbox.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.480]   For some reason, I have both of them.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.240]   I'm not really sure.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.760]   I've decided to use one of them for kind of podcasts and all that stuff and Google Drive
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.600]   for everything else.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.920]   On my Mac, I use an app called Alfred, and it's probably the most important app I
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.560]   have. It replaces the spotlight search when you press command spacebar.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.520]   I use that to find any file on my computer.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.120]   I use that to look for contact information.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:39.600]   I use it for snippets where I can create a shortcut for longer pieces of text like a
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.360]   known traveler number or an address.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:46.240]   And I can just type in a couple of letters and automatically expand that to what I
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:53.280]   want. I actually use that for emojis so I can spell out an emoji like S space.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.360]   Thumbs up will immediately give the thumbs up emoji so I can use those faster.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.160]   I use it to do calculations.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:04.560]   It actually stores your clipboard so I can search things that I've copied and pasted
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.240]   days or even weeks ago.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.760]   And then finally, I use it for custom web search.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:15.640]   So things like Google Drive, I have it set up so I can really quickly just type in, you
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.080]   know, like S G and then just search Google Drive straight from there.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.960]   It'll pull up a website and search Google Drive.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.440]   So Alfred is a fantastic product.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.960]   I gladly pay for it myself and I use it probably a hundred times a day.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.760]   Another app I use a lot is called Rectangle.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.640]   I used to use an app called Spectacle.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.200]   I actually think I have one on each computer, but I love that Rectangle is open
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.040]   source. And really, all it lets you do is very quickly and easily with keyboard
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.800]   shortcuts, move things around your screen.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:49.120]   So it'll let you quickly take one window and jump into the right half of your screen
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.600]   and then take the other window and you can jump into the left half or the top and
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.680]   bottom halves just to kind of manipulate things and move them around quickly.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.840]   And 1Password is a fantastic piece of software.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.440]   I use it every day.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.080]   We have a family plan that my wife and my parents are on.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.760]   I store credit cards, passports, logins for every website.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.640]   I use it to create a unique login for every website so that I don't have any passwords
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.680]   that are duplicated.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.800]   I store a lot of two-factor codes in there instead of Google Authenticator.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.560]   It's great because you can access those codes from your computer or your phone.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.400]   I'm a huge fan of 1Password.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.000]   I've been paying for it since 2013.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:33.080]   And if you go to allthehacks.com/1password, you can try for free for 14 days.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.400]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:39.440]   All right, Notion is another piece of software I use a ton.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:43.280]   It's a web app, but I use it all the time to organize my thoughts.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:47.720]   We have a whole Notion setup for our home and, you know, just keeping track of everything
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.880]   there, our child care schedule.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.560]   I use another Notion doc for our podcast.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.320]   So where Google Docs, everything is a doc and you have to link to another doc.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.800]   This has a bunch of hierarchy.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.400]   And so I use it to organize thoughts on so much.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.640]   Another new one is an app called BlueStacks.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.800]   It's a Android emulator for the Mac.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.600]   And I don't really do any Android development.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:15.360]   But why I think it's fantastic is there's always a handful of mobile apps that just
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.680]   don't have a website, don't have a web version.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.320]   And a great example of that is our baby monitor.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.600]   We use an app called Nanit, and there's not a way to access the camera from your
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.720]   computer. But when I'm working, sometimes I want to check and keep an eye on our
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.560]   daughter. And so I just pull up BlueStacks and I'm able to do that there.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.520]   So it's a free piece of software that basically gives you access to everything on
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.880]   Android on your computer.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.480]   So I think that's the core of the apps I use on a day to day basis that really help
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.200]   me be much more efficient with my life.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.440]   I think that wraps up this listener Q&A episode.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:53.080]   I hope there was a lot of information that was helpful and there will be links to
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.880]   everything we discussed in the show notes.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.800]   If you were one of the people that wrote in, hopefully you got a great answer to your
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.600]   question. If you have other questions, please feel free to reach out.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:05.080]   Chris@allthehacks.com, ask away.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.320]   We'll do this again and I'll try to get to as many questions as possible or I'll
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.520]   respond to you on email.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.040]   This was a lot of fun for me.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.920]   I really enjoy hearing from you guys.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.560]   So please keep that up.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.720]   Finally, I'll just say it again.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.280]   If you haven't signed up for the All The Hacks newsletter, that is going to be the
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:24.880]   primary way outside of this podcast that I communicate, send hacks and give updates.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.160]   So please head over to allthehacks.com/email and you can sign up and I will get that
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.320]   next issue out shortly.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.080]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.160]   I really appreciate it.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.280]   We'll be back with a guest next week.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:35.680]   See you then.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:51.920]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.680]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.840]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.720]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.800]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:10.080]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:14.400]   world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.120]   entertaining.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.640]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.760]   to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:29.720]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.360]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:35.000]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.960]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:41.720]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.200]   your money and grow your wealth.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.360]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.720]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.160]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
