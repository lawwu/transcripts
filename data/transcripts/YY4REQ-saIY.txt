[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   I would give up my life for the country.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.540]   In order to pull this thing off, we have to do it together, okay?
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.640]   We cannot do it with one side fighting the other side with irreconcilable differences.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.380]   The amount of debt that we're in, it represents a challenge, but it is not inevitable.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.160]   What is needed is, first of all, a strong middle to bring the country together, and
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.800]   then there needs to be a good engineering exercise that's going to produce, but has
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.800]   to be bipartisan.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.880]   A great reformation, much like the Manhattan Project, in which those bipartisan people
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.920]   get together and properly engineer important changes that need to be made.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.320]   They have to be structural.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.960]   I think my best role is to pass along whatever helpful thoughts I have, and then it's up
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.960]   to the people.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.960]   [MUSIC]
