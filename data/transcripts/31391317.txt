[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.960]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.640]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.960]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.160]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.560]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.640]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.760]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.600]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.000]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.360]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.720]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.340]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.280]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.820]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.560]   Well, listeners, I'm super glad
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.120]   to welcome you to today's episode.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.560]   Last time we were together, or a couple of times ago,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   we enjoyed hearing from Kelly Wilt and Alyse DeYoung
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.780]   about their experiences working with Memory Master
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.840]   and National Memory Master.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.440]   And we had so much fun,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.360]   and there was so much to share
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.000]   that we really didn't get finished.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.340]   And they had more to share,
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.760]   and there's more for you to learn.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.240]   And I also asked them to come back
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.760]   so that we could just share tips and tricks
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.840]   for memorizing for all of us.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.240]   For all of us, no matter how old we are
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.880]   or how old our students are,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.280]   tips and tricks for families all about memorizing.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.700]   So you just sit back or keep running
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.800]   or whatever you do when you're listening to a podcast,
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.880]   and we're gonna talk to you about memorizing tips and tricks
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.720]   for all kinds of families.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.140]   So Kelly, Alyse, I'm so excited
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.080]   that you were able to join me again today.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.040]   - Absolutely, Lisa, hooray.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.120]   We get to talk more about some of the things
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.680]   that we love memorizing
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.360]   and just how memory is such a gift from God
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.920]   and how we see that gift reflected
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.180]   in the lives of our foundation students
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.960]   and even most recently,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.520]   our National Memory Master finalists.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.040]   So I have heard reports of thousands of memory masters
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.880]   all around the world this cycle,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.080]   and it just thrills me to my fingertips
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.340]   and the tips of my toes to hear families delighting
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.960]   in the act of memory.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.920]   And most recently, Alyse and I both
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.520]   were at the National Memory Master Competition,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.140]   and I know Alyse has got some highlights
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.440]   from this year's competition to share.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.680]   - I am so glad, Alyse, thank you.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.440]   Are you super excited to be coming on to the team
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.880]   for National Memory Master?
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.800]   - Super excited is an understatement at this point,
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.480]   especially after having seen the competition
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.160]   and seen these memory masters in action.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.140]   It just blew me away at every turn,
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.680]   whether we threw curve balls at them with the timeline
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.920]   or the memory bee or the map drawing,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.240]   they really rose to the challenge
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.080]   and had worked so hard to get to that point,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.040]   and I just loved every second of it.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.360]   - Oh, I'm so glad.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   I will say that it is kind of an electric atmosphere.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.560]   I think by the time the students get to that point,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.840]   by the time that you have the finalists
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.320]   that are there at the National Memory Master Competition,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.960]   they are having a ball.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   They have, in essence, done the quote-unquote hard work,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.060]   and they are there to enjoy it.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.080]   And it is so much fun to me to see the interactions
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.280]   between the students and some between the families as well
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.920]   and the camaraderie that develops
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.640]   all around their common experience of memorizing.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.360]   And honestly, and I think we'll probably stumble
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.720]   upon some of those gems during our time together
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.520]   this afternoon, I think that the act of memorizing
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.080]   and the shared memory of common information
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.160]   builds community wherever you practice it,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.360]   even in your family.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.040]   And that's what I want all our CC families and beyond
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   to get, that there is beauty in memorizing with your family
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.640]   that somehow will knit your hearts together
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.840]   in an even deeper way.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.940]   So we're gonna talk about it.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.960]   We're gonna talk about it. - Absolutely.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.800]   Well, and Lisa, I would say this.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.880]   Just in my interactions with the families
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.680]   at National Memory Master,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.600]   I would say I have never once heard a parent say,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.000]   "Oh, my child did this all by themselves."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.640]   Yes, never once.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.620]   And so to hear these moms and dads and siblings saying,
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.480]   "Oh, yeah, we sit down and we do this every day,"
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.120]   or "Our favorite thing that we memorize together is this,"
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.440]   or "Here's this fun thing that we did,"
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.720]   to learn the timeline events frontwards and backwards,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.600]   it's such a joy to see these families celebrating together.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.480]   And that is one of the key words
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.600]   of the National Memory Master competition.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.280]   We celebrate.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.400]   We celebrate these acts of memory.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.520]   We celebrate the finalists,
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.720]   but we also celebrate the sacrifice
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.400]   that these families have made to come together
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.480]   and to participate in these acts of memory,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.640]   building libraries of the mind,
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.800]   common libraries of the mind together.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.160]   It really is a beautiful thing.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.600]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.760]   And that comes through in the leadership
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.960]   that you two provide to our family.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.720]   So we've just been talking about it,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.940]   and we have just been through the season
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.640]   of Memory Master testing with all our foundations families
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.400]   all over the world.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.520]   And as y'all have been discussing,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.000]   the inspiring National Memory Master competition
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.040]   and celebration.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.400]   So, and I know that y'all have been deeply involved
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.240]   in these.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.880]   So I wanna give you a chance to brag on this year.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.240]   So tell me, Elise, tell me some of the highlights
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.160]   of this year's National Memory Master competition.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.680]   - There are so many that I could share with you all,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.340]   but I definitely do have one that stands out in my mind.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.920]   So during the competition, I got to sit in the back row
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.840]   and kind of oversee the competition,
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.240]   which means I just got to see all the parents and siblings
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.140]   and the competitors all at once.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.160]   And one of my favorite things was to see how the crowd
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.320]   reacted to these amazing students.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   There were applause and celebration when they succeeded.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.360]   And when they did not succeed,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.540]   there was always a standing ovation for these kids
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.500]   every single time.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.700]   And they were just, they were welcomed into the arms
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.060]   of their parents if they were upset or anything.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.100]   And I will be honest, I'm not a big crier,
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.540]   but I was sitting in the back row getting very emotional
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.060]   watching this competition, because you just,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.780]   you know that there's so much invested time
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.020]   that these families have put towards this competition
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.640]   and their hearts are in it and they love it.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.220]   And so it was so exciting to see how this competition
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.300]   wasn't how you might imagine, like, oh,
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.060]   you've been eliminated, go sit down and then just like
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.900]   silence as you watch them descend from the stage.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.380]   It was a team effort.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.480]   Everyone was proud of these students,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.420]   whether they had known them prior to the competition or not.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.940]   And I got to see that all at once from the back seat
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.220]   and it was encouraging and exciting to witness.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.400]   - That is so awesome to hear and see
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.120]   that it really is a family.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.760]   It's a family endeavor.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.540]   So yes, your little nuclear family has helped you learn
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.120]   to memorize and recite and make up a story and draw a map
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.280]   and do fast math, all of that.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   But then the larger CC family is a community of support.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.040]   I love that so much.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.060]   I love that.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.340]   Kelly, what are some of your highlights from this year?
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.580]   - Oh my goodness, I think if it were up to me,
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.460]   I would want all of them to win.
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.020]   And so it is a blessing that I am not the head judge.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:44.020]   And I just, from the moment that the families arrive
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.660]   at the venue for the competition,
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.320]   you can sense the togetherness,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.440]   the togetherness of each family,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.320]   which then becomes extended as families are introduced
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.140]   to one another and we become a family of families
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.560]   right there in real time at the competition.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.380]   And I've got to say two of my favorite highlights
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.780]   from this year.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.380]   One was during some of our more difficult timeline heats.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.980]   Elise and I both noted that the students
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.300]   who were not currently answering the question
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.960]   were seated in their chairs
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.260]   and you could see them counting on their fingers
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.560]   and in their minds, these were timeline events.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.600]   And before the head judge could give a thumbs up,
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.680]   you know, that was the correct answer
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.040]   or a thumbs down for an incorrect answer,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.520]   you could see the sheer joy spread across
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.640]   these finalists' faces when they realized
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.920]   that their friend had answered correctly.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.360]   And that was such a delight to see.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.120]   It just thrilled my heart to see them cheering
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.340]   on their friends, doing these difficult things.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.100]   And I think my second highlight was, you know,
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.380]   at the end of round two,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.500]   which this year we had five finalists move forward
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.340]   into round two.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.300]   - Right, that's unusual, right?
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.300]   - Yes, typically it's only four finalists.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.620]   And this year the students were just so outstanding
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.180]   that eventually the judges said,
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.900]   "All right, we're just going to move on."
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.420]   (all laughing)
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.160]   "We're going to end this portion of the competition
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.000]   "so you're all going ahead."
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.080]   - Yes, when the winner's name was announced,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.720]   one of the other finalists just reached over
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.800]   and he just engulfed him in this huge hug.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.560]   And they were celebrating and jumping up and down
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.760]   and cheering for their friend.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.720]   And it was just so wonderful to see the highlights
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.840]   of the competition centered around these relationships
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.200]   that these students had built with one another,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.700]   that the families had built with one another.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.900]   National Memory Master Competition
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.140]   is always a time of sheer joy as we celebrate together.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.940]   - That, and see that kind of, I will admit,
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.300]   that brought me to tears and it's just you
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.780]   telling about something that happened weeks ago.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.100]   But I love, I love the fact
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.100]   that we are celebrating one another.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.640]   We're not celebrating how smart somebody is.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   We're not celebrating the eliteness of the accomplishment.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.180]   We are celebrating our friend.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.060]   We're celebrating our family.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.260]   We're celebrating your accomplishment,
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.980]   but we are sharing your joy.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.140]   That is just awesome to me.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.340]   And I want people to hear that,
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.940]   that yes, it's a competition
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.060]   because you are winnowing people down
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.780]   'til you get a winner,
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.660]   but it's not as much about the competition
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.300]   as it is about celebration of the efforts.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.540]   So that's great, that's great.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.380]   It really is.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.700]   I know that I can tell that you guys love spending time
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.280]   with those families that have chosen to participate.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.660]   And it really does sound like a family affair.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.980]   What I want to know is,
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.600]   are there common characteristics
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.500]   that you've noticed in these families?
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.420]   I think that there are three words
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.860]   that immediately come to mind
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.220]   that really describe all 16 families,
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.860]   and that would be dedicated, enthusiastic, and united.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.980]   All of these families have poured so much time and effort
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.800]   into this memory work, into the preparation,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.780]   into traveling all the way
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.500]   to be there for the competition.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.740]   And in their dedication, they are so excited about it.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.260]   You can see it on their faces.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.060]   I remember meeting everyone in person
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.900]   for the first time at check-in,
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.580]   and just those kids, they were wide-eyed looking around,
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.420]   like you're seeing your friends in person
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.660]   for the first time who you've met over Zoom or messaging.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.300]   And they were just so excited to be there.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.680]   And then finally, as a family unit,
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.260]   they were all united around this one goal
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.420]   and this one celebration.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.500]   And it was definitely so exciting to see
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.200]   because I loved what you said at the beginning
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.260]   about there's a common thread because of the memory work.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.320]   It really does bind everyone together.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.700]   And I think that's really important,
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.260]   and it definitely played itself out this year.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.220]   What about you, Kelly?
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.840]   How would you characterize them?
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.780]   - I love the words that Alyse chose,
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.180]   and I think they are so accurate.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.980]   There is a spirit of unity
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.540]   between the members of the family with their students
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.740]   from the moment they arrive.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.200]   You can tell that this is something
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.140]   that they have done together,
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.060]   and they are enthusiastic.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.620]   There are no sad faces.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.340]   No one looks as if,
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.020]   mom told me that I can never play outside again if I-
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.860]   - Right, right.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.700]   (all laughing)
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.980]   - There's nothing like that.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.820]   They are just supremely enthusiastic
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.020]   about what they have accomplished,
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.420]   and not in a prideful way, but in a,
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.380]   hey, we did something difficult,
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.060]   but we did it together, and we're excited.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.500]   I think that those characteristics
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.500]   really are helpful for our families
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.540]   to achieve that success in memory together,
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.780]   and one of the things that we prayed this year
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.660]   at the competition was that these acts of memory
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.820]   would be a love offering to the Lord,
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.580]   because it's one thing to do something difficult
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.140]   for your own honor and glory,
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.460]   which is very temporal, not long-lasting,
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.620]   but to do something and offer it as
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.420]   a love offering to the Lord
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.220]   is an entirely different thing,
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.460]   and I think having that perspective
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.900]   regarding memorizing foundations of memory work,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.180]   drawing maps of the world, or whatever we do,
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.860]   as Christians, that puts every single task
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.820]   that we complete in a different perspective
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.460]   and in a different light,
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.940]   and I think that these families have done that.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.700]   They have prioritized rightly.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.900]   They have done this together,
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.140]   and they're so excited to share the fruits
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.780]   of what God has done in their families
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.220]   through memorizing the foundation's memory work.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.300]   It's always such a beautiful thing to see
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.980]   families getting together and praying
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.380]   before the competition and just encouraging their students.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.660]   You can tell that they are supremely invested
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.260]   not only in the fact that their student
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.500]   has memorized these facts, but that in the memorizing
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.140]   that this has changed their child for eternity,
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.500]   and I think that perspective is key
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.660]   for not only the National Memory Master Competition,
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.660]   but for foundations families as well,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.860]   whether your child memory masters every single cycle
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.660]   and has done it since they were four years old,
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.620]   or whether or not your child just loves the timeline song
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.700]   and they just want to sing the timeline song
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.540]   in memory every year.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.980]   If that's the one thing that they delight in,
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.020]   that it is a love offering to the Lord.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.260]   And what a wonderful thing that is.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.540]   - I think that's great.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:33.540]   And you both have made such a point of the fact
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.580]   that this is a family affair
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.740]   and that parents are very invested
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   or very much a part of the National Memory Master journey.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.860]   So I want to know, can you give me some specifics?
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.260]   How involved do most parents get
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.660]   in their child's preparation?
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   I mean, how much time does it take?
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:01.180]   What have you heard about other family members helping out?
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.140]   - Well, I think one thing when you consider
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.540]   the achievement of these families
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.820]   that are coming to National Memory Master,
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.620]   the best metaphor I can think of is watering,
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:16.100]   slow watering a garden over a long period of time.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.380]   Because I am from the South
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.820]   and I grew up with a grandfather
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.780]   who always had a summer garden.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.300]   And so every day he would just lightly,
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.180]   slowly water his garden.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.700]   He didn't want to wash the seeds away.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.820]   And this deep irrigation would sink into the roots
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.180]   of those baby roots of those plants
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.540]   and anchor them in the soil.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.100]   And National Memory Master
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.540]   and even Memory Master in community
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.460]   is definitely not something that you wake up and go,
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.860]   I think I'm going to do National Memory Master.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.700]   - Yes, yes.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.180]   I mean, maybe some people do,
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.580]   but that's probably not the recipe for success.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.980]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.180]   Elias, I'm trying to remember.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.980]   I think we had at least one finalist this year
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.900]   who had Memory Mastered eight times.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.740]   Is that right?
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.140]   - Out of all my stars, I think I read that.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.980]   - Eight times.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.180]   And you talk about slow watering of this garden,
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.220]   this mental garden over time.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.980]   He had mastered and mastered and mastered
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.660]   again and again and again.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.940]   And I think that duration,
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.940]   doing it over time and repeating it over and over
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.660]   are just so key to that information
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.660]   being retained in the brain.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.940]   Elias, what about you?
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.940]   Do you feel like, I mean,
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.500]   did you hear anything from families this year?
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.500]   People who perhaps said,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.020]   we've done this for this many years,
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.540]   or it seemed this year,
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.540]   we had a lot of families who had been participating
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.980]   in Memory Mastered for quite some time.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.980]   - So they had a system, I bet.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:55.820]   A thing that they did to prepare.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.380]   - Yeah, so I definitely heard from lots of the families
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.740]   that they had that slow watering for sure.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.380]   They had been doing that for a long time.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.260]   And in your original question, Lisa,
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.580]   I think you asked how involved parents are
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.380]   and other things. - Yes.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.220]   - They definitely are involved.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.660]   And that's one of the things that points back to that unity
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.260]   that they had when they showed up for competition day.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.540]   I think for most families that I talked to,
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.180]   their experience was that parents
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.100]   were heavily involved at the beginning.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.580]   They were setting that pace, that standard.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.500]   This is what we do as a family.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.340]   This is worth it.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.180]   It's exciting.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:37.580]   And then after that, they saw that their student loved it.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.180]   They truly, truly loved it.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.940]   And it was the student that propelled the family forward.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.020]   It was like, "I wanna do this.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.380]   "Let's keep doing this."
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.020]   And those are the students who are really the ones
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.020]   who excel at National Memory Master
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.540]   because they're the ones who take it into their own hands
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.300]   and develop new ways to make it exciting.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.700]   I heard from a lot of kids.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.300]   They were like, "The biggest thing for me
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.380]   "is I had to make it fun.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.980]   "Let's make games, let's go outside at the grocery store.
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.340]   "Let's do memory work with my siblings
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.140]   "and my friends and all that."
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.180]   It's definitely not a, "I'm gonna go study
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.540]   "and shut myself in my room," type thing.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.860]   - Yes.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.700]   - You do in your real life with the people around you.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.620]   And I think that that's what makes it really special.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.460]   - I like that.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.980]   And you know what?
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.260]   There's a lot of wisdom in that.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.780]   And I do see the value in parents getting involved
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.180]   at the beginning, like you said,
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.340]   to help their children set up a system and a pace
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.100]   for eating the elephant.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.580]   How are we gonna do this?
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.620]   I think that's really good.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.500]   Parents probably have better time management skills
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.060]   than most of our older foundation students.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.220]   And so that seems like a good way
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.900]   for parents to be involved.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.540]   But then I absolutely love and support
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.820]   what you said, Elise.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.820]   Then those families then let it be the student's job
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.740]   to propel themselves forward.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.740]   The student needs to drive the bus
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.060]   after the road is constructed.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.100]   And that's how you get the students, like you said,
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.500]   taking ownership.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.780]   And that's how you know the parents
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.660]   are not pushing the students to do something.
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.660]   The family is helping the student to achieve their goal.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.740]   And that's beautiful too.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.740]   And I love the whole idea that the kids who succeed
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.620]   are the ones who made it fun,
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.700]   who played while they practiced,
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.740]   'cause that's sustainable.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.980]   That's really great.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.100]   So Kelly, what are some of the other tips and tricks
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.460]   that you've heard from families through the years?
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.340]   - Well, I think that Mary Poppins had it right
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.580]   with saying in every job that must be done,
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.780]   there's an element of fun.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.460]   You find the fun and snap the job's a game.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.260]   And I think that the first tip or trick
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.460]   that I would offer is something
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.940]   that Elise has already alluded to.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.540]   Find the fun, make it fun.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.900]   Take sidewalk chalk and go out into your driveway
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.660]   and decorate it with memory work.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.940]   Take dry erase markers or washable paint
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.020]   and paint the glass in your house
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.980]   while you sing history songs.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.780]   There are so many different things
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.660]   that you can do to make things fun.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.500]   I know a lot of families will even take
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.060]   the board game Candyland
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.940]   and they'll use our memory work flashcards for each cycle
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.140]   and they'll use them to play the game Candyland,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.020]   which I think is fabulous.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.940]   So so many fun things that you can do.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.820]   And of course, every year out of our finalists,
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.660]   I will hear some unique tip or trick.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.380]   Two years ago, our winner's family told us
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.260]   that he mastered the timeline backwards
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.780]   because they taped the entire set of timeline cards
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.740]   up the stairs.
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.580]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.740]   - This next level of their home.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.020]   And so he would walk up the stairs and recite the timeline.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.060]   And then he would recite it backwards,
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.180]   going down the stairs to the first level of the home.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.420]   And I just thought how brilliant and fun for him.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.380]   And his siblings would chant along with him
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.740]   while he went up and down the stairs.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.020]   So he got physical exercise and mental exercise.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.340]   (laughing)
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.860]   And this year, just recently,
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.420]   I had a conversation with our winner, Ewan Fisher,
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.300]   from this year's competition.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.620]   And I found out a new way to memorize the timeline.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.180]   His sisters are very involved in dance
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.860]   and every year at Christmas time,
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.820]   they participate in the Nutcracker.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.660]   - Yes.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.220]   - And Ewan told me that he memorized the timeline backwards
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.100]   by setting it to the second act of the Nutcracker,
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.940]   the music.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.780]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.940]   - And so he said he'll never listen to the Nutcracker
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.240]   in the same way ever again,
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.140]   because he'll only be hearing
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.340]   the lyrics to the timeline song.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.980]   So I think it really is,
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.900]   the biggest tip is finding the fun
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.660]   and then doing things over and over again
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.180]   until they are committed to memory
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.980]   and then sharing them with others.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.780]   You know, I mean, I can't tell you many times
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.580]   my children would be in the grocery store
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.600]   and they would be singing the president's song
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.100]   and people would turn around
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.920]   and they would look at us like,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.480]   who are these children and how do they know this?
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.700]   - Right, right.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.060]   - Sharing that is part of the joy, right?
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.460]   You know, sharing that memory work
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.780]   that's been mastered with other people in your life
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.940]   and then telling them, you know what?
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.500]   I memorized this timeline song
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.940]   so that when I get older,
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.580]   I'll know when these things happened in history
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.820]   or I memorized the president's
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.020]   so that I can tell you, you know,
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.980]   which president was leading our country
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.580]   at a certain point in history.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.420]   So there's always a purpose,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.060]   but if you find the fun,
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.660]   it makes it easier to accomplish what needs to be done.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.100]   I did not mean for that to rhyme,
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:24:59.940]   but there you go.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.820]   - That is too funny, that is too funny.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.800]   You heard it here first, folks.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.340]   (laughing)
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.020]   We are Dr. Seuss here on The Everyday Educator.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.180]   That's really good.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.020]   I like that.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.420]   The exhortation to share your memory work,
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.620]   share what you're doing.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:20.420]   Other people might be drawn into the game or the song
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.160]   and they can join you on your quest.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.280]   I like that a lot.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.980]   So would you encourage people
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   who maybe have heard some of these podcasts
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.000]   or went to national conference
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.780]   and saw some of the memory masters in action,
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:42.780]   how early should people start pursuing memory master
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.020]   for next year?
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.840]   - Today, would be my answer.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.660]   (laughing)
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.920]   I actually just had a conversation
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.460]   with a lady over the phone today about this very thing.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.500]   One of her families, her community was wondering,
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.420]   when should we start?
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.900]   When should my daughter start?
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.720]   - Yeah.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.980]   - And today is the answer for that.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.420]   - Oh, that's so fun.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.660]   The sheer amount of information alone
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.020]   kind of alludes to that fact,
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.380]   like, okay, it's gonna take a while
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.420]   to get three cycles of memory work down.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:21.420]   But then also the level of mastery
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.340]   that is required for national memory master,
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.360]   it is a very high bar to meet.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.780]   And it does require time,
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.340]   that slow watering Kelly talked about.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.720]   And also why would you wanna put off the fun
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.460]   is another way of looking at it.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.500]   - That's great.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.580]   - Yeah, I remember that memory work was a ton of fun
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.580]   when I was doing it.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.940]   And you can definitely have a blast with it,
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.460]   especially over the summer.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.100]   If you're traveling, going to the beach,
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.020]   parks or things like that,
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.120]   you don't have to be cooped up in your home
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.260]   in the dead of winter, reciting math facts.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.940]   You can skip count while you run or all of that stuff.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.180]   - Yes.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.740]   - There's a thousand ways to do it
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.260]   and just incorporate it in your daily life.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.740]   You don't have to sit down and be like,
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.500]   I'm gonna dedicate two hours every day from now
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.300]   till next year's national memory master.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.580]   And that's how I'm gonna be a memory master.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.940]   I would say that you'll probably get burnout that way.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.940]   Just start incorporating it now
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.140]   and make it exciting and enjoyable.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.340]   And I'm sure that you'll have great success.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.300]   - You know what, Elise, you are so wise to be so young.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.980]   That is really true.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.660]   If you incorporate it into your daily life,
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.260]   it just become practicing memory
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.700]   where it becomes what you do.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.380]   And it doesn't become a job and it's not drudgery
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.260]   and you don't get burned out.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:49.260]   It's just a game you play on your way to something else.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.740]   And that can be delightful.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.580]   I love it.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.740]   Okay, so I know families,
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.460]   we've been discussing national memory master,
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.820]   but lots of families
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:06.820]   might not ever decide to go all the way
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.460]   to national memory master.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.060]   But these same families fully believe
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.060]   that memorizing is a key component for classical education.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:23.140]   So I want us to talk for the last part of our podcast today
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.300]   about memorizing for all of us.
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.940]   So if I'm not going to go for national memory master
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.460]   next spring, what's the big deal about memorizing?
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.780]   How is it for all of us?
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.180]   So y'all set the stage.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:46.220]   What is so important about memorizing?
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.620]   - Lisa, I think this is a really valid question
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.620]   because of the world that we live in today, right?
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:56.620]   Nearly every adult has some form of handheld device,
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.220]   and access more knowledge, encyclopedic knowledge
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.020]   that has ever been able to be accessed
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.060]   in the history of the world.
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.540]   And so what is the big deal about memorizing?
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.340]   Why take the time to commit things to memory
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.820]   when you can within a minute
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.180]   have them in the palm of your hand?
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.860]   And I know Elise and I both have thoughts about this
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.540]   and why memorizing is important.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.860]   For me, I know I've already said this,
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.940]   it is building a library of the mind.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.940]   You know, we, in our minds,
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.260]   we have millions, probably, conservatively,
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.260]   mental souvenirs from our sensory experiences in this world.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.260]   And so, you know, for our foundation students,
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.660]   part of those experiences are pieces of memory work.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.580]   And, you know, if you think about them being like a library
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.140]   at the risk of sounding too antiquated,
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:58.060]   they are setting up a Dewey Decimal System of information.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.140]   And for anyone who may be listening and says,
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.060]   "What is the Dewey Decimal System?"
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.340]   (all laughing)
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.580]   Which, a few years ago, I wouldn't think
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.820]   I would need to explain, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.580]   You know, that is a numeric system
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.100]   by which you can find different types of literature
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.820]   within a library.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.060]   And, you know, by memorizing,
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.820]   we are providing structure to our thoughts,
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.380]   we're providing structure to those sensory experiences
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.540]   that we have in the world.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.180]   You know, I think about our foundation students,
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.460]   how they may memorize the timeline song,
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.580]   and already they have a structure
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.180]   for every other historical event
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.820]   that they will encounter throughout their challenge years,
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.980]   throughout the remainder of their adult life,
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.580]   in sequential order.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.700]   So memorizing alone, just at face value,
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.100]   gives us structure for the other information
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.260]   that we're going to take in in this world.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.340]   Elise, what about you?
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.420]   Why do you think memorizing is important?
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.740]   - I absolutely love what you just said
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.300]   about building that structure,
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.500]   and I also love your metaphor about the library.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.220]   I have a similar one that I like to use,
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.660]   and I think of memorizing as the act of furnishing the mind.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.500]   That's kind of how I've always viewed it,
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.060]   and so that structure idea really helps
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.220]   to paint that picture.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.420]   First, you have to put up, oh boy,
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.100]   I'm not into construction,
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.700]   the beams, the walls, the roof, all that,
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.420]   and then you really get to fill it in
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.260]   with the furniture, and the paintings,
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.020]   and the music, and the colors, and all that,
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.420]   and it is so exciting.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.140]   I think that we've lost a lot of the excitement
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.900]   around memory, which has been experienced
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.580]   throughout all of history,
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.900]   and I think a lot of it, you could make the argument,
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.300]   comes from that cell phone in your back pocket,
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   but that's a discussion for another day, I'm sure.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.260]   Overall, I can think of two main reasons
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.900]   why memory is so important,
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.300]   just based off of that idea of furnishing your mind.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:03.300]   First is academically, it is undeniably useful and helpful.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.340]   There's actually a quote from Daniel Borstein,
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.940]   who wrote the book, "The Discoverers,"
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.380]   which we study and challenge for classical conversations,
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.340]   and I love this quote,
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.300]   so I'm just gonna read it aloud if that's all right.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.620]   - Yes, that'd be great.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.820]   - He says, "By memory and in memory,
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.580]   the fruits of education are garnered,
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.500]   preserved, and stored."
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.780]   And so just that alone, the way he breaks it down,
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.420]   it's beautiful words, which makes it exciting to read,
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.900]   but then also it's so true, and that skill,
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.180]   we cannot just get rid of it.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.020]   You need to remember what you're learning,
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.660]   or else you have to ask yourself,
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.780]   what is the purpose of education?
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.100]   Why are you even going to school
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.980]   if you're not gonna retain any of it?
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.100]   So academically, it's absolutely essential
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.060]   that you practice the skills of memory,
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.300]   but then also there's the spiritual aspect of it,
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.940]   of what do you...
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.180]   You're building your character and your desires
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.700]   when you memorize good and true and beautiful things,
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.580]   and I think that it's so important to keep that in mind
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.580]   as we're training the next generation
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.660]   through classical conversations to love memory,
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.980]   and in doing so, reminding adults
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.180]   who may have forgotten that,
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.620]   that this is a beautiful skill,
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.180]   it's a necessary skill,
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.260]   and it will really serve you well
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.380]   if you choose to memorize the good, true, and beautiful.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:33.100]   - Those are such inspiring answers from both of you.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:39.380]   You have given all of us a good reason to memorize.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.820]   I love the fact that when we commit things to memory,
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.820]   we have sealed a personal connection with information.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.380]   It becomes part of our story
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.180]   because it's part of our memory,
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.060]   and it becomes part of the context
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:05.060]   that we use to explain the rest of the world to us.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.180]   And when we have memorized things,
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:13.180]   they become part of the story that we understand
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.780]   about the world that God is showing to us.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.020]   And so I love all of those goals.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.140]   And I love that you brought in the fact
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:30.140]   that even parents need to recognize
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.980]   these goals of memorizing.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:40.140]   The need to memorize and the beauty of memorizing
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:43.820]   doesn't end with our school years.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.820]   We can really benefit from memorizing.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.700]   We're not done.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:53.700]   How can memorizing be a family affair?
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.500]   Kelly, when do we start?
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.380]   Okay, so a bunch of questions that go along with this.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.780]   How can it be a family affair?
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.780]   And when do we start with our littlest learners?
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.380]   And then, you know, we all know they are like sponges,
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:12.300]   so they love, like I could tell hours worth of stories
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.580]   about my grandson, Gideon,
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.220]   and the way he is constantly amazing me.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:23.220]   He marches around reciting the litany
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.220]   of all the words he knows and all the things that he knows.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.300]   And it's just a delight to him.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.860]   So we know that little children do that,
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.740]   and Gideon's not quite too,
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.540]   but how do we encourage our older students
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.740]   to keep practicing their memorizing skills
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.300]   and not leave it in foundations?
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.620]   Such good questions.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.180]   So I think, first of all,
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.300]   thinking about how memory work can be a family affair,
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.980]   one of the blessings as a parent that we have from the Lord
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.140]   is that we are given the role of,
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.500]   if we follow the metaphor of the library,
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.060]   the role of being our children's first mental librarians.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.980]   You know, we are curating the content
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.620]   that is being placed on the shelves of their minds,
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.700]   even at an early age.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.980]   So when you read the book, "Brown Bear, Brown Bear,
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.260]   What Do You See?"
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.420]   you are helping them to establish the ideas,
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.740]   name the ideas of what colors are,
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.180]   what these animals are.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.180]   They're already putting that information
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.540]   on the mental shelves of their minds.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.500]   And, you know, thinking about, you know,
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.420]   when do we start?
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.820]   Oh my goodness, right away.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:37.180]   It's like Elisa's answer for memory master, right away.
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.980]   I can remember when all three of my children
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.220]   were teeny tiny babies.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.500]   I think I read them their first book in the hospital.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.700]   - And of course, you know, some people might say,
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.380]   "Oh, you know, they're basically an intellectual potato
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.220]   at that point.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.500]   What can they retain?"
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.260]   But I'm gonna tell you this.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:00.380]   I think that I believe that God has designed our minds
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.260]   in such an incredible way
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.980]   that even those earliest experiences
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.100]   have impact on our children.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.140]   Whether they see us holding a book
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.780]   and they hear us reciting words,
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.740]   eventually they're going to master those words.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.260]   I personally have memorized so many children's books
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.660]   from reading them over and over.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.620]   "Goodnight Moon," you know,
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.380]   is one of my children's favorites.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.500]   And if I start in with the text of "Goodnight Moon,"
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.980]   all three of my children can recite it along with me
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.860]   because from their earliest days,
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.780]   we have made memorizing together just a gift,
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.060]   a family gift that we give one another.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.060]   It is family culture to be memorizers.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.660]   And you know, with our littlest learners,
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.540]   they take so much joy in that.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.180]   I mean, at the National Memory Master Competition,
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.660]   we were watching these students
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.540]   who were in their final year of foundation.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.100]   So that means next year,
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.820]   they'll be beginning the journey into Challenge A.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.380]   We saw them joyfully reciting their memory work.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.020]   There was no drudgery.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.580]   It was effortless and simple to them
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.660]   and delightful to share what they had memorized.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.340]   Now, I will say this,
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.820]   when our children move from the grammar,
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.900]   you know, stage where everything,
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.820]   it's so much fun to repeat and to play,
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.780]   and they begin contemplating and reasoning
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.620]   and fitting those puzzle pieces of ideas together,
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.220]   the joy of memorizing can be lost
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.140]   if we don't take care to cultivate it.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.900]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.260]   - You know, as our children get older,
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.420]   we also need to consider the types of things
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.940]   that we're asking them to memorize.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.100]   Now, I will say this,
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.220]   I still delighted in having my children
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.220]   memorize nonsensical, fun things.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.060]   - Yes, yes.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:50.900]   - Even when they were older,
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.500]   it's because we love the sounds of the words.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.020]   And I think that is also a skill that needs to be acquired.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.940]   You know, just listening to, as Elise said,
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.940]   the beauty of words is so key for our students
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.380]   in helping them to become good writers
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.700]   because they've heard good writing
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.180]   and they know what it sounds like.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.460]   So I think, you know, continuing to cultivate,
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.340]   not letting ourselves get to a place
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.980]   where we think memorizing is obsolete.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.460]   One of the things Elise said earlier
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.780]   is how we're contributing to our character.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.460]   You know, forming our character is a never ending process
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.980]   because we are human.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.420]   We are made in the image of God,
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.860]   but we are not gods ourselves.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.540]   And so that character will continually be cultivated
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.940]   and memorization, committing those pieces
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.940]   of information to memory is a part of that process.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:50.300]   So, you know, I would say as our children are getting older,
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.180]   encouraging them to continue memorizing
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.700]   may look a little different than when you're skip counting
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.340]   or you're making muscle man arms as you, you know,
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.180]   skip or recite memorization facts.
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.860]   It might simply be walking around the block together
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.500]   and reciting a passage of scripture together.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.140]   Or, you know, our challenge program
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.740]   has so many wonderful built-in opportunities
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.420]   for memorization.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.620]   It simply could be getting in the car with your student
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.900]   and letting them recite
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.260]   while you're driving to the grocery store.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.140]   But always I think, and we've already alluded to this too,
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.380]   the element of togetherness strengthens that act of memory
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.300]   because you're able to recite together.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.540]   And I think for our students that emphasizes to them that,
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:39.540]   hey, we think memorizing is important too as parents
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.820]   and we should be continuing to do that ourselves.
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.700]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.420]   I really love that.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.540]   I think that listeners can tell
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.340]   that we are all three really big on family
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.620]   strengthening their memory muscles.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.660]   And so I wanna give,
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.580]   so there may be listeners out there who say,
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.220]   okay, you have convinced me.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.420]   I can see that this is a good thing
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.900]   to start with my little guys and I wanna keep doing it.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.740]   Or maybe I wanna start doing it
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.020]   with my older children as well.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.580]   But I don't know what to memorize.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.900]   How do we start?
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.500]   You guys, let's brainstorm
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.660]   for just the last couple of minutes.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.660]   What are some things that families could memorize together?
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.700]   And you guys feel free to tell me some things
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.860]   that your family have done together well,
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.060]   or things that you discovered,
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.100]   they sounded good, but it didn't work out.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.180]   So be really practical, okay?
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.140]   - There are so many things I could think of
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.820]   and lots of them come from my experience
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.980]   in the Challenge program.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.420]   Like Kelly said, I think that lots of older students
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:55.460]   can lose that excitement of memory.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.100]   And that definitely happened to me
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:02.060]   until we came to the study of Shakespeare.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:06.260]   And in Challenge, you have to memorize,
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.780]   I believe it's about 30 lines of Shakespeare
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.300]   and give it in a dramatic interpretation.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.180]   I did this with one of my good friends
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.780]   and we had so much fun with it.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:20.780]   But man, there's a reason why Shakespeare is so famous.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:25.900]   His beautiful words and exciting stories
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.460]   really helped to awaken that desire
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.900]   to memorize his work in me.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.620]   For example, my favorite Shakespeare speech
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.660]   in all the Shakespeare plays I've read
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.540]   is Mark Antony's speech in Julius Caesar
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.060]   after they kill Caesar.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.140]   It is riveting to me.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.260]   I absolutely love it.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.380]   And so I have it in my sites to memorize coming up here,
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.980]   but that is an amazing one or anything from Macbeth
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.260]   or Much Ado About Nothing.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.420]   They're all so exciting.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.260]   I highly suggest Shakespeare.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:06.660]   But also just, well, of course there's scripture,
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.340]   which we're commanded to memorize.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.300]   So that's a good extensive that right there.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:16.300]   But poetry, I was actually just at a conference
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.060]   this past week and was talking to Mr. Andrew Pudowa
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:23.580]   about memorization and looking through his book.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.580]   And he has all these fun poems in there
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.780]   that are meant for smaller children.
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.420]   And I have a small baby cousin who when he grows up,
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.020]   I want to be able to share those fun,
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.580]   delightful poems with him.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.100]   And so just reminding older students
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.860]   that they can delight younger students
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.300]   with what they commit to memory.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.060]   It's not always just about what they think
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.380]   that they'll directly benefit from.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:53.260]   So think outside the box and what really excites you.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.100]   And some people aren't as in love with Shakespeare as I am.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.540]   So you don't have to go there,
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.100]   but those are just some things I've been thinking about
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.660]   where just pick things that excite you,
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.940]   that you can use in your day-to-day life
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:11.700]   and that will delight those who hear it.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.540]   - That's great.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.700]   That's a great suggestion.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:18.700]   Kelly, I know that you love music and you love poetry.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.460]   Tell me some things that you have memorized
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.020]   with your family.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:23.940]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.820]   So many things set to music.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.260]   My children laugh.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.940]   Anytime that we can't memorize something,
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.180]   they're like, "Mom, put it to a song."
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.180]   So they have memorized the first 18 elements
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.340]   of the periodic table set to music,
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.260]   which was incredibly helpful
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.260]   when they've passed through chemistry
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.620]   to have that information tucked away.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.220]   And I would echo so many of the ideas
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.380]   that Elise has already given to you.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.700]   For our family, poetry,
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.260]   it was so helpful to them
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.260]   in strengthening those memorizing muscles
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:00.020]   because you can memorize short poems,
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.140]   haiku or a cinquain,
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.740]   or you can memorize epic poems,
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.300]   not necessarily all at once,
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:11.020]   but bit by bit until you've mastered the entire thing.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.900]   So there really are so many wonderful things in the world
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.220]   to commit to the shelves of the library of your mind.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.940]   The fun part is choosing
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.380]   what you want to spend time and energy memorizing.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.380]   I can remember as a young child,
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.380]   I was asked to memorize "Twas the Night Before Christmas"
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:36.380]   for a Christmas program at my elementary school.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:40.580]   And every single day I would walk home from school
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.740]   to my grandmother's house.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.260]   She only lived a few blocks away from the school.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.580]   And I would recite "Twas the Night Before Christmas"
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.060]   to the cadence of my squeaky little shoes,
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.060]   hitting the concrete one after the other.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.460]   "Twas the night before Christmas,"
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.700]   and all through the house.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.820]   And even now as an adult, I still remember it
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:02.060]   because I took time to commit it to memory.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.020]   And it definitely was not something
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.180]   that I woke up the day before Christmas and said,
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.740]   "I think I'm going to memorize this poem."
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.740]   It became a part of who I am.
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.940]   And so I would just strongly encourage our families
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.660]   to, like Elise said,
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.140]   look for those things that bring you joy.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.900]   I would say passages of scripture,
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.140]   which describe the qualities of God,
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.740]   are a wonderful place to start.
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:32.100]   The Ten Commandments is part of our memory work.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.500]   That's also a great way to start.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.980]   And for our littlest ones,
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.580]   they can memorize the Ten Commandments
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.900]   by holding up 10 fingers
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.220]   and reciting one for each finger
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.220]   using another tool of memory.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.140]   So there are so many wonderful things
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.900]   in the world that we can memorize.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.380]   It's just up to you to choose
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.660]   what you want in your mental library.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.020]   - Those are great suggestions.
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.100]   What I want to say to families is,
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:03.100]   look, delight in words with your family.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:08.020]   Delight in the sounds, delight in the rhythm,
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:09.700]   delight in rhyme.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:16.060]   Kelly and Elise have given you some really great suggestions.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.780]   But if they all sound too serious for the summer,
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.700]   hey, listen, memorize song lyrics.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:29.700]   Memorize "Silly Songs with Larry" from Veggie Tales.
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.980]   Memorize a hymn that you sang at church.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.780]   Ask your teenagers.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.220]   Get them to share some of the song lyrics
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.020]   from the music that they are listening to.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.100]   It's a great way for you to see what they're listening to.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.540]   But then offer to memorize a song lyric
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.500]   that is meaningful to them with them.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.820]   You can memorize counting rhymes
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.780]   that you can practice while you're skipping rope
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.500]   or bouncing balls.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:04.580]   Listen, you guys, you can stretch your memory muscle
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.580]   by memorizing dialogue from movies, from film dialogue.
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.980]   And some of the first things that we memorize,
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.980]   well, maybe not the first things,
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.260]   but when the girls were really little,
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.580]   we had a tradition on the 4th of July.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.900]   Now, we are a big musical theater kind of family.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.940]   And so we, on the 4th of July,
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.220]   we always watched "The Music Man."
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.380]   And one of the earliest things I can remember
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.820]   is one of the songs from there.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.660]   He's a what?
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:38.500]   He's a what?
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.320]   He's a music man.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.580]   And he plays clarinet with the kids in the town.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.180]   Big brass bass, big brass bass.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.460]   And the piccolo, the piccolo with uniforms too.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.100]   And my girls memorized this.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.260]   They were teeny.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:54.260]   And I had no idea that the rhythm and the cadence
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.740]   and the movement of that rhyme
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.740]   had taken root in their minds.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.620]   So listen, families, find silly things to memorize.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.940]   What tickles your child's ear first,
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.460]   especially for your little ones?
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.540]   'Cause if it tickles their ear,
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.340]   it will worm its way in
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.980]   and they'll be able to memorize it.
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.620]   And it will make them giggle.
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:17.980]   And that makes, anything that makes them laugh
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.260]   makes them wanna do it again.
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:25.180]   But find out what makes your teenager's ears tingle.
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.540]   What touches their heart?
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:30.340]   And offer to memorize that with them.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.660]   It will build, like we've said this whole time,
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.540]   what you're doing is building a library of the mind,
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:40.620]   but you are also building a community of heart
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.020]   in your family.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:46.140]   So yeah, we wanted to talk about National Memory Master,
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:50.660]   but we really, really wanted all of our families to see
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.300]   that memorizing is a family affair
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.820]   and it is worth pursuing all by itself.
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.820]   Kelly, Elise, thank you so much for sharing
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.820]   your wisdom and your inspiration again.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.700]   I really appreciate it.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.540]   - Absolutely.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.620]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.380]   - This has been really fun.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.180]   This has been really fun.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:16.180]   And so families, I know your academic year might be ending
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.740]   and you're looking for fun things to do

[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.820]   but going somewhere, taking a trip can be fun too.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:31.820]   I wanna remind you CC families that Great Wolf Lodge
