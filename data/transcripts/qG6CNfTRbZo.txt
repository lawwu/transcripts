[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620]   "Certain individuals of certain occupations
[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.360]   "tend to be more creative
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.560]   "and that creativity is associated with,"
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.640]   again, associated, this isn't causal,
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.120]   it's associated or correlated with,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.400]   "higher levels or incidents of bipolar, depression,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.120]   "and maybe even other forms of depression."
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.080]   These are people that are not just good at what they do,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.800]   but are exceptional at what they do.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.440]   "Among the professions they looked at in this study,"
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.800]   'cause they didn't look at all professions,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.300]   "those in the military
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.380]   "and those who are professional athletes
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.640]   "or had jobs in the social or natural sciences,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.560]   "there was a lower percentage of those
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.720]   "that had depression or mania.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.660]   "In some cases, like those who are professional athletes,
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.480]   "there was no incidents of mania."
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.800]   It is really striking to see how the creative occupations,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.880]   poetry, fiction, art, nonfiction writing,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.120]   music composition, theater, much higher incidents.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.520]   We'd be wrong to say that certain aspects
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.120]   of manic episodes don't lend themselves well to creativity.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.780]   In no way, shape, or form do I believe
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.300]   that being depressed is a good thing
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.100]   or that being manic is a good thing.
