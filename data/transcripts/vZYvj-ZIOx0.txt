[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Probably half the people I work with don't qualify for need-based aid per se,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   but they still send their kids to college. Sometimes the colleges you're looking at
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.800]   will ultimately be full price, and you have to decide, well, am I going to write a check for 90,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.000]   or am I going to pursue other schools, or maybe you get some merit aid, or, you know, again,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.440]   your local state school might only be 30, and kind of finding that balance. But there's still a lot
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.800]   you can do, right? There's tax planning, there's saving and investing, there's merit aid, there's
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.400]   negotiating with the schools, there's a lot of planning, just realizing that need-based aid is
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.040]   not on the list. And that's where I think a lot of people get a little confused, is there's a lot
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.040]   more to it than, will I qualify for need-based aid or not? Because even if you don't, you know,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.760]   again, we didn't qualify for need-based aid. College is canceled? No, we're still going,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.520]   and now it's going to be expensive. So how are we going to raise those kind of funds?
