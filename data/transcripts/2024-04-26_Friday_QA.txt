[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.840]   We begin with Liliana in Seattle.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.560]   Welcome, Liliana.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.520]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.600]   - Hello, Joshua.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.800]   I'm really glad to be here.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.720]   Thank you for having me and giving the opportunity to ask you a question.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.080]   Doing great.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.760]   I've actually been part of your Radical Family Camp, which was amazing and fantastic.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.280]   Wanted to thank you for that experience.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.840]   And also, I have a question for you today.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.360]   I come from, let's say, post-Soviet from Russia,
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   from one of the post-Soviet countries.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.720]   We have this cultural thing that kind of sets up kids.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.520]   I have one kid who's just only one and a half years old.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.920]   We have this cultural aspect of setting them up for success by working hard,
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.800]   grinding, studying a lot, and there's this overall belief
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.480]   that only through the horribles and disadvantages of life,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.840]   one can become truly a strong personality and successful personality.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.640]   So this is kind of the mindset and mentality I've grown up in.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.960]   I also believe that some of my friends from China and from India
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.800]   also have similar mindsets where they kind of train their kids
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.000]   to be super successful by studying a lot and working a lot.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.920]   And my question is in the realm of those concepts of bringing kids,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.280]   because when I came to the West, so to speak,
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.800]   I found that a lot of families do not have more resources.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.120]   First of all, probably our countries that I've mentioned, like Russia, China,
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.000]   India, have less resources.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's why it's like a zero-sum game attitude, I could say, to life in general.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.600]   But here in the West, it's a much more comfortable life, more resources.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.680]   Families sometimes even have some assets in place for their kids.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.840]   Some are able to pay for the college and such.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.080]   So my question is, what, from your perspective,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.320]   can we do to set up our little kid in the future,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.200]   like being, I don't know, 15 years or 10 years, whatever,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.400]   or to be a resilient, so to speak, successful.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.640]   When I say successful, I don't only mean money,
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.480]   but overall kind of this resilient personality, if you know what I mean.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.040]   Person without giving him a hard time, if you know what I mean.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.200]   And making it difficult, because I've myself been brought up without food, without money.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.760]   After the fall of the Soviet Union, it's really a survival mode,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.320]   which I then had to take off myself with a long years of therapy.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   Obviously, I don't want to put my child in a survival mode and such.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.640]   So what do you think, how can we raise children in a different way
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.280]   to make them still resilient and motivated to work hard in life,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.960]   which every person definitely needs?
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.360]   I would really love to hear your perspective on that aspect.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.920]   Thank you.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.720]   I love the question.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.440]   Let's pretend that you were going to raise your child the way that you were raised,
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.680]   meaning that you didn't question the culture.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.320]   You didn't think, oh, maybe there might be a better way.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.440]   You were just going to reproduce in your child
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.880]   what your parents and your home culture produced in you.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.680]   How specifically would you do that?
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.920]   What would you do in order to express that culture?
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.280]   That's a great question to ask.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.760]   I love it, because immediately I thought that it's like 50/50.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.640]   It's like throwing a child into the water, hoping the kid can swim,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.760]   but maybe there will be some problems along the way.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.480]   I can say that that's a great question.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.240]   No money for education, no pocket money.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.160]   You have to start working when you're 16 years old,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.160]   really early to provide for yourself and sometimes even for your family.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.960]   A really low resource.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.000]   Also, along the way, it would be always saying that,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.760]   look, the others are doing better than you do.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.160]   Look at Mary, a neighbor's daughter.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.560]   She's performing better than you in school.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.840]   What the hell are you doing?
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.160]   Those type of comparison in upbringing when you compare the kid to others,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.560]   and this is how you negative motivation at its finest.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.840]   You could do better than this.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:07.040]   Negative motivation and also not providing any setup for anything.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.440]   This is a question that intrigues me quite a lot.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.760]   I have a few thoughts on it.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   What I don't have is a lot of hard evidence.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.240]   I don't have any data that I could present on this.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.400]   I haven't found any data on this yet.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.600]   There may be books or people who have researched this out there,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.680]   but so far, I haven't come across very much of that.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.040]   So, I'll cite what I have come across for you,
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.480]   but just know that most of my answers to this question are coming
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.240]   from personal experience and from observations of the world
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.680]   and just a little bit of thought about it not coming from a strong research base.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.400]   And if anybody knows of a strong research base
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.520]   to get me started in the right direction, I would welcome those comments.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:07.360]   I think that it's important to identify specifically what you would do differently
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.080]   because there are two truths that I think need to go together.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.600]   Number one, having character.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   We'll just describe it as character.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.000]   Having character is foundational and fundamental to success in life.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.840]   Having a strong work ethic, I think, is fundamental and foundational to success in life.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.960]   And so, if we have the choice between,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.720]   let's say that we could just magically produce a child who did have a work ethic
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.400]   or we could magically produce a child who did not have a work ethic,
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.640]   I don't think anybody would argue that the child without a work ethic is any better off.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.520]   Similarly, if we could produce a child of strong character
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.720]   versus a child who's not of strong character,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.120]   nobody would argue that the child is better off if he doesn't have a strong character.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.240]   I think probably the one word we could use for this would be the word "grit."
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.240]   That's probably where the most research is done.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.120]   Angela Duckworth is probably the most famous psychologist
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.240]   who's written extensively on this with her work of grit,
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.320]   showing how gritty children, children who have determination and a desire to succeed,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.040]   are often the ones who do the best.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:27.520]   And I think that a strong, I'm going to call it military upbringing,
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.880]   could certainly produce people of character and people of grit.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.040]   I think back to a society like the Spartans.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.320]   And if you go back and you think about when Lycurgus laid out the law for Sparta,
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.840]   and he laid out this just hardcore training regimen for the way that
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.040]   children are being brought up is in very austere conditions with constant discomfort
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.960]   and constant, you know, constant discomfort,
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.800]   constant difficulty, constant shortage, constant lack.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.400]   Then that did succeed in creating men who were warriors, who were strong and capable warriors,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:18.320]   who were able to do many remarkable things with that basic grit that was built into them.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.880]   The challenge is that I'm not sure that grit alone is a sufficient
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.000]   ingredient in the recipe for success.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:39.120]   I think that grit is useful and helpful, but that it also has downsides to it.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:46.480]   And so, if we only focus on that and that alone, then it seems to me like we're missing
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.120]   other important attributes and traits that children need in order to build
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.760]   successful lives for the long term.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.080]   So, as you alluded to, I have some friends who grew up in the Soviet Union,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.080]   and under that educational system.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.800]   And if you go back and you look at the Soviet Union and what that empire was able to produce,
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:17.680]   it truly was able to produce some citizens who had stellar academic ability,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.400]   incredible mathematicians, and world-class engineers, and things like that.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.560]   I see the same thing happening in Asian educational systems today.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.680]   I don't know to what degree the current Russian model of education mirrors the culture that you
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.400]   grew up in, but where I've spent the most time reading about it is in basically what I'll call
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.200]   the Asian system.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.840]   And I would include in that the Chinese system, Singapore, we could include India in that,
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.360]   where there's just this very grueling approach to academics.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:57.200]   And in Korea, they have a test day where it's all about this one annual test, and the students just
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   slave away preparing for this test.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.880]   And basically, your results on these tests determine your life and where your life can
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.080]   go in the future.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.560]   And again, I think that produces certain qualities, certain characteristics that are positive,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.080]   that give good outcomes.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.160]   But they also, there's a flip side to it.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.400]   There's a lack of creativity that can often be found in that.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.240]   I can't cite this, so I could be mistaken about this.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.280]   But I have an impression that I've read or seen analysis at some point along the way
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:36.000]   of people talking about how in the American model, the American model excels in creating
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.800]   individuals who are able to be creative.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.000]   I have a friend of mine who works for an international school.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.040]   And I've spent a lot of time talking with him about universities.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.240]   He's a guidance counselor for international students who want to go to university.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.000]   And I talked to him about why people choose different universities.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.240]   Why would somebody go to the United States as compared to other places around the world
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.080]   where you can also go and study?
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.800]   And there are many, I've talked, there's incredible scholarship programs.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.320]   The Japanese government has a scholarship program for people who want to come to Japan
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.280]   and study there.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.960]   If you get the scholarship, they'll pay all of your tuition at a Japanese university.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.880]   China has a number of scholarship programs where they'll pay all of your university
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.760]   tuition in China.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:27.360]   The, sorry, Europe is full of universities that are tuition free, even for non-EU citizens
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.800]   to participate in.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:35.600]   And yet many of the wealthy families that he advises and counsels will still send their
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.120]   children to the United States and to go to college and pay enormous tuition fees for
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.520]   the privilege of their attending universities.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.480]   And I asked him, I said, why?
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.240]   And he says, well, one of the things that the United States university system can do,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:56.160]   and just to be clear, I consider the current mainstream US university system to be pretty
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.080]   flawed, but one of the things that it can do is it can create students who think creatively
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.360]   about solutions, who think broadly and are able to come up with solutions that aren't
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.600]   just based upon grinding it out, just applying more work effort or more work ethic to the
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.640]   problem.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.760]   And that can be a whole different skill set.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:25.200]   And so I guess my answer is that I think that both of those things are important, that having
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.000]   work ethic is important and necessary, having character is important and necessary, but
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.520]   it's not sufficient.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.640]   And in many cases, if you look at basically success in life, if you take an individual
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.040]   that you think is successful, very rarely would I find someone who I would characterize
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.720]   as successful broadly.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   And we can use finances exclusively, or we can just say broadly successful in life.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.400]   Very rarely would I find somebody who just puts nose to the grindstone and does nothing
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.440]   but work, work, work, work, work, and characterize that person as successful.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.320]   If they are successful, they're usually successful in one dimension, in one domain of life.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.280]   And life is more varied than that.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.920]   So my thought on it is, or at least what I aspire to do, is I aspire to try to do both
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.120]   of those things.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:20.960]   And my answer for it is to, so specifically, usually we're talking about something related
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.240]   to education and schooling.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.360]   Now, you mentioned money and basically negative reinforcement.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.120]   Compare yourself to that other person over there.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.640]   I'll get to those in just a moment.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:38.160]   But in terms of an educational system, I myself have a tendency to disparage those kinds of
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.640]   educational systems that cause people to just work all the time.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.240]   I don't think that they're effective.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.160]   And I think we have good data from learning science to show that they're not nearly as
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.360]   effective as they could be.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:55.280]   And even in terms of work, what a lot of people who we would label as workaholics often do
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:06.720]   is they confuse effort with effectiveness, or they confuse volume with effectiveness.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:15.600]   And at its core, while many disciplines and skills need volume in order to acquire skills,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:24.080]   at its core, most things can be improved by proper application and creative and efficient
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.440]   methodologies.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:34.240]   And so probably the best example from an educational perspective would be to study the teaching
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   or the learning of mathematics.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.080]   And there's a balance here.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.280]   There's a war that wages of what is often labeled as the drill and kill approach, where
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.520]   you just do mathematics constantly, nonstop mathematics, more, more, more, more, more,
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.760]   systematically, as compared to learning to think about why you're doing what you're doing
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.280]   so that you understand the math.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:59.440]   And what they have—recently I finished—and I would cite here the book Range by David
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:05.200]   Epstein, the subtitle is Why Generalists Succeed in a Specialized World.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.560]   And one of the things I learned from that book that I read recently that I had never
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:16.160]   understood was how—why certain math techniques are being emphasized.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.840]   The author of that book, Epstein, cited a study that some learning psychologists had
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.600]   done where they had gone into math classrooms all around the world, and they had recorded
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.840]   in detail some of the math lessons that were being taught.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.920]   And they carefully detailed everything that the teacher was doing, everything that was
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.480]   said.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.440]   They videotaped them.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.400]   They had transcripts.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.160]   And then they followed the students' test scores and their long-term effectiveness with
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.280]   mathematics.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:52.240]   And they discovered that when the teacher basically taught mathematics with a rote learning
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.920]   approach of, "Hey, this is how you do long division.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.680]   You just do this into this into this into this.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.240]   You do this step.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.680]   You bring down the number here," then the student was never able to incorporate those
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.720]   mathematical techniques at a deeper level.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:12.240]   But if the student—if the teacher focused on a conceptual teaching of it rather than
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.680]   a procedural approach, then they wound up with better outcomes.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.240]   And for me, that was an enormous lightbulb moment, because I, like many, have griped
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.520]   about the modern methods of teaching mathematics.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.080]   In the United States, the debate over this has been related to what is called the Common
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.960]   Core Standards.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.920]   And—
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:38.160]   I'm Jane Perlez, long-time foreign correspondent and former Beijing bureau chief for The New
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.360]   York Times.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:46.400]   I've been a foreign correspondent in lots of places—Somalia, Indonesia, Pakistan—but
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.040]   nowhere as important to the world as China.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.080]   I mean, China is not dropping anti-democratic paratroopers into Montana.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.040]   But, of course, we did see things like the weather balloon/spy balloon riveting the whole
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.800]   country for a week.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.080]   This is Face/Off, an eight-part series in which we'll take you behind the scenes to
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.240]   key moments in the tumultuous U.S.-China relationship.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:16.480]   We'll speak with a diplomat, a spy, a tech reporter, a U.S. admiral, even Yo-Yo Ma.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.080]   Plus, my pal and noted China historian Rana Mitter joins the conversation.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.120]   We'll look at what's driving the two nations apart and explore whether anything can help
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.560]   bring them back together.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.200]   Face/Off launches April 9th.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.040]   What many people find is they send their child off to fourth-grade math or fifth-grade math,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.160]   sixth-grade math, and the child comes home with some weird, like, boxing approach.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.200]   And the—it's like, why are you trying to solve your division problem with these weird
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.320]   boxes?
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.640]   And the parent, very well-meaning, as I myself have done, says, "Listen, I'm just going
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.440]   to teach you how to do it.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.480]   This is the easier way.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.320]   And look, this is how you do long division."
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.160]   I now understand what the Common Core approach is trying to accomplish in a way that I didn't
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.560]   before.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.360]   It's trying to get at the conceptual thinking and the conceptual understanding of mathematics
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   rather than just the procedural basis.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.960]   Now, the flip side, we can't—I don't think it's smart to be extremist about it.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.760]   On the flip side, you could say, "Well, it's just a drill and kill."
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.400]   But on the other side, you need to have enough practice with the actual concepts in order
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.600]   to really master them.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.000]   Practice leads to mastery.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.400]   And so, with many things related to education, I would like to see it go through the middle
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:35.200]   and benefit from understanding and then have sufficient amounts of practice rather than
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.600]   just kind of drudgery, working it through nonstop.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:48.080]   Taking education further, if you look at what different systems produce, a system that is
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:56.240]   based upon rote learning, rote practice, rote repetition can produce outcomes where the
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   student actually has the ability to do the work.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:06.320]   But that doesn't seem to be a very intelligent preparation of the student for life.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:13.200]   And so, if I'm running a communist system where I'm trying to create workers who will
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.480]   fit into the collective and I need workers who are very skilled with the basics of engineering,
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.280]   then I would be inclined to go for that kind of approach.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.840]   But if I'm trying to create well-educated students who are prepared for life and prepared
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.080]   and understand their strengths, their weaknesses, their skills, their interests, then I need
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.760]   to give more time for that.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.120]   And my observation of basically coaching a lot of people with big life decisions has
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:47.200]   been that if someone doesn't have a diverse exposure to the world and time to get to know
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   himself, then he's unlikely to be able to make good life decisions for himself.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.040]   He feels lost once he gets out of a constrained system.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:02.480]   So, I'm opposed to just constant, never-ending rote learning from an educational perspective,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.680]   because I don't think it gives us the outcome that we're looking for of a prepared human
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.960]   being who is well-educated, but is also prepared to succeed in life generally.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:19.680]   I think it just creates a highly skilled drone who is able to do computations very quickly
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.720]   and very effectively.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:27.520]   Now, going on to the handling of money, this is another big question, another big debate.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.640]   I grew up probably similar to how you did in the sense that my family didn't have a
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:40.800]   lot of money, and so in even the U.S. American culture, there's a strong ethos of pull yourself
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.240]   up by your own bootstraps.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.080]   And so, I didn't have a lot of money when I was in college, or excuse me, when I was
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.640]   in high school.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.080]   I didn't own a car, but my dad would let me borrow one of the family cars to drive myself
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.040]   to school.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.120]   And when I asked him for some money on occasion, he would give me some money.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.840]   And I worked and I had some of my own money, but I would go to the gas pump and put in
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.320]   six dollars of gas because I couldn't afford any more.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.200]   And I would – so I know what it's like to not have pocket money.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.840]   I know what it's like to – I paid for all of my schooling.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:16.160]   My parents paid for my high school, and then it was always understood that when it comes
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.320]   to college that it would all be on me.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.000]   And I appreciate that because I do feel that that was helpful to me in terms of building
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.560]   character.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.280]   From a more mature perspective, though, I don't think that it was necessary for me
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.640]   to build character.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:41.520]   And what I now look at is I see how much further behind I am from where I could be if my parents
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:47.040]   had had more resources and if I had been able to pursue more interesting opportunities.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.600]   And the specific example I would give is this.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.240]   When I was in college, I heard of people doing unpaid internships.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.800]   And at the time, I couldn't even imagine why somebody – how could somebody go and
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.000]   do an unpaid internship?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.880]   How could I go and work for free?
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.800]   I was working three jobs my freshman year, and I couldn't imagine going and taking
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.840]   an unpaid internship.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.240]   And today I look back and I realize that I should have gone and done the unpaid internship.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.040]   And I see very clearly that when people, especially young people, get involved in just
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:26.080]   constantly working, they lose out on the opportunities to advance based upon relationships,
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.520]   skill building, and creativity because of this intense focus on money.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.080]   I was recently talking to somebody about my advice for a teenager.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.160]   And this teenager is working at a job in fast food, earning money.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.520]   And my comment of my kind of behind-the-scenes advice was I said, "That's wonderful.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.200]   That's really great that she has a job.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.240]   She's 15 years old.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.200]   She has a job.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.080]   She's making money.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.840]   She's working at a fast food restaurant.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.240]   Awesome.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.120]   That's fantastic."
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.080]   That job should not continue for more than three months.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.320]   And if she continues to try to work a job like that for more than three months because
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:10.960]   she needs money, then I consider that an enormous opportunity cost, a lost opportunity for her
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.720]   to try something very, very different.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.320]   I think a 15-year-old should absolutely go and get a job in fast food and do it for three
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:18.560]   months.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.200]   But then after three months, she should go and get a job as an orderly in a hospital,
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.600]   or she should tag along in a law office, or she should go and babysit in a professional
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.640]   daycare.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.200]   And then she should go and you should try different things.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.120]   You need to get exposure to different things.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.800]   And so the big downside that poor people who grow up poor face is that they've never had
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.000]   the exposure to life.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.080]   They've never had the chance to build relationships.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.080]   They've never had exposure to interests.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.320]   And so they see the world as a world of financial scarcity.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:56.800]   And that's where they only have one model for making money, which is work harder at
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   my job, spend less, save more in just that standard model.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:07.920]   And in my interactions with wealthy people over the years, I've come to see how that's
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.360]   not what wealthy people do.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.480]   And there are alternative models that are in many ways superior.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.160]   And I'll just share one more personal story.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:23.440]   When I was in the financial planning business, I was mentoring.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.240]   For a time, I ran our college internship program and I was recruiting college students.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.120]   And I enjoyed working with new representatives.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.200]   And I would go out and do joint work with them and mentor them and do things like that.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.560]   And I was good at what I did.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.000]   I had a lot of technical knowledge.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.280]   If you want to question on some technical thing related to financial planning, Josh
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:43.840]   was the guy.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.320]   I was always the guy who answered all the questions.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.840]   And so I had a good deal of pride in my knowledge from financial planning perspectives.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:27:00.000]   And we hired this guy into our company who was the son of-- he was a rich kid.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   And his job working at the company was the very first job that he had ever had.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.440]   And I was pretty jealous of him.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.680]   I wouldn't probably have said it at the time, but that's truly what it was.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.880]   His parents were super wealthy lawyers from the Northeast.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.920]   He'd come down to Florida.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.880]   They had a Florida home.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.120]   He's staying in their Florida home for free.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.360]   He was staying in-- he had access to his dad's 40-foot fishing boat.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.280]   And he was out every weekend on the fishing boat with all the guys and all the girls in
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.280]   this million-dollar boat that he had access to.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.240]   And yet he comes in and he knew nothing about financial planning.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.680]   He didn't have a clue.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.280]   He didn't know what a Roth IRA was.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.000]   He didn't have a clue.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.240]   And he comes in and gets this job selling insurance and ultimately becoming a financial
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:44.640]   planner.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   He didn't have a clue about any of that stuff.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.240]   I was shocked at how ignorant he was.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   And so I thought, there's no way this guy makes it.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.600]   There's not a chance in the world that he's going to be successful.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.800]   He doesn't have any work ethic.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.520]   He comes in, drives in his BMW that daddy bought for him.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.640]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.560]   Here I am, Mr. Proud.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.920]   I pull myself up by my bootstraps guy.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:12.560]   That guy went on to sell more insurance and set enormous records.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.880]   And today he's a managing partner with that company making millions of dollars a year.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:23.200]   Basically, far more successful than I ever was because he had a totally different sphere
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.840]   of knowledge.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.840]   I had technical knowledge.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.960]   I was a good worker bee.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.920]   I was a good engineer.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:37.280]   I had technical knowledge that I had acquired from my hard work ethic.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.720]   But he had a totally different set of knowledge that I couldn't even relate to.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.520]   And his parents did nothing for him in his career.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.800]   They probably introduced him to some of their friends.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.600]   He probably sold life insurance policies to some of their friends.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.560]   But that was it.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.840]   My parents did the same things.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.640]   I sold life insurance policies to my parents' friends.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.280]   But they had given him a totally different view of the world.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.840]   And I couldn't relate to it because I didn't grow up in it.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:10.160]   But he makes millions and millions of dollars with his business, just a totally different
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.120]   skill set.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:17.200]   So I'd say that it's an interest of mine to try to say, how can you balance these things?
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:26.160]   And I don't think that work ethic is always best achieved through purely academics or
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.680]   even just through working for money.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.280]   Because my friend did have work ethic.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.720]   He had plenty of work ethic.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.520]   And I don't know all the tools that his parents used to help him develop work ethic.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.800]   A lot of times it's sports or athletic endeavors.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:48.480]   There's many ways to acquire work ethic.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.920]   But just doing more academics is not actually helpful.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:58.160]   And it's not actually helpful for financial success or for life success in a world, at
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.760]   least the United States.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.240]   I don't know if it's any difference in terms of resources in the United States versus
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.680]   the Soviet Union.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.480]   I don't know.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.200]   But I think it's probably about the same in any country.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:15.440]   Because it's not those worker bee skills that often pay off the most.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.360]   It's relationship skills.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.720]   It's the ability to think creatively.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.200]   It's the courage to take risks and to make intelligent decisions.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.640]   These are what launch people up the ladder so much faster.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.960]   It's not just doing more.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:38.640]   And I think we have to acknowledge that and then look for ways to incorporate that.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.040]   Very practically, I have a 10-year-old.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.520]   And I've noticed this in myself.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.000]   My 10-year-old, two or three years ago, says, "Daddy, I need to get a job.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.200]   I want to make money."
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.440]   And I look at him and it's like, "What do you need money for?
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.560]   I pay for everything."
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.920]   And, "Well, I don't know.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.960]   But I just need to get a good job."
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.480]   And my answer to him was, "It would be pointless for you to get a job right now because you're
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:05.120]   far better off to spend your time on intellectual pursuits and developing yourself."
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.000]   And that's, I think, the same thing.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.400]   That if we look at the pathway that wealthy people take their children on, it's not – yes,
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.280]   there are benefits to going and working a summer job.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.800]   You get exposure to different things.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.240]   Those things are helpful.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:27.200]   But at its core, I don't want my children to struggle financially because that's going
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.960]   to magically do something for them.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.920]   I don't think it does.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.120]   I think that if you are one who struggled financially and if you come through that,
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.120]   that can put a hunger in you.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.000]   But you're starting off way behind where you otherwise could be.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:47.680]   And I think it makes a lot more sense for us to support children while also having encouraging,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.400]   strong work ethic, strong focus.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.360]   But it's not a matter of just work, work, work, work more.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.480]   It's a matter of developing the skills in another context.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:06.240]   And then finally, in terms of basically negative motivation, I don't know that – I'm pretty
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.320]   uncomfortable with negative motivation.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.560]   I would not say to my children, "Look at so-and-so.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.000]   He's doing better than you.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.560]   So, therefore, you should do more poorly."
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.720]   I couldn't cite this, again, with sociological data, but I'm fairly confident that that
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.920]   doesn't produce good outcomes.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:26.720]   It really doesn't.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.880]   I would never say that to an adult.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.000]   And it just doesn't produce good outcomes.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:41.600]   The best outcomes that an individual experiences in his life come from when he has something
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.120]   that he wants to do, and he has motivation for his own reasons to pursue that thing.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.160]   And parents beating on children and saying, "So-and-so is doing better than you are.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.640]   Shape it up," then that's not a helpful thing.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.080]   It's more likely to cause people to say, "I'm not doing this.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:00.800]   I'm not doing your goals.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.480]   I'm not following your goals.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.920]   I don't care what so-and-so is doing.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.960]   That's not important to me."
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:10.480]   And then also, I think it's a toxic trait for adults to have.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:18.080]   We should never take ourselves and compare ourselves to other people as a sign of how
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.800]   we're doing.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.080]   The only rational person that we should use for comparison is the person that we were.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:30.240]   So, we should focus on looking back and taking satisfaction and confidence and pride in the
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.600]   progress that I have made, based upon, compared to who I was in the past, and look at how
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.400]   well I'm doing, and then learn to rejoice with other people who are also doing well,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.920]   but not compare ourselves to them.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:47.280]   So, in summary, I think that those traits are useful and important, but I don't think
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.920]   that they're the traits of wealth and of wealthy people.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.960]   I think that they are the traits of basically poor people who become factory workers and
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.760]   see the world through a scarcity model, who don't know themselves, and they don't prepare
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.600]   and equip people for success.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.320]   And I think that you can do both of those things.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.560]   I think you can be very skilled with academics.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.800]   I think you can have a strong work ethic.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:17.040]   And I think that you can do it in a generally positive environment where you haven't done
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:23.200]   everything to basically climb a mountain that you don't actually care about climbing.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.800]   What do you think, Liliana?
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.200]   Yeah, I guess there's a lot to think about.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.000]   I want to thank you for bringing in their perspective.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.880]   I really love the idea about looking into other ways to bring up the motivation, the
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.880]   work ethic through athletics and sports and other activities.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:35:00.640]   And I really love the thought about kind of the financial need not to be the main motivation
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.140]   to work.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.280]   I really love this idea.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.640]   I think I will have a lot to think about.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:13.120]   And thankfully, I have some time before the kid grows up enough to do any work.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.480]   So I have a lot of information.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.160]   And thank you for citing the research.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.200]   I've written it down, so I'm going to take a look at it.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.160]   And thanks a lot.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.520]   I really love your perspective.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.320]   My pleasure.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:32.480]   I would add in closing, as I move on, I would add that perhaps one more comment would be
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.440]   appropriate.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:41.760]   As a parent, it's important to always observe what is happening and then respond to what
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.560]   you see happening.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.280]   So let's just use the example I cited from my own parenting role.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:53.360]   Right now, my 10-year-old, just as the example, the one who's saying I want to get a job,
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:59.680]   my 10-year-old is doing very well in academics and is generally showing broadly good work
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.640]   ethic, good focus, making good progress in academics.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.800]   Now, let's assume for a moment that all of that stopped.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.160]   Let's assume that there's no progress being made.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.680]   He's just turning into a lazy bum, not showing any character, no integrity, just wanting
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.320]   to do nothing.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.160]   Well, now, I would go in a different direction.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.480]   And we would say, all right, let's get you a job, right?
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.240]   Let's put the screws to you.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:31.520]   And I could imagine myself, let's say I'm a mega gazillionaire, and I have a child who
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:40.640]   is 20 years old and getting out of college and driving daddy's BMW and has $10,000 a
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.400]   month on his debit card that I just put there automatically for him.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.240]   And he has no motivation.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.560]   He's doing coke in the clubs on the weekend and sleeping in till 1 p.m.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.160]   every day and doing nothing with his life.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.400]   Well, now, everything changes, right?
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:03.280]   Now, you need to bring a different system, a different approach so that there is motivation
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:03.920]   to change.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:10.400]   And so, as a parent, it's our job to identify and say, are you progressing?
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.440]   Are you making progress?
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.520]   Do you need to apply yourself more?
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.320]   And is the environment that you are in appropriate at this stage of development?
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:24.080]   And so, I think that we should always be aware of the fact that we can and should change
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.040]   things as necessary to respond to the actual events happening.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.240]   Ben in Arizona, welcome to the show.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.120]   How can I serve you today?
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.320]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.440]   I was glad to finish your three-hour podcast you recorded yesterday.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.800]   It helps inform the back half of my question today.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.360]   Great.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:53.440]   I want to know your thoughts on the GLP-1 drugs known, I don't know, Wagobe, Ozempic
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:38:00.720]   that will assist individuals with unusually rapid weight loss.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:06.800]   I know you've said before publicly on the podcast and a lot of people probably keep
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.440]   it private to themselves that they have a hard time getting those last few pounds off.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.080]   They have a hard time either staying motivated or eating right or whatever.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:25.680]   These GLP-1, semaglutide, Ozempic as most people call it have been called the miracle
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.360]   drug and you've seen probably a lot of people have heard about people taking those.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   I just want you to riff on it a little bit and you can tie it back to in your financial
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:45.280]   career as a financial planner, there's probably been things not lose weight fast, but gain
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.240]   money fast.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:53.120]   Maybe not a get-rich-quick thing, but oh, if you do this, here's an unusually rapid
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.680]   way to gain wealth.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:02.480]   What is the mindset or long-term or what are your thoughts on this?
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.080]   I haven't heard you talk about this and it's been a couple of years now that these drugs
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:08.800]   have been on the market.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.720]   I appreciate the question.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.120]   I would generally not comment on something like that because while I'm aware of them
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:23.440]   and I read casually, I wouldn't want to profess any kind of expertise that I don't have.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:29.680]   I have not studied them deeply and I'm not deeply knowledgeable about them.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.440]   I'm aware of them, I've read about them, and so I'll give you my straight answer.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.760]   Except in the context of a Friday Q&A when you toss me up a softball and say, "Hey,
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.640]   what do you think about this?"
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.000]   where I'll always answer.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.240]   I don't do podcasts about things that I don't know about.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.840]   Okay, I'm pushing the limit.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.960]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.320]   Let me answer it.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.680]   First, the only drug I use is caffeine.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.160]   I drink coffee and that's the only drug that I use.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:04.000]   And I think in general, it's important for us to be skeptical of drugs because they are
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.040]   miracles and we should be skeptical of them for a few different reasons.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.680]   And so specifically with regard to weight loss drugs, I think that these drugs will
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.960]   probably turn out to be real lifesavers for a lot of people.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.320]   And there are many, many people who have been unable to lose weight, they have diabetes,
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.600]   they have all kinds of issues.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:30.320]   And if this drug can help that to happen, then I think that the downsides of their obesity
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.760]   or their diabetes are so severe that they will be better off consuming the drug.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.800]   And so I have no problem with people taking them.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:44.160]   I think in general, we should be slow to take any kind of external substance.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:51.040]   And the reason for that is I think we have an excessively high confidence in the safety
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.720]   of bodily inputs and we shouldn't be so confident in that.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.720]   The body is a very complex, I don't even want to use the word machine because that
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.240]   puts the wrong image in our mind.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:12.800]   It's a very complex organism and it's very hard to predict what a particular substance
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.440]   or a particular input or additive will do.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:26.080]   And I have very low confidence in the current regime of efficacy testing and safety of most
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.520]   drugs and most inputs to the body.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:38.640]   And my reasons for that is partly due to the testing process in terms of how the short
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.520]   term trials work and how they measure the harm.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:51.040]   I appreciate that biologists have developed advanced models to try to project long-term
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.680]   effects based upon short-term data, and I don't trust them.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:03.360]   I think that there's abundant reasons to see that in some cases, harmful effects from certain
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:12.160]   types of drugs, certain types of medical treatments only show after decades of use for some people.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.440]   And I could cite example after example after example after this, I'll intentionally keep
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:26.960]   it just a little vague in general, but short-term safety testing is not sufficient for somebody
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.160]   who's generally healthy.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.320]   Let me use a non-drug example.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:39.120]   Recently I was amazed to see, a month or two ago, the patient using Elon Musk's Neuralink
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:44.000]   technology, and he was using Neuralink to control a computer.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.960]   And it was just remarkable to see.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:52.240]   But this patient is entirely paralyzed and he's able to use this Neuralink technology
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.840]   to control a computer.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.560]   I think that's a perfect application.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.800]   He's obviously a perfect study participant to be using this technology.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.200]   And if I were paralyzed, I would probably be quickly on the list to try to say, "Hey,
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.240]   I want to get Neuralink."
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:12.480]   But for me as a healthy individual with a properly functioning body, for me to go and
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.400]   sign up for Neuralink and say, "Let me just get started with this technology.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:21.520]   Let me always be the early adopter," is a very foolish way of making a decision.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:27.280]   So it's much wiser to be a little slow, to be a late adopter, and let technologies work
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   their way out and prove their way out.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:37.520]   So if somebody is 600 pounds and they have failed for 20 years at losing weight, bring
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.800]   on the Ozempic, right?
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.520]   Absolutely.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:46.480]   But if you've got an extra 15 or 20 pounds, then I think it would be crazy for you to
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:53.200]   try to treat that with a drug just from a pure, basic standpoint of risk versus reward.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.360]   Because you wouldn't be a severe acute case of somebody whose life is literally going
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.760]   to be…you're going to be dead in 10 years without this drug.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:07.440]   Now, that doesn't mean that there's another element to it as well.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:14.000]   And so when there's a drug available, people often go for what they see as the quick fix.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.760]   And as you alluded to, people do this with money, and they do this with physical drugs.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.880]   And so they say, "Well, look, here's this magic thing."
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:29.840]   I remember when I was in high school and I was fat, and I would read these ads and I
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.840]   would go and I bought these fat-burning powders and different things like that.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.240]   I was always looking for a quick fix.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.560]   I was looking for a way to try to get a quick result.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.880]   And all I did was burn money and take stuff that, you know, ephedrine and whatnot at the
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:50.800]   time that I have no idea what it did or didn't do to my body, and it wound up…and it didn't
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.320]   wind up with any long-term good.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:45:01.760]   And so it's really important, I think, to do a good detailed analysis of what actual…what
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:07.760]   if you're actually doing the fundamentals, if you're actually doing the fundamentals
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.880]   of life building and skill building.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   And so one of the things that I found interesting when I got older is I went back and I found
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.880]   some of my fat pics, like the before pictures that fat people take when they're going
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.000]   to go on a diet.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.040]   And I look back at them now with detachment, and I realized I wasn't actually all that
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:25.760]   fat.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.560]   I was just what today would be labeled as skinny fat.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.040]   I didn't have as much muscle as I should have had.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:36.960]   And if I had just found a way to build an active lifestyle and focused on building an
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.840]   active lifestyle, if I had become active, then all of the fatness that I was worried
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.000]   about and I was looking for drugs would have disappeared.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.760]   And the same thing applies then to money.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:54.560]   I had an experience a year or so ago where somebody was going on and on about how he
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.720]   was…he had invested with this thing, and he was going to make millions and millions
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.440]   of dollars.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:06.240]   And I asked him about it, and it was instantly…it was obvious to me that it was a Ponzi scheme.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.480]   And it was just a textbook Ponzi scheme.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.160]   And the guy's going on and on about all the millions that he's going to have in two
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.560]   months' time because of this incredible new thing that is being done.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.880]   And I just thought, like, this is so stupid.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:24.000]   This is such a stupid waste of time for you to be going down this pathway when you're
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.040]   not even doing the basics of good personal finance.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.080]   And maybe it's necessary that we all do that.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.920]   When I was in college, we all got involved in trading futures and doing orange juice
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:34.880]   futures and things like that.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.440]   Didn't have a clue what we were doing and went flat broke.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   And it's the same thing that maybe you just got to realize that it's better for you
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:46.480]   to take the long, hard path because it's much more predictable without necessarily
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.960]   denying that there may be performance-enhancing drugs that can help you at certain times,
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:56.640]   and there may be really great investments that come along at a certain time.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:02.480]   The people who gain the most from performance-enhancing drugs are not fat people sitting on their
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.200]   couch.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.440]   You know, a guy who's just fat and not going to the gym and starts taking Trend, all he's
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.280]   going to wind up with is terrible back knee, and he's not going to look any different.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.720]   He's going to destroy his heart and have terrible acne all over his back.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:23.120]   But the guy who's in the gym all the time and really has the fundamentals down, that's
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.800]   the guy who benefits from the performance-enhancing drugs, if that's his goal.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.320]   And you can do this in the mental space.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.560]   You know, I've never taken Adderall, but I've never used nicotine.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.680]   I've never taken Adderall.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:40.320]   But I wouldn't be opposed to somebody using those drugs, but they need to be used in
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   moderation in a specific application.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.280]   Or another example would be caffeine, right?
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:50.800]   I periodically stop using caffeine because I don't want to be addicted to anything.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:56.000]   And then we get to a point where the caffeine, just the usefulness of caffeine, wears off.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.120]   And if you are already doing the good stuff, if you already have good study habits, and
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.880]   you have good work habits, and you're really making progress on your goals, and then you
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:12.960]   want to use a nootropic, you want to use Adderall or some other nootropic or even just straight
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:20.160]   caffeine to get you through and to amp you up on just on a big project, to finish up
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:25.200]   a great project or get you prepared for an important presentation or something like that,
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:25.680]   then great.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.600]   That's a good use of a drug.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.920]   But it's not a good use of a drug on a standard thing.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:36.240]   If you go to the gas station where you are, I was in Arkansas a couple weeks ago, and
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.680]   I was filling up my car.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:44.640]   And there was a young redneck dude, probably 20 years old.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:49.120]   And he's coming out of the gas station with three Monster Energy drinks, getting ready
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:53.600]   to go and mow lawns all day.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.120]   And it's just kind of the classic thing.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:00.400]   It's happening to so many young people is that they're consuming enormous amounts of
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:00.960]   caffeine.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.840]   And they're doing it because they're not sleeping.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:08.560]   And it's a destructive thing that's ultimately going to lead to long-term problems.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.120]   It's not a good performance enhancer.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:17.680]   So any kind of enhancement, even from an investment perspective, I have no problem with people
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:24.320]   taking speculating on various investments, trading very aggressively and things like
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:24.480]   that.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.160]   I think that's all perfectly fine.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.600]   But the people who profit the best off of that are those who have all of the basics
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.400]   covered.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.800]   And then they take a portion of their portfolio and they speculate on something that could
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.240]   really work for them.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.720]   People who go after Get Rich Quick scheme don't generally wind up rich themselves.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.680]   It's just the sponsor of the scheme who winds up rich.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:53.760]   And I think the other aspect of it is that if you take the easy way, even when it works,
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.040]   there's two major problems.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.960]   You've always had what it takes to make it happen.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.520]   And we know the right tools can make it easier.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:06.560]   At Strayer University, we're always thinking about new ways to set you up for success.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.800]   That's why we give you a brand new laptop when you enroll in a bachelor's program.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.080]   So you can start off on the right foot and keep striving.

[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.000]   Strayer University certified to operate in Virginia by Shell.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:32.880]   When I was in high school, I knew a guy personally who had gotten super rich in the dot-com mania.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:38.560]   And he was a young guy, had built some random company that he had sold for and was involved
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.040]   in.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:45.360]   And he was in his early 20s driving a Porsche, doing awesome, going on and on about all of
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.800]   his wealth.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.680]   And I watched it.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:53.040]   And a year later, the dude was totally broke back working some just dead end job trying
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.000]   to pay his bills.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.760]   And Porsche was gone and everything was gone.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.680]   That was the earliest exposure I had to people making it big really quick.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:04.960]   And I realized the same principle that you can trace with lottery winners, that when
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.760]   people come into a windfall of any kind, if they haven't grown and they haven't become
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:15.040]   capable to handle the windfall, inevitably the windfall disappears because they didn't
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.280]   become the kind of person who could handle it.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.800]   And the way I like to say it is that the most important thing about becoming a millionaire
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.600]   is becoming a millionaire.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.840]   If you, if somebody dies and leaves you a million dollars and you don't think like a
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.760]   millionaire and you haven't had the hard one experience that comes from earning a million
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.280]   dollars yourself, there's a pretty decent chance that you won't be a millionaire for
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.040]   long because you yourself didn't become a millionaire.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.160]   That doesn't mean that you can't quickly become a millionaire.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.880]   So when I counsel people who come into a big windfall and here's a couple million dollars
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.600]   that I wasn't expecting, then I think that you can become a millionaire very quickly,
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.200]   probably a few years, a year, two years, three years.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.320]   But you have to become the millionaire and it doesn't happen just because you get these
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.040]   results.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.960]   And I would say the same thing that happens is this guy, some guy starts using steroids
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:12.080]   to improve his gym physique and he's doing it after he just spent six months in the gym.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.280]   I don't think he's ever going to mentally be as strong as the guy who's been in the
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:23.280]   gym for years and built his body the hard way, the slow way, getting slow results.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:27.520]   That guy's going to have a bulletproof psychology and he's going to be confident in who he is
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.800]   and what he's done.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.240]   And then if he adds steroids to that in the future, it's not going to affect him very
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:32.720]   much.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.000]   But the guy who comes in and he's six weeks in the gym and goes ahead and starts using
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.720]   steroids, that's going to mess him up psychologically because he knows he'll never know what it's
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.400]   like to not be fake.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.800]   And he'll always be insecure about that.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.720]   So that's how I would comment on it, to say that if somebody's in a dire circumstance,
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.440]   take drugs.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.000]   Absolutely take drugs to try to save a life.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.160]   There's no problem with that.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.720]   But if not in a dire circumstance, there's an enormous productivity to doing something
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.040]   the hard way because of the confidence that it builds in you.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.720]   You know, for not wanting to answer the question, you gave a really good answer to the question.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.160]   I appreciate that.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.440]   I asked the back half of that question.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.000]   Sure, go ahead.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:28.160]   So with your podcast yesterday, I got thinking, I'm within your demographic that you talk
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.320]   about with your podcast audience, except for I'm single.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.640]   I know you have a lot of families listening.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.920]   I'm 35.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.480]   I'm single.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:42.400]   I'm five foot eight and not, yeah, I have a few extra pounds, but I'm decently average,
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:48.240]   pretty decent looking with an above average income and above average savings.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.080]   That's except for the family part.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.680]   That's your demographic for your audience.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.000]   Sure.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.280]   One thing you mentioned yesterday is that when you're looking for a partner and you
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:02.880]   do want to get married, you should optimize for physical attractiveness.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:10.080]   One thing that when you're in your, when you've been working a while, you have saved.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:15.840]   Yeah, I've been in the gym, but there's various other options that are available
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.680]   to you when you have money to optimize for physical attractiveness.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:24.720]   There's various lists, hucks, augmentations.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:33.520]   How do you view that and surgeries or things like that in terms of
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.680]   optimizing yourself for physical attractiveness?
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:45.360]   I would give basically the same answer to it, meaning I don't have any particular reason
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:53.280]   to say that somebody shouldn't do, somebody shouldn't engage in some form of plastic surgery.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.560]   I've recommended it to people.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:01.040]   I have a child whose ears stick out kind of far and I've changed that child's hairstyle
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:06.400]   a little bit, but if it is something in the future and you can just get your ears tucked
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.680]   back and that helps you, then great.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.080]   I don't think it's that severe, but just saying that I don't think that's a problem
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:17.760]   to engage in plastic surgery or anything that you think could help you.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:24.000]   What I think the problem is exactly what I just described is simply that have you done
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.720]   the necessary kind of initial work.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:33.120]   So, I do think that you, if you want to marry, I think that it's important that you optimize
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:39.520]   attractiveness at every level, but it's important to be aware of what are the basic
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:44.400]   things that actually really are fundamental for attractiveness.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.160]   So, here would be an example.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:52.560]   The most attractive trait, I think, for men is generally confidence, personal confidence.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.800]   You can be a man and your body can look anything.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.600]   Your body can be, you know, any shape, any size.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:03.440]   You can have all kinds of wacky things "wrong" with you.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:09.360]   But if you are a confident person and you just express this self-confidence, you're
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:16.080]   ambitious, you know where you're going, then that, I think, is probably the fundamental
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.680]   thing that is the most attractive to women.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.600]   So, that's the first thing to focus on.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.200]   Then let's say that your ears, let's say you have one ear that sticks out and one
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:27.920]   ear that doesn't.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:34.640]   Then the second thing after just like personal confidence would be to come back and say,
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.680]   "Well, are you in shape?"
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:42.560]   You know, if I'm coaching you and I'm saying, "How can you attract a really high-quality
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:48.800]   wife?" then I think assessing your fashion and all of those things are really important.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.280]   But what's funny about fashion is that if you're in great shape, if you're strong,
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.360]   if you're muscular, if you're athletic, you can put on any clothes and they all look
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.320]   good on you.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:04.400]   But if you're fat and lumpy, then you can spend a thousand dollars on some fancy duds
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.480]   and it just doesn't look very good on you.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:11.360]   And so, trying to optimize for the most important thing is personal confidence, then trying
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.680]   to get in as much shape as possible.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.960]   Then you go and you say, "You know what?
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.240]   I got this one ear that sticks out and the other ear is not so much and I go and see
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.640]   a plastic surgeon and see if I can get my ear tucked in."
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.680]   Sure, fine.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.200]   You know, go ahead and get it tucked in.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.520]   And that may be something that improves your confidence.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:30.960]   It's not that you have to do one thing or another.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.520]   So, let's say you're going to the gym and you're working out and you're counting
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:40.720]   your calories and you're counting your macros and making progress, then does that mean that
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:44.480]   you can't go ahead and buy new clothes and then feel better because you don't look
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.040]   like a bum?
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.240]   No, it doesn't.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:50.640]   You can do all of these things simultaneously and there's no reason not to do them basically
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.000]   simultaneously.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.080]   But don't go down the pathway where you think, "Well, you know what?
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.880]   I'm 30 pounds overweight and I dress like a slob, but if I just had, you know, I don't
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.600]   know, a tummy tuck or whatever, that would make a difference."
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:10.080]   No, don't do an 80/20 analysis and say, "What are the 20% of things that if those
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.320]   were right would solve all the difference?"
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.640]   And in terms of optimizing for attractiveness, everything matters.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.960]   The most important thing is building confidence and having and expressing confidence.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:25.680]   And we could talk about how to do that, but that's the fundamental thing.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.840]   And then becoming as strong and as athletic as you are capable of being, which also feeds
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.960]   into confidence.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.640]   Those are the 20% of things that give you 80% of the results.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.520]   Then you add on the clothes and you add on charisma and you practice, you take some dancing
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:47.120]   lessons and you kind of do those other things, then those will all add in and help you to
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.080]   feel more confident.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:53.520]   But don't think that if you just pay a plastic surgeon to cut off the end of your nose that
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.760]   somehow that magically changes anything.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.280]   That's that would be how I would approach it.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.680]   Perfect.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.080]   Great.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.600]   And thank you for expounding on the question.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:10.000]   I didn't think that those two would lead into each other, but after listening to your podcast,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.680]   I thought, well, let's ask that second half of the question to find out.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.880]   So thank you.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.000]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.800]   And I would just say, I mean, obviously I don't know anything about you, your situation.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   I would just say that if you do want to get married and in line with kind of the most
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.200]   recent podcast that I did, you need to, I'll do another podcast.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:32.960]   Probably I'm planning to do another podcast in the coming days where I'll go over this
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.040]   specific question in a little bit more detail.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:42.320]   But what I want you to know is that it comes down to number one, who you are and do you
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:51.200]   have the expression, do you express the characteristics and qualities that are attractive to someone
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.840]   who you would consider to be an ideal wife?
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.080]   So you need to have those characteristics and qualities and they need to be expressed.
[00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.040]   So that's the first thing.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.720]   And then it's just a numbers game.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.240]   And so what, because there's two things that can be true.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.960]   You can be a guy who's just full of self-confidence and totally jacked and you dress like you're
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.680]   on the cover of a fashion magazine and everything is great and you have all the money in the
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.920]   world and all the income and you sit in your house and you don't ever meet women.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   Well, it ain't going to work, right?
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:27.200]   On the other hand, you could be out there meeting 20 new women a week and none of them
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.720]   say yes when you ask them on a date.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:34.880]   And now we know, hey, there's something fundamentally wrong with the basic attractiveness you have
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.680]   or the character that you have and your ability to express it.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.520]   So both of those are important.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:46.880]   You want to cultivate the characteristics and traits that are going to express attractiveness
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:52.720]   and then calculate how many opportunities you have for that and take a look at that
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.520]   and then just see which of these needs to be optimized.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:02.880]   Chances are it's probably more on option B than it is on option A, because you probably
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.920]   are just a normal attractive guy.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.280]   But what often happens is that men don't actually set a goal to get married and they don't go
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.440]   out and they don't go meet women, they don't try, they don't do it, and then they sit around
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.640]   and wonder why year after year after year they continue to be single.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.400]   So just calculate both of those things.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.240]   They should be optimized, but there's two sides of the equation.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.680]   We go to Mava in Texas.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.400]   Mava, welcome to the show.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.280]   How can I serve you today?
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.440]   Hi, Joshua.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.880]   Thanks for taking my call.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:36.720]   I'm just interested to follow up on a question I asked last week, given that I put a little
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:44.560]   bit more thought into your response and just it helped to verbally express what it is that
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.600]   I've been thinking about.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:55.360]   So just as a quick summary, kind of a working mom versus full-time mom comparison, and you
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.600]   expounded on that quantitatively and then also qualitatively.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:08.000]   And I think kind of with the three options you presented, you know, mother being a caregiver,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.520]   daycare, or a third option, just kind of with my situation have actively explored and participating
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:21.360]   in the third option, which is conducive to like a fully remote role and just kind of
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.520]   the lifestyle that my family currently has.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:31.280]   But I think what you said that resonated was not to decide now, but put a plan in place
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:38.800]   such that being a full-time parent at home and considering home education and similar
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.080]   kind of lifestyle would be possible.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.320]   So I just wanted to kind of explore that avenue further in terms of the plan in place.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:55.120]   And I think from, you know, a financial standpoint, I've consumed enough of a general personal
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:01.600]   finance content, including your podcast over the last like seven, eight years that the
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.760]   financial piece seems fairly understood and straightforward.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.440]   But thinking kind of in terms of what are my general, I hesitate to use such a strong
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:17.680]   word, but like reservations or what concerns me, what causes me to be afraid about being
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:25.440]   just kind of in the home instead of in the workplace kind of comes down to three main
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.320]   points.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.960]   So I'd be interested just to kind of hear your thoughts and how you would go about addressing
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:36.960]   these reservations that I have just from your perspective personally, but also just kind
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:46.320]   of being part of a homeschool, non-traditional, single income community seeing trends at large.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:54.480]   So my first concern is just kind of around losing intellectual trajectory because it's
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:03.920]   kind of stereotypical, but mom, kids at home, just not able to engage in continued growth.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:13.760]   And I really value just kind of engaging with ideas, engaging with other adults to explore
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.320]   ideas.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.960]   And that's really been helpful to have a professional setting to explore that, but just kind of
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.880]   thinking how to continue that if I was fully at home.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:29.760]   And then the second reservation is just kind of not wanting to land in a scarcity mindset,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.520]   because I know just thinking about the five points you have in approach to building wealth
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.640]   of increased income, decreased expenses, invest, avoid catastrophe, optimize lifestyle.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.520]   Like a lot of times the stay-at-home mom, the stay-at-home parent gets really obsessed
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.520]   with number two, decreasing expenses.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:56.000]   And I would say that I have a decent approach to optimize and know which expenses actually
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.760]   bring value to my life, but I just don't care for that mentality where you feel as though
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.080]   you can't make a difference on the top line.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:13.280]   So suddenly your impact for the family gets really invested on line two of just like decreasing
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.560]   expenses and of course supporting numbers three through five.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:23.680]   But basically just I have concerns about landing in a scarcity mindset kind of like financially
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:36.880]   or even just as an outlook as to what I bring or deliver, because I don't want to just get
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.920]   stuck there.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.280]   And then the third reservation would just be kind of, because I tend to be results oriented,
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:50.320]   a slight concern about starting to view children or home like as a project to, I don't know,
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:56.960]   optimize their education, try these different things with whether it be curriculum or learning
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:02.640]   styles or just something that becomes perhaps too intense where suddenly if I'm viewing
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:10.800]   too much of children's success like as a metric to be optimized, it becomes kind of oppressive
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:18.400]   or there's like a risk of losing relationship because my focus is very solely and squarely
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.360]   on my children.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:28.160]   So just curious what you would say maybe to each of those reservations or if you kind
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.160]   of have a broad response.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.120]   Appreciate your thoughts.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.880]   You're turning into one of my favorite callers.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.840]   I hope you'll keep this up because these are such useful and interesting questions and
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.040]   I really appreciate them.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:49.920]   First, with regard to losing the concern of basically losing intellectual engagement in
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:55.680]   terms of if you became a full-time mom, I think this is absolutely something to be cautious
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:00.720]   of and be aware of and to be asking the question, but it's relatively easily solved.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:08.640]   It's not going to be relatively easily solved at all times, but it's relatively easily solved
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.520]   if you have it as a specific goal.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.520]   So I have heard lots of full-time mothers complain about this and talk about this and
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.760]   say, "Well, I just spent all my time, all my day with children and where's my adult
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.320]   interaction?"
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:28.160]   And adult interaction, I think, is necessary.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.480]   It's something that is really good for you.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.520]   It's good for all of us.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:37.760]   I would say that in many ways, the same exact concern that you have is the same concern
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:42.400]   that I have and it's something just simply that relates to being an entrepreneur, being
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   a solopreneur, somebody who's fairly isolated because I work by myself in my home office.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.400]   It's the same basic risk.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:57.680]   Children can be demanding and there will be phases in life in which you really don't
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.120]   want to see anybody.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.480]   And so my wife, when she has a baby, she doesn't want to go anywhere.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.520]   She doesn't want to see anybody.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.800]   She just wants to be at home and be with her baby and I don't want to go and see anybody.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.320]   And so I wouldn't say to you, if you have a baby and you're at home for a month, that
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.200]   you should expect to go and engage with your intellectual engagement.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.560]   So that's what I'm trying to be honest, to say that you're probably going to be isolated
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.880]   and intellectually stultified at that period of life because your sleep schedule is all
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.040]   erratic and you're just happy to nest and be at home and not go anywhere, not see anybody,
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:33.760]   not do anything.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:40.080]   But that doesn't mean that when you have a six-month-old baby that you have no further
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.760]   intellectual engagement with the world.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.000]   So let's break intellectual engagement into two things.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.080]   The first thing is adult contact.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.480]   Do you have adult contact with other people?
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:58.560]   What I found really remarkable when I left my job was that I basically also left all
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.160]   my friends that were from that job.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.160]   And I think that's normal, but it was surprising to me.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.600]   I didn't expect it.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.040]   And so the first thing is just to probably squarely look in the eye and say that if I
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:16.240]   were to leave my job and be a full-time mom, most of the friends that I have at my job
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.520]   probably aren't going to continue to be my close friends.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.840]   Maybe it's easier for women.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:27.040]   I've observed some of the women in my life that they do have the ability to keep friendships
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.880]   more, maybe it's easier for women than it is for men, but in general, your reason for
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.200]   being friends with those specific people is probably your job and your workplace.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:44.240]   And so if the job and the workplace ends, then that ends some of that adult social contact.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:50.000]   But that doesn't mean that you can't bring adult social contact into your life.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:57.920]   How I would look at it would be to say that the time that you spend working at a job can
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.160]   also be viewed as an impediment to your social contact with adults.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:08.480]   And I think that if you had a vision for this as a mother, even if as a full-time mother,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:14.240]   if you had a vision for your social life, you can pack your schedule as full of social
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.360]   contact as you want.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:21.440]   The natural and obvious thing that often happens is you wind up building friendships and relationships
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.720]   with other mothers.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.240]   And so very commonly, I see mothers will have a play group.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:31.760]   They go to the park with their friends and everyone goes and sits at the park on Tuesday
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.520]   morning from nine o'clock to noon.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.760]   You go to the latte and play place and you get your latte with your girlfriends and the
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.840]   kids play on the play place and you enjoy contact that way.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.480]   So there's all kinds of opportunities that you have where you wind up interacting with
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:54.320]   other moms, moms of young children, because often there's an age banding to that.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.120]   Usually you would meet those moms.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.800]   They're all at the park probably now.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.240]   And so you just don't see them because you're at the office.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.200]   So it's not that hard to basically build friendships with people at your local park,
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.520]   at your local gyms, at your local activities.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:14.640]   A lot of times also a mother will have some kind of group of people that she meets from
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.760]   her local church.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.440]   Even if you don't attend a local church, a lot of churches will have various moms groups
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.880]   where they'll get together on Wednesday morning at nine o'clock and there'll be lots of other
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.360]   women.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.200]   And those are a great outlet because those other mothers have the same need and desire
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.880]   you have for adult contact.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:37.600]   In addition, I think that one of the things that I see is often not talked about is basically
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.440]   the idea of mother or wife as a socialite in our current era.
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.440]   Now, I don't know how much of this is true.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.080]   I'm stereotyping here just as an observation.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.920]   So I don't know how much of this is true.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:56.320]   But if you went back and you kind of thought of a stereotypical 1940s housewife, the way
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:04.640]   that she's viewed on some TV program or some book that you read, then the 1940s housewife
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.000]   often had a very, very active social life.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.560]   And you'll see things in a movie where Tuesday night, there's a bridge club at her home.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:18.640]   And on Thursday morning, she's down at the ladies charity relief service that she's being
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.600]   involved in.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.160]   And then on Friday night, she and her husband are hosting a cocktail party.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.280]   And then on Saturday, they're hosting an event at the local pool.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.320]   And you can just kind of expand from there.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:37.040]   But there's a whole element of wives and mothers being responsible for community events and
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:43.680]   creating community culture that has been lost because most women are now at their jobs.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.240]   And so if you're at your job all day, and that's where you're getting your social contact
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.960]   from, then it's an unusual woman who wants to host a Tuesday night bridge club or a Friday
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.560]   night cocktail party.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:02.960]   But if you are an active, energetic mother who wants to be more social, then you have
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.680]   the opportunity with your time being freed up to engage in more of those activities and
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.680]   to host more of those things.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.480]   And probably once you get your baby to, I don't know, six months old, six months old
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.400]   are pretty easy because usually by then they've, well, sometimes, as long as they're not sick,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.440]   I've had a bunch of sick babies.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.640]   So ideally, six month olds can be fairly easy.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.840]   They've kind of settled into the world.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.880]   They're no longer newborns.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.240]   They're strong and they're healthy, but they're not running around everywhere.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.960]   Then you can create those points of social contact and you can have time to do them more
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.920]   than you otherwise have time to do.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.480]   And so this is a big benefit.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:47.600]   I see this as a benefit for me as a husband is if my wife had a job and she had to go
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.880]   to a job every day, she's going to get off at five o'clock, then I don't feel good as
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.960]   a husband about saying to her, "Hey, let's have three families over on Tuesday night
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.280]   and let's have a nice meal for them."
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.120]   But if you don't have a job and you have the afternoon free and the day before and
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:10.160]   you can do meal prep and you can be a hostess, then it opens up the opportunity for your
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.800]   family social life to increase and to be more engaged because you're not tired from working
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.800]   all the time.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.840]   You're not stuck going to work every day.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:22.400]   And I think that you can do a lot of those things and they're depending on your lifestyle.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.960]   I mean, I've given the 1940s examples, in today's world, a lot of times, and we'll
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.040]   get to kind of homeschooling or home education in a moment, but a lot of times, a lot of
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.040]   moms will have a homeschool co-op and, "Hey, on Thursday afternoon, I'm going to have
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.280]   the homeschool co-op over and then we're going to have small group for our church.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.280]   We're going to host that on Wednesday night."
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:49.120]   There's just so many things that could be done if you're interested in socializing
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.400]   with other adults.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.200]   There are lots and lots of things that could be done by you when you have time that opens
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.600]   up and is freed up for you.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.480]   But most, again, I'm stereotyping, but it just seems to me because most women today
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:10.320]   have jobs, they don't have the time or the energy to engage in hosting people in their
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:17.920]   homes, nor do they have the time and energy to engage in the charity functions, all the
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:26.160]   community things that were once done by many women as far as building the base in the community.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.320]   So let me just go to community things as well.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   Impact or intellectual engagement doesn't have to only come from paid work.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.320]   I'm skeptical.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.640]   I mean, you might have a really intellectually engaging job, but most of us, our jobs become
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.240]   somewhat repetitive over time.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:53.360]   I think that in many cases, you would have opportunity for you to build more intellectual
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.360]   engagement with something that you care about if you have more time.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.080]   This is why people are often pursuing early retirement and financial independence.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.480]   They have these things they want to do if they have more time.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:11.640]   Well, if your husband was able to earn the income that your family needed, and you then
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:17.920]   had your time freed up, you've achieved an expression of financial independence.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.600]   No, you're not together living on the income from your investments.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.040]   But I'll tell you a secret, he's probably happier having a job to go to, and you probably
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.360]   are happier having your time now.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:34.120]   And you can then go ahead and engage in those intellectual engagements.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.680]   And so, I used to go to all these charity meetings and political clubs and socialite
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.600]   things all around Palm Beach, and I did it because I was prospecting for clients in my
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.400]   financial planning business.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.640]   And women are the cornerstone of those things.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.200]   Women are the activists of local organizations.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.680]   And what's cool about those kinds of opportunities, let's say that you have an issue that you're
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.720]   really passionate about, and you become a local activist for that issue, and you're
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.160]   hosting clubs and events, and maybe you're hosting breakfasts for a political candidate,
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.880]   or I don't know, whatever it is that you're doing, and you're really involved in those
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.280]   things, you'll get more actual socializing and actual intellectual engagement from those
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:17.600]   pursuits than you ever get with your current dozen co-workers that you interact with in
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.640]   the context of your profession.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.760]   But probably right now, you're not doing very much of that, because the job is an impediment
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.800]   to that kind of socializing.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:33.420]   In addition, if you really want to have intellectual engagement, I think that, and here I'm switching,
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:38.680]   to be clear, from social engagement, of socializing with other adults, to intellectual engagement.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:44.680]   If you want to have intellectual engagement, then I think that being a full-time mom is
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.040]   a really great way to do that.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.560]   Some of my favorite writers that I enjoy reading are full-time moms.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:18:00.280]   They're also academics and engaged in writing, but there's a good synergy between their family
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:03.160]   life and their intellectual pursuits.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   And so I see this with professionals who are writing books, there are people who write
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:13.840]   influential blogs, or write and publish essays frequently, there are people who are doing
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:19.160]   original research, I know a lot of women who do activism of various kinds, and they're
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.960]   engaging in activism, and it's all around their children's schedules.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.820]   Because that kind of work, and that kind of intellectual engagement can clearly be done
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:34.560]   with children involved, it just doesn't require them to go to an office outside the house
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.720]   for eight hours a day, and be there eight hours a day, every single day.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.160]   And so intellectually, you can have all kinds of intellectual engagement, and you can have
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.160]   all kinds of professional engagement around children.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:54.880]   Now I would just give one caution to say that I have found it very hard to see how, I don't
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:01.560]   know how moms run a business and take care of their children full-time.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:07.440]   I've tried this, I've tested this with my children, maybe if it's one or two children,
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.520]   maybe you can do it more easily, you can certainly do it more easily when you enroll your children
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.960]   in school, if you enroll your children in school when they're older, but the caution
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.200]   I would give is that don't expect to be running a business as a mom and think that you're
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.920]   going to be able to do six hours of productive work, because the way that the work changes,
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.120]   I don't think that being a mom is the hardest job in the world.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.680]   And I think that it's wrong for us to say that.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.800]   It's not the hardest job in the world.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:41.120]   What it is, however, is it's difficult because it is a continual, constant job.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:49.320]   And so, because you're responsible throughout the day, then you can't put together, right
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.840]   now I can go to my office and I can sit down in my office and I can spend eight hours alone
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.360]   and I can just get in the flow and the zone and just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.920]   When I'm with children, I can get 15 minutes here, I can get 20 minutes there, I can get
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:05.200]   an hour at naptime, but I can't get like five hours put together just because I told my
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.680]   children, okay, I'm going to go and work now.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:11.040]   And I think that's what's demanding about being a mom, is that you're on all the time
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:16.520]   and you're continually, you don't get that like focused mental time.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.720]   But if you can come up with activities that fit into that life and work, okay, I'm going
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.880]   to read an hour here on this subject, I'm going to browse, I'm going to do a few minutes
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:29.340]   of my Twitter feed here, 15 minutes here, I'm going to answer some emails there.
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.840]   You can insert this work into your workday.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:36.960]   Now, in addition to that, I think that if you were interested or became interested in
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:44.040]   home education, that I think a lot of home educators, I myself included, find that one
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:50.480]   of the most interesting things about having children is that you can fix your own educational
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.160]   deficits in your homeschooling.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.540]   Because now you get the chance to go through and teach them all the stuff and you get to
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.960]   learn a lot of stuff alongside them.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:03.180]   And I see this, my wife talks about this, about all the stuff that she's learned homeschooling
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:04.180]   our children.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:07.060]   I see this with all the stuff that I've learned about homeschooling our children.
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:10.620]   You can go through and you can read things alongside your children, you can learn things,
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:12.260]   you can find new applications.
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:17.220]   And I find home education to be very intellectually rewarding, especially if you're doing it in
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:21.360]   a serious manner and you're shooting for a high level education.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.660]   And so even if I don't think the right model is to think that you, the model of home education
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:29.460]   that I think is incorrect is to think that somehow you have to teach your children all
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:30.980]   the stuff, you don't.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:35.820]   Your job is to be a facilitator, but you can read along with them, you can read to them,
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:36.820]   you can be looking through their books.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:40.860]   And if you choose a really challenging curriculum for your children's home education, you'll
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:47.500]   learn more from that curriculum than you ever did from your own schooling back in the day.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:52.740]   So it is important to plan for losing social contact with other adults, but that can be
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:58.020]   planned with actually proactively going for it.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.300]   And intellectual engagement is just a choice.
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:06.260]   Either you disengage and you just become the person who's not engaged or you keep intellectual
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.940]   engagement as part of your life and your lifestyle.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.880]   And I think that it's perfectly possible to be very socially connected with other adults
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.980]   and highly intellectually stimulated, even if you were a full-time mom.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:18.980]   I'll pause there.
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.860]   What are your thoughts on that, on my answer to your first question?
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:27.580]   Yeah, I think that was a helpful overview.
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:32.660]   You basically were outlining points about looking to history, for example, there's no
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:40.340]   need to reinvent and that maybe even my skew or thought about a stereotype of losing adult
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:51.220]   contact is kind of exposed to because I am occupied during business hours and not aware
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.220]   of what else is happening.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:56.380]   So I think exploring those avenues, thinking about it intentionally, exploring it before
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:23:05.180]   necessarily committing, deciding or exiting the workforce is a good avenue to kind of
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:10.180]   just kind of remove some of the concerns I have.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:14.700]   And so those are good avenues to explore, appreciate those thoughts.
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.700]   Good.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:21.300]   What you have right now is financial freedom because you have a high income.
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:24.460]   What you don't have right now is time freedom.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:29.220]   If you did choose to become a full-time mother, you would give up a measure of your financial
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:35.340]   freedom of the excess income, the extra disposable income that you're earning from your salary.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.020]   But what you would gain would be time freedom and time control.
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:42.820]   So I want to be honest to say you don't get total time freedom because now you're caring
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.300]   for a child.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:47.840]   And so that structures your life in a certain way.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.460]   But you do have full control over how you use your time.
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:55.980]   And children can be easily integrated into life.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.860]   And so you could, if you're the kind of person, if you're the kind of woman who is motivated
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:08.860]   to be socially connected to others, you can have a much more active social life than you
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:16.060]   have right now as you engage in it and as you build your skills.
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:23.220]   And so the reason I say skills is that as a parent, you do acquire some different skills.
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.580]   So I take my children out to eat all the time.
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:26.580]   You've got a baby.
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.220]   I've got a 15-month-old baby.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.540]   There are many times where I need to sit the baby next to me, sit the baby on my lap, and
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:34.780]   I have to carry on a conversation while listening to four other children and just making sure
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.300]   that everything is okay.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.300]   That's a skill that you develop.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:41.780]   And then before you have children, I always, when I'm with single people, I'm like, listen,
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.300]   you've got my full attention.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:46.020]   Just because I'm looking and listening to four other people doesn't mean my attention's
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.220]   not on you.
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.180]   And so you'll observe that you'll build those skills naturally.
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.180]   They'll be acquired.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:54.940]   But you can have a very, very active social life if you want it.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:25:00.460]   And you can, and I would also say that you can do this really beautifully as you build
[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:01.460]   a network.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:06.280]   Let's pretend that you couldn't pay a babysitter, but you still wanted to engage in an active
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.280]   social life.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.540]   Well, when you have time freedom, you can have a thing where on Tuesday morning, every
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:15.260]   other Tuesday morning, I've got my girlfriend who lives across town who's got a two-year-old
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.620]   and I've got a baby.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:20.160]   She's going to come over here and bring her baby one Tuesday morning, and the next Tuesday
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.740]   morning I'm going to swap with her, and that's going to be my morning where I go to my favorite
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:28.380]   Pilates class and have a latte by myself at Starbucks on my way home.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:31.580]   She's going to take care of my baby for two or three hours while I go and do that.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:32.580]   And there's one thing.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:36.620]   Oh, by the way, let's just go ahead and visit for an hour or two after I get back, after
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:39.540]   each of us gets back, and we'll swap that out every other Tuesday.
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:44.380]   On Wednesday, I'm going to have my mom come over and take care of the children at lunchtime.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:49.380]   Just be here for an hour or two, feed them lunch and play with them while I go and have
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:52.060]   lunch with my former coworkers every Wednesday.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:56.820]   And then on Thursday night, we're going to invite people over from church, or that's
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:57.980]   going to be our hosting night.
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:00.660]   So every Thursday night, there's going to be someone coming over.
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:05.900]   And my point is that you can do this if you have the motivation and the vision for it.
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:11.660]   You can do it without spending money on it, and you can have access to childcare, and
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:15.460]   you can have access to social contact.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:20.080]   It's totally doable if you have the vision for it and the desire for it.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.560]   The reason I keep emphasizing if you have the desire for it is that some moms, they
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.940]   just do well in a kind of an isolated environment.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:31.380]   And they find that they're so focused on, you know, I'm doing all my homeschooling,
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.700]   I don't want to go and socialize all the time.
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:37.780]   And so not all women do this, but it's not because they couldn't, it's often because
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.800]   they don't want to at this particular phase in life.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:46.160]   Moving on to the second question you asked, of not wanting to land in financial scarcity.
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.880]   Two things occur to me.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:54.220]   Number one, I don't know about the nature of your husband's income.
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:59.940]   And I don't particularly want to ask, I just want to say that one of the things that many
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:10.540]   men find is that when they don't have to think about managing two careers, the opportunities
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:13.900]   that they have are much bigger.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:17.740]   I can't guarantee it, because if your husband just has a straight up job, and okay, he has
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:23.820]   a job, and he's not going to change, and he's going to get cost of living raises, and he's
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:28.740]   not super aggressive about building his income, or anything like that, fine.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:36.340]   But I think in general, if you put a dual income, two people together, and you contrast
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:42.420]   that with a motivated man whose wife is a full-time mother, I think the motivated man
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:49.500]   will often, can often wind up earning much more money, because of his freedom to go after
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.420]   bigger opportunities.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:54.340]   So let's say that he was offered a promotion.
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:59.500]   Well, if you've got a job, and you live in Dallas, and he lives in Dallas, and he's offered
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:05.060]   a promotion to move to Washington D.C., if you have a dual income couple, then you've
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:09.100]   got to negotiate that between two jobs, and it becomes a real tussle.
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:10.100]   What about my career?
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.100]   What about my job?
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.380]   What am I going to do in Washington D.C.?
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:17.860]   If you have one job, then it just comes down to, is this the right move for our family,
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.620]   for our social contact, for our children?
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:25.020]   And if you want to pick up and move to Washington D.C., you pick up and move to Washington D.C.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:29.340]   In addition to that, especially if you have children, the problem that dual income families
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:33.980]   face with children, is they're always trying to split all of the parental duties right
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:36.300]   up the middle to keep it fair and equitable.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.740]   And so, okay, you pick up the children from daycare on Monday, and you've got to be there
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:43.700]   at 5.05 to pick them up, otherwise we get charged extra if we're late.
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.700]   And I'll pick them up on Tuesday, and you pick them up on Wednesday.
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:53.060]   And so, your husband's at the office on Monday afternoon, and there's a big meeting and a
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:56.820]   big client opportunity, and someone says, "Hey, why don't you come to dinner with us?
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:58.140]   I'm meeting so-and-so big shot."
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:02.100]   "Oh, no, I can't, because I've got to go and pick up the baby from daycare.
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.560]   And I can't do that, because then my wife will be mad at me, because this was her night
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.900]   that I'm supposed to go pick up the baby from daycare."
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.220]   There's an enormous pressure.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:16.380]   Now, I don't want husbands to ignore their wives or be not present or anything like that.
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:21.780]   There are times in a man's career, however, where if he has the mental freedom to pour
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:27.740]   on the work during a period of time, because he knows that his wife and his children are
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:33.460]   taken care of, then he can make much bigger moves and get much farther ahead in his career
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.460]   quicker.
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:41.980]   I'm not convinced that it's just an automatic given that we'll always have lower income
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.300]   because a mom becomes a stay-at-home mom.
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:48.140]   I think in some cases, and I don't want to say many, because I can't prove many, but
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:49.740]   I'll just say some.
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:56.100]   In some cases, being freed up as a man to really go after your career without having
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:00.980]   to try to simultaneously negotiate with your wife around her career and negotiate about
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.780]   who's going to take care of the children, and I've got to go on this business trip and
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:04.820]   all these other things.
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:09.920]   It allows you to make potentially bigger moves and to go farther faster.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:15.860]   If you look at the most successful businessmen in America, it's very unusual to find them
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:18.460]   being a dual income family.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:25.540]   It's very common that the most financially successful men will have a full-time wife
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:30.020]   so that they know my children are well cared for, my wife is well cared for, and I can
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:35.540]   focus on the money and I can make a lot more of it because of my freedom.
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:40.620]   I view this as an enormous benefit for me as a husband and as a man.
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:47.780]   I view the fact that my wife doesn't have a job as an enormous asset rather than a financial
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:53.220]   liability because it frees me up to be able to travel if I need to, to be able to go after
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:57.580]   opportunities, to work early and late when I need to, to take spur-of-the-moment meetings.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:03.340]   I would not make as much money as I do if we were both earning an income and then trying
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:11.380]   to negotiate our parental responsibilities evenly down the middle to try to handle things.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:17.180]   One thought on finances is that you may wind up, in the fullness of time, if your husband
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:21.540]   has a career that offers him where there's opportunity, and if he's making, if I remember
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:25.140]   he's right, a couple hundred thousand dollars, there's clearly opportunity, you may wind
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:30.360]   up four years from now having a much higher household income than you do today because
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.380]   he has additional flexibility.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:36.520]   I can't guarantee it, but I would say it's a strong possibility.
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:43.400]   On the flip side also is that you are, depending on your professional training and your interests,
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:50.500]   I think that you can massively contribute to your family's finances in ways that go
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:57.440]   far beyond clipping coupons and cutting costs, especially if you hone your skills or have
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.140]   any interest in doing things like managing your family's investments.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:07.060]   One of the great problems that dual-income couples face is generally, both of them are
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:10.940]   always focused on their jobs and always focused on their careers and they just got to make
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.700]   more money, make more money.
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:19.460]   And so because of the cost of working, generally expenses are higher than they otherwise need
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:24.020]   to be, and generally there's very little time available for focusing on investments and
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.060]   finding good investments.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.700]   In the beginning that's okay, but as your family accumulates capital, it becomes much
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:34.860]   more important that you manage the capital effectively to make good investments than
[01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:37.660]   that you make more money.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:45.180]   And so looking at your $120,000 income, you have an income amount that is being reduced
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:50.060]   by taxes, you could probably save some money by running your family's budget efficiently
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:54.820]   because you have time to take over the finances of the management of the budget and make sure
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:59.340]   that we've got all the best packages and all of our expenses are as low as possible.
[01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:04.500]   But if you also focus on developing interest and expertise in investment management and
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:09.980]   you manage your family's investments, you can contribute to your family in an enormous
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:11.420]   amount.
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:18.100]   The most common way I see this is if a husband has a business and his wife does real estate,
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:19.780]   that's a very, very common thing.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:24.660]   A lot of times she'll get a real estate license and because she may sell a couple of houses
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:28.620]   a year just from personal contacts, especially if she's very social, you can take the baby
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:32.160]   with you to a lot of stuff, you can work the work around some of the other things.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:36.060]   But more importantly, if you become the one who's finding the real estate, finding the
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:41.100]   deals, managing the tenants, managing the contractors, managing the investments, you
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:44.660]   can get really great performance out of an investment portfolio.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:51.260]   If you're interested in other avenues of investing and you become Ms. Crypto or Ms. Airdrop
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:59.200]   or Ms. whatever, gold coin collector, whatever it is, you can start to develop and exercise
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.540]   knowledge in ways that you can't right now.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:08.260]   And so I think that if you're interested in the family's overall financial well-being,
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:11.900]   that you can contribute enormously even if you're not generating income.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:16.540]   And what I love about this is and then that's to say nothing finally, that's to say nothing
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:21.380]   of you having a business of your own as well that you manage.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:28.580]   And so I really get annoyed if I am counseling a couple where they're a dual income couple
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:31.020]   with both of them earning W2 income.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:34.380]   That is the least efficient way to build wealth in the United States.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:35.820]   You're highly taxed.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:45.020]   You have no time freedom and the lack of time freedom means you can't find inefficiencies
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:48.940]   in investment markets, whatever markets you're interested in to exercise.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:56.060]   My favorite is to have one high income because that gives you stability of income that can
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:35:00.220]   be useful for borrowing ability just for stable financial management.
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:05.220]   And then to have you be the one who manages the contractors of the rehab, the flip house
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:11.180]   that you guys are working on and finds the next deal and builds a little business that
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:15.460]   you know we have a build a little very tax friendly business that gives you guys the
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:20.700]   ability to sink to have a whole bunch of deductions for things that you enjoy doing anyways.
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:24.940]   So there's a lot of opportunities that go much beyond cost cutting that if you're motivated
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:28.500]   to pursue, you could pursue that would enhance your family's financial standing.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:29.500]   Appreciate your thoughts.
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:42.860]   Just to kind of think of what works with lifestyle and vision, I guess it kind of comes back
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:43.860]   to vision.
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:46.140]   That's kind of the theme.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:52.580]   Kind of have some idea of what I might be interested in and actively explore it to kind
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.860]   of address some of these concerns that I have.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:58.420]   Thanks for sharing those thoughts.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.420]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.420]   My pleasure.
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:01.420]   Now to number three.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:02.420]   You said, "Okay.
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:03.420]   Well, I don't want to be this like hyper focused.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:08.660]   I'm going to use the term tiger mom who's just all obsessed with how my child is doing
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:12.780]   and you need to do just a little bit better and we need to raise your IQ just a little
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.700]   better and blah, blah, blah."
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:19.140]   I would say that my answer to this is just the fact that you're concerned about that
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:22.180]   means you're not going to be that.
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:26.840]   On the contrary, I think it's much more important that you be the kind of really engaged mother
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:29.740]   that your children ultimately will need.
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:33.300]   You've probably listened to my series on how to invest in your child.
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:36.780]   I think that ... Now, I don't know.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:41.740]   Time will tell because some psychologists just basically say, "None of it matters.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:44.020]   It's all innate characteristics and blah, blah, blah.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:47.500]   Here's all the evidence that parental input really doesn't make any difference.
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.420]   How you're born is how you're born."
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:53.820]   I don't really believe it, although I'm sensitive to their data and I don't believe it.
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:57.880]   I think you can make an enormous difference in your child's long-term outcomes.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:03.400]   That's why I really want moms to be engaged.
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.480]   I want you to feel like you do have a mission.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:12.040]   I want you to be on a mission for your children and I want you to engage in that fully.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:18.480]   I think that there is enormous evidence on basically everywhere you look of the power
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:24.240]   that you as a mother have in the long-term outcomes that your children experience.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.760]   Everything from the bonding that you have with a baby and the importance of breastfeeding
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.440]   in your baby's long-term outcomes and just the engagement and the play and the character
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.440]   formation and the vocabulary formation and the intellectual ability that you can instill
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:37.440]   and everything.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:41.920]   It just goes on and on and on of the things that can be done.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:50.080]   I would say that could you be too obsessed with the outcomes that your children are having?
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.700]   Yeah, you probably could.
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:55.840]   I would say that probably the best solution to that is have three babies.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.960]   Because if you have one and it's all about my one little precious and you're just hyper-focused
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.480]   on that one baby, then you could probably smother your one baby.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:08.040]   If you have three children, then you're probably not going to smother the one because you're
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.960]   too busy managing three.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.460]   You can still make enormous progress.
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:20.920]   But on every single metric, an involved parent, we don't know where the limits of human capacity
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.920]   are.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.080]   So, I have proved and am proving this in my experiments.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:31.760]   I'm probably more obsessed with this than you could ever be and testing this and trying
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.680]   that and doing this and let's see what this outcome could be.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:41.080]   But on basically every level, if you care about your child's physical formation, you
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.360]   can have the healthiest athlete in the world.
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:48.080]   If you care about your child's academic performation, he can finish a master's degree by the time
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:49.560]   he's 19 years old.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:56.080]   If you care about your child's social life, he can have friends on every continent.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.880]   There's no limit to what's available.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:04.480]   And I think that your children are enormously privileged when you can create that kind of
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.640]   environment for them and you can be their coach.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:11.080]   You can be the person who's digging into the research and who's doing it.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.240]   And I think we need more of that.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:17.120]   And so, if you become hyper obsessed with it, my only comment would be create an outlet
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.120]   for it.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.400]   So, I'll read your mom blog.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.400]   I love mom blogs.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.080]   I'll read everything that you're doing and I'll try to learn from them and try to apply
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.080]   them.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:33.240]   But our children are our future and I believe personally that motherhood specifically, fatherhood
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:40.720]   also, I believe that motherhood is a noble calling and that you can accomplish that the
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:44.360]   world needs your children.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:49.480]   And I mean that on a physical sense, that the world needs your babies.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:54.480]   And I mean that on the sense that the world needs your children and the world needs you
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:01.240]   to be engaged with them and productive so that they become pillars of society.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.720]   Our children are the asset that we most need.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:11.680]   And you know, I stole that line from my mom because she used to have a lot of children
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:18.480]   and people would make nasty comments to her that anybody with big families always hears.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.780]   And her answer, which is remarkable because she's a very humble woman and usually not
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:26.720]   this snarky, but I don't know how many times she actually said it, but she said, you know,
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:30.840]   the answer I finally settled on is just simply the world needs my children.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:38.760]   And I'm talking to you right now because of my mother and the work that she did for me.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:45.120]   And she is enormously responsible for who I am.
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:49.600]   She's not a perfect mother, but I'm grateful for her labor in my life.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.320]   And to the extent that I have the opportunity to be here speaking to you at the moment,
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:41:02.480]   I owe an enormous portion of that to my mother and I honor her for my life.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:07.360]   And the idea to me that somehow, this is why I don't like to tell women that they shouldn't
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:08.360]   have jobs.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.920]   I don't feel like that's my place.
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.000]   That's up to them and their husbands to work it out.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.540]   But I do want to really solidly, solidly represent the fact that not all important work is measured
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.940]   in dollars.
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:25.200]   If my mom needed money, there's not a limit to how much I would give her.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:29.320]   If my mom were in need, there's no limit to that.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:36.360]   And I look at my mom at 80 years old with her six children and her 16 grandchildren.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:45.700]   And as far as I can tell, she has an enormous reward for her years and years of labor.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:57.680]   And it seems to me much more satisfying for her to have the joy of that than if she had
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:01.160]   earned whatever she would have earned through her working lifetime.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:04.320]   My mom did take a job.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:08.060]   So when my parents were younger, my dad was in the Navy.
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.600]   He was gone for six months at a time.
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:13.200]   And so she didn't have an income at that point in time.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.200]   She was trained.
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.600]   She had a training and certification.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.600]   She has a college degree.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.960]   She was a trained teacher.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.160]   And then they had children.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.080]   My parents were missionaries abroad and they had children.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.560]   And she was raising with small children.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:28.720]   And there was a point in time at which they decided they didn't want to continue homeschooling.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.680]   And so she took a job at the local private Christian school in order to get the tuition
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.820]   reduction for my family.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:38.200]   She worked that job while all of us worked our way through.
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:43.320]   And then after they didn't need the tuition reduction anymore, then she came back and
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:46.320]   was a full-time wife and mother again.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:49.040]   And that was the time that she had a job.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.040]   My point, what I'm saying is that, so it's not that I don't think that you can't have
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.040]   a job.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:57.880]   And you're having a job may be strategically useful and helpful and important.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:05.040]   But the impact that you can have at your job can be measured in one dimension.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.960]   The impact that you can have as a mother can be measured in a different dimension.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.040]   And if you did become very results-oriented and focused on your children as a project,
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.340]   I don't see that as a bad thing.
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:22.800]   And if you're too weird about it, then someone will correct you and you'll recognize, "Hey,
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.640]   I don't want to be that weird."
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.640]   On the contrary, I think that work is really important.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:31.000]   And it's to be honored.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.240]   I honor you if that's the path that you go down.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:39.920]   And your children will honor you if that's the path that you go down, as I honor my mother.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:46.600]   And I think that this is the best way I can express what I want to say on it, is that
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:57.840]   our society has broadly settled on financial earnings as the basic metric of value in life.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:07.360]   And our society has broadly brainwashed our daughters and young women into unidimensionally
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.760]   calculating their value based upon their income.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:18.960]   And I wish to push against that and say that income for any person, man or a woman, is
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:25.360]   a very thin measure of value, and that we have lost something enormously important in
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.960]   our society.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.520]   We've lost babies, as the show that I released yesterday shows.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:35.320]   We've lost babies, and our society, our population around the world is collapsing.
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:39.760]   We've lost social integration, social cohesion.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:44.800]   We've lost all of the important work that women once did of engaging in their communities
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.360]   and solving problems.
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:51.920]   Women, traditionally speaking, even today you see it in voting rates and in activism
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:57.320]   in organizations, but women are the ones who get things done in their communities.
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:05.200]   And our communities are hollowed out because many of our women are sitting in a cubicle
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:10.160]   making their boss rich instead of making their community better.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:14.340]   And so our communities suffer for it, and our families are suffering for it.
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:21.080]   And so I think that if you and your husband, between you guys, if you go down that path,
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:27.060]   it's something that is worthy of honor and respect, and you can feel proud of your work.
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:32.760]   And while you don't have the same metric as making more money than your girlfriend, I
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:39.720]   think that if you imagine yourself at 80 years old able to reflect back on your life and
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:45.180]   see your children happy, healthy, married with children of their own, you see your grandchildren,
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:49.280]   you look at your community where you have impacted this issue, that issue that's important
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:53.000]   to you, you've engaged with people, you see the people's lives, even just in terms of
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.320]   personal ministry towards people.
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:00.920]   There are people all around you that are hurting, who are hungry, literally hungry, who are
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.440]   hurting, who are homeless.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:08.920]   And I've watched my mother pour out her life taking care of people her entire life.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:18.640]   And at the recent family camp that I hosted, I brought my parents to that.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.640]   And in the context of kind of our closing event, my dad was sharing a story.
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:30.680]   And throughout my lifetime, I watched my parent host at least, I don't know, I would say 30,
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:36.560]   but maybe that's too many, more than 20, certainly more than 20 people who I've watched my mother
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.720]   care for in various capacities throughout her lifetime.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:47.080]   And so the point is to measure your life not exclusively with financial income, but to
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:51.600]   measure it more broadly and then make whatever choices seem appropriate for your family at
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:52.880]   this point in time.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.440]   So that would be my closing remarks.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.440]   Thank you for the questions.
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.200]   I appreciate it.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.160]   That wraps up today's Friday Q and A show.
