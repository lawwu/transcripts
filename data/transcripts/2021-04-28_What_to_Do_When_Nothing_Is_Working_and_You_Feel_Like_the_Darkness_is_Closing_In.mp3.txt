[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.960]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:29.760]   Today on the show, I would like to share with you what to do when nothing is going well.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.920]   You may hear a little bit of strangeness, a little bit of nasal congestion in my voice.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.680]   I will try to keep some sniffing and snorting off of the audio, but it's possible that a
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.320]   sniffer snort might pass through.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.640]   I've got Kleenexes here on my desk.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880]   But I am not feeling very well right now.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.000]   I'm physically not feeling very well at the moment, and the last couple of weeks have
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.640]   been really personally difficult for me.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.480]   There's no catastrophe, no crisis, nothing that you need to send me any condolences about,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.560]   just simply that it's just been difficult.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.240]   And there have been a number of things.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.280]   Well, it just it feels like everything is going wrong.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.520]   It feels like there's this black cloud everywhere that is kind of affecting everything.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.080]   Now obviously that's hyperbole, but that's just how it feels sometimes.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.160]   I've been physically sick off and on over the last couple of weeks, allergies, sometimes
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.720]   something a little bit more.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.040]   My wife has been a little bit sick.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.040]   We wondered if it was COVID.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.960]   I kind of hoped it was COVID so we could get it over.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.600]   As far as I know, we haven't had COVID yet, but I don't know.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.120]   We're going to go get a COVID test in a couple of days and see what that results have been.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.160]   Nothing serious, no serious symptoms, just a little bit of sickness.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.280]   Business I'm behind on most of my goals, behind on most of my business plans, not exactly
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.320]   sure how to press forward, a little bit overwhelmed on a lot of different fronts right now.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.480]   And I think things are okay.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.440]   My kids are fine.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   Most things are fine on that level, but when things aren't going well, it can feel pretty
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.160]   black.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.000]   Everything can feel pretty dark.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.760]   I tend to be a fairly emotional person, pretty in tune with my own emotions, pretty subject
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.920]   to them.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.120]   And throughout my own short lifetime, I've had so many ups and downs that I've learned
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.240]   pretty well how to deal with it.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.400]   And so what I want to do today is supplant some of the programming that was scheduled
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.520]   and just talk to you about some of the things that I personally do when things aren't going
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.600]   well.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.920]   And I hope that these ideas may be useful to you because I've been here before.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.040]   I know I'll be here again.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.800]   It's a fairly regular occurrence in my lifetime.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.280]   And I thought you might appreciate a few ideas that would be helpful.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.320]   So I want to talk about your mind, your mental state.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.480]   I want to talk about your body.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.840]   I want to talk about kind of some of the things that I do when things aren't going very well
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.560]   in hopes that these tools will be helpful for you.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.600]   The first thing I would comment on, if you're someone who regularly experiences down days,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.520]   difficulties, times when you're just frustrated, when you're struggling, when things aren't
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.960]   working, when the blackness is closing in, first thing that I always think of is I've
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.240]   been here before.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.600]   And as I get older, more and more, this is something that brings me a significant amount
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   of comfort.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.560]   And you've probably been here before.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.600]   Now if you're listening to me and you're 16 years old and you're facing your first kind
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.360]   of minor life catastrophe where it feels like nothing is going well, even though it should
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.220]   be, then welcome.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.220]   Welcome to the club.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.640]   This is how it works for most of us.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.520]   But for me, I've gained tremendous comfort in the fact that I have been here before.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.240]   No matter what the problem is, at this point in time, I've experienced so many problems,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.600]   so many trials, so many hardships, so many setbacks in my life that I am getting increasingly
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.800]   comfortable with those problems and those trials and those setbacks.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.600]   I personally try not to talk much about them publicly just because I don't think anybody
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.840]   really cares.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.480]   I don't care to hear much about any other people's problems and so I don't share many
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.760]   of my problems publicly.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.720]   But I wanted to do it today just to tell you, if you think that this is some kind of strange
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.040]   thing, if you think that other people don't go through difficult times, you're wrong.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.440]   We all do.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.960]   And so I gain a tremendous amount of comfort of recognizing that I've been here before.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.800]   And because I've been here before, I've developed some of the techniques and the tactics that
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.080]   I'm going to share with you in today's show that helped me to get through them, to help
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.880]   me to press forward.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:40.160]   I think of myself kind of like Tom Brady in the sense that there's a big difference between
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.080]   a rookie for whom everything has always gone well versus a seasoned professional who has
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.280]   had to pull it out from deep, from the deep end, right?
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.040]   When you're way, way down in a game and yet you still stay focused and calm and you deliver
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.160]   under pressure.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.480]   I am amazed at athletes who are skilled at that.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.680]   Having never been a competitive athlete in that sense, I would be all nerves.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.840]   You're down by 20 points at halftime and you're up against the team with the best defense
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.120]   in the world and yet the professionals so many times just come out and they keep pressing
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.120]   forward.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.400]   They keep pressing forward, play by play, moment by moment, and they put points on the
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.200]   board and often they come out with a win.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.080]   And so one of the things that I have learned in my life is to be more confident in myself.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.640]   And the fact is that I have never not had periods of difficulty.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.600]   I've never not felt under the weather.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.000]   I've never not had personal difficulty.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.760]   But what I have done is I have been able to continue pressing forward.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.920]   And so I begin with trying to get my mindset right.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.200]   I recognize I've been here before.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.280]   I'll probably be here again.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.440]   So let me just press forward right now.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.760]   And then the next thing is this too shall pass.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.280]   One of my personal mottos is this too shall pass.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.440]   No matter what it is, no matter how difficult it is, no matter how bad it is, this too shall
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.560]   pass.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.760]   And I comfort myself with those.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.500]   When I'm experiencing the heights of euphoria, I try to remind myself this too shall pass.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.980]   So enjoy it, but this too shall pass.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.320]   Don't get hooked on it.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.120]   And then when I'm in the pits of despair, then I just remind myself this too shall pass.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.960]   And I know it's going to pass, especially because it's passed before.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.440]   If it's your first time, I promise you, this too shall pass.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.960]   I try to pay a lot of attention to my mindset and to some basic core principles that I firmly
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.400]   believe are true.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:50.220]   And those principles and those mindsets help, especially during the difficult times.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.700]   They help during normal times, but they help a lot more during difficult times because
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.200]   they give you something that you can think about.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:07.720]   And so I have a set of them, many of them, that are very comforting to me when I face
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.280]   difficult times.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:17.640]   From the big macro ideas based on my philosophical worldview to just the micro day-to-day experience.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   You know, a simple example.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.520]   I'll give you a few examples of things that help me.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.760]   Whenever I'm going through something tough, I always just recognize that I'm probably
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.000]   going to laugh about this later and I'm going to tell stories about this down the road.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.320]   I've been over the years in so many uncomfortable situations, right?
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.040]   Traveling and everything is falling apart.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.400]   It's been another issue.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.560]   We had some house issues with no water and some other frustrating things, none of which
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.320]   are in isolation, all that big a deal.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.720]   But when compounded over everything else, it's just frustrating to deal with that.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.520]   And one of the things that I remind myself is I'm going to laugh about this later and
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.960]   this awful, difficult, terrible, hard experience is going to give me a fun story down the road.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.720]   So if I'm going to tell a fun story about this down the road, then why don't I go ahead
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.560]   and embrace it right now and say, "This sucks, but that's all right.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.600]   I'm going to tell a story about this down the road, so let me embrace the suck and press
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.280]   on through it."
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.360]   Maybe you're on a camping trip and your tent is pouring in ice cold rain and you're completely
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.840]   soaked, you're completely miserable, and there's nothing you can do about it except huddle
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.760]   up and just try to make it through the night.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.240]   Well, that's a story that you're going to be telling for the next few decades.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.980]   When I was younger, I heard my parents took my older siblings camping in some disastrous
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.880]   camping trip.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.560]   And I heard about it my entire lifetime, about this one time at such and such a campground
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.880]   when it was just awful.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.280]   It was a terrible experience and yet it gave a good fodder for a story.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.200]   So something simple and silly like that, to me, helps to brighten my mood a little bit
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.120]   and say, "This really sucks and yet I'm going to laugh about this down the road.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.440]   This is going to be the story that I tell about lying on the cold ground and just completely
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.120]   freezing and being totally miserable and hungry, blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.680]   And that was when I hit my low and we're going to laugh about it down the road."
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.000]   And little silly things like that help me.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.920]   I think on a more macro scale, when you look at life and you have a little bit of experience,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.480]   you recognize that the times that you learn the most in your life are the trial times,
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.120]   the difficult times.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.640]   And so with a little bit of age, you start to recognize that trials are actually extraordinarily
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.240]   valuable and I'm going to appreciate this trial when it's over.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.040]   I'm going to appreciate this difficult thing when it's over.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.440]   Sometimes it helps you to build empathy.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.160]   I know that for me, my empathy over the years has grown as I have gone through difficult
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   periods.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.240]   I remember the first time that my back got messed up.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.680]   I was always pretty healthy, always had a strong back.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.600]   One time, I was in my mid-20s and I wasn't doing anything strenuous, but all of a sudden
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.960]   I did something to tweak my back.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.640]   And for the first time in my life, I experienced severe back pain and was sitting down doing
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.560]   as little as possible for a couple of days until it recovered.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.680]   And it was terrible.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.500]   It was really tough.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.360]   But since that day, I have always had more empathy for people with back pain and I've
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.080]   come to appreciate it.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:22.120]   Even right now as I'm struggling to work in the face of dumb allergies and not feeling
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.760]   well, I appreciate the good health that I have most of the time.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.900]   Whenever I'm sick, I recognize how much of my own personal ability and my own personal
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:36.680]   success is due to simply having won the genetic lottery of just having good health.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.700]   And it builds my empathy and appreciation for the difficulties that so many other people
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.180]   face not having those things.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:49.240]   And so it's fairly simple, but it's effective to recognize that when this trial is over,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.640]   I'm going to really appreciate it.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.520]   Those are just small practical things.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.600]   But even if you go to its most fundamental foundation, for example, in my personal worldview,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.720]   I personally believe that the universe, to use the parlance of the day, the universe
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.240]   is conspiring for my good.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.000]   I don't like to use the word universe.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.880]   I use God, but I believe that God is conspiring for my good and he has promised to work all
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   things together in my life for good because I love him and I'm called according to his
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.200]   purpose.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.160]   So one of the very useful things that I find so helpful in the Christian faith is simply
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:39.800]   the idea that you have an all-powerful, all-knowing God of the universe who controls all things
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.600]   and that God knows me.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.680]   He knows my name and he is conspiring for my good.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:54.440]   He is sovereignly arranging all of the circumstances in my life for my own good.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:01.240]   And with his perfect middle knowledge, he has chosen the circumstances into which I
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.000]   am placed for my good.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.520]   And so, whatever those circumstances look like, if on the outside they look like blessings
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:18.800]   and abundance or if they look like scarcity and deprivation, pain or joy, I can be confident
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.120]   that these are the circumstances that God has chosen for me and thus I can embrace them
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.920]   with a happy heart filled with joy.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.080]   To me, that is one of the most powerful ideas in the history of the universe.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.080]   If you genuinely believe that based upon good arguments, evidence, being persuaded of the
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.880]   truth of that statement, it gives you a foundation that you can press forward and face anything
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.240]   with.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.840]   It's powerful.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.240]   It's powerful.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:57.080]   I find that just a place to rest and no matter how tragic or no matter how uncredible the
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:04.840]   circumstances are, I can simply rest and I can keep pressing forward seeking to honor
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.800]   God in my daily activities and in the way that I handle the circumstances that come
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.720]   at me.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.840]   There are more useful little things that I tell myself.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:21.440]   For example, most of my personal issues are usually short-lived, usually a few weeks maximum.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.960]   I'll go through a few difficult weeks at a time, then I'll kind of be back on the upswing.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:32.880]   And I often just remind myself, "Listen, Joshua, you don't have to get every day right.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.080]   You really don't.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.920]   You don't have to get every day right.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.960]   You just need to get some or most days right, depending on what we're talking about with
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.360]   right.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.800]   Everyone has a bad day.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.160]   Everyone messes up.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.720]   Everyone has times when they feel dark.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.400]   They don't feel so effective.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.520]   You don't have to get every day right.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.560]   But if you can get most days right, you can have tremendous results.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.240]   Every workout doesn't have to be the greatest workout.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.800]   But if you can show up to the gym and most of your workouts are pretty decent, you can
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.040]   get tremendous results.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.620]   Every investment doesn't have to be a complete winner.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.100]   But if you can get most of your investments mostly right, things are going to work out
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.940]   pretty well for you.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.340]   You don't have to get every day right.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.520]   You just have to get most days right, and I can do that.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:28.680]   Even if I get 20% or 30% or 40% of my days are just simply no good for whatever reason,
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.680]   that's okay.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:38.840]   I can still experience tremendous success with the other 50% or 70% or 90%.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.620]   Some of the world's greatest sports athletes, the world's greatest baseball players strike
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.880]   out all the time.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.240]   The world's greatest businessmen go bankrupt regularly.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.820]   And so reminding myself of those things and kind of taking the pressure off I've always
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.920]   found to be helpful.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.360]   I do my best whenever possible to try to get my body right.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:12.560]   I think that our body makes a big difference in obviously the way that we experience life.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.280]   And my list is fairly simple.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.260]   If everything is going poorly and I can only do one thing, I do my best to get my sleep
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.260]   on track.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.640]   Make sure I go to bed on time, do my best to get a good night's sleep, wake up on time
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.000]   and get a good night's sleep.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.480]   Because being well rested makes a tremendous difference in your ability to fight, to fight
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   through.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.240]   And so I work really hard to just get my sleep on time.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.600]   And the big decision there is simply, for me anyway, some people struggle with insomnia,
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.120]   I don't generally.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.960]   But the big difference there is just simply going to bed.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.240]   Turning off the screens, turning off the input and going to bed on time.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.440]   That's the secret.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.520]   And if you just simply exercise the willpower to force yourself to go and lie down in bed,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.360]   I think for most of us that works.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   The second thing I pay attention to is sunshine.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.920]   If I don't feel well, I do my best to get some sunshine and try to get some vitamin
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.360]   D generation going, try to get a little sun on my face.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.760]   Does wonders for your mood when you can face sunshine.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.680]   So if you are facing something seasonal and it's gray and it's cloudy and whatnot, try
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.840]   to get some sunshine.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.520]   That could mean an artificial lamp, it could mean a plane ticket to Mexico, but try to
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.080]   get some sunshine.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.800]   The third thing that I think really makes a difference is movement.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.320]   Trying to get some physical movement.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.600]   And a lot of times when I'm not feeling well, nothing's working, I'm sitting just staring
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.320]   blankly at my computer, unable to produce anything useful, then going and getting some
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.480]   physical movement changes things for me.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.640]   For some people that's a good hard workout, right?
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   Go and take a spinning class.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.600]   It's hard to come out of a good hard spinning class and really feel frustrated at anything,
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   right?
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.880]   It's hard to go and do a hard CrossFit workout and come out in a bad mood.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.360]   It's really hard.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.200]   But at its very least, kind of low level, I just try to go for a walk.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.640]   At the very least, what can I do?
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.240]   I can go for a walk.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:13.400]   And so many times just sitting there metaphorically banging my head on the desk and walk outside,
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.320]   go for a 20 minute walk in the sunshine, come back and everything is better.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:25.040]   And so if you're struggling for some reason, try to get movement if at all possible.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.640]   And then the final piece I think is just simply to focus on your food and eat something that's
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.680]   going to make you feel good.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.640]   Don't eat too much, eat lightly and eat something that you know is going to make you feel good.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:43.840]   You know that if you eat a big heavy high calorie meal and drink four beers, you're
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.240]   going to feel awful and everything's going to get worse.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.360]   So try to eat something that's going to make you feel good.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:57.600]   That might mean some gastronomical delight, might mean a favorite food, but I think this
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:03.080]   means choosing something that's going to help you to feel better physically.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.840]   And so if you're not feeling well, if you're struggling, if you're in a black place mentally,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.040]   just repair yourself to those things.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.880]   Sleep, sunshine, movement, food and water.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.160]   I guess I should add as well, stay hydrated, drink water.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.360]   One of the things that can often happen, people feeling tired a lot of times because they're
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   dehydrated.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.960]   Sometimes when you don't feel well, it's because you're dehydrated and so hydrate yourself
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   well.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.480]   Those are the things I do to get my body right.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.600]   Get your mind right when possible.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.680]   Things I find helpful when I'm in a black place and nothing's working.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.200]   I think about my goals, I review my goals, I had to keep my goals on an app, my notes
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   app.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.320]   So I just pull it open and I take a look and I read through and I think about, I form some
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.480]   mental pictures of things that are exciting to me.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.200]   I also personally record my goals, I record audio of them.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:57.360]   I do the silly thing where I record myself speaking over a dramatic movie soundtrack
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.000]   and so I can put that on and listen to it for a few minutes.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.760]   And so think about something that I'm excited about, sometimes will help me to focus me
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.760]   and kind of bring me out of it.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.520]   To get my mind right, I try very hard to talk to people.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.520]   I don't isolate.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.700]   I think that one of the worst things that a lot of people can do is to isolate.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.540]   There are times when isolation helps.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:24.780]   For example, you may be an introvert who gains energy by being alone and you would know that
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.140]   about yourself.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:31.180]   But don't cut yourself off from those that you care about and those who care about you.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.760]   And so I just try not to isolate.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.800]   I often, I almost never talk to anybody about my problems unless that person has a vested
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   interest.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.720]   Talk to a coach, to an advisor, to a consultant, to a therapist, somebody who can actually
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.760]   help you with something.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.960]   So I don't talk about my problems with people who can't actually help me with them.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.040]   But by not cutting myself off from people, it often helps me to feel better.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.160]   And so a lot of times I'll just walk away from the thing that are causing me trouble
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   and go do something.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.800]   I have children, so hey, this isn't working.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   This day is shot.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.160]   Nothing is working here.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.000]   Everything is falling apart.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.880]   I'm sitting here again banging my head against the desk and it's not working.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.340]   So let's go do something fun.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.340]   Let's go for a hike.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.280]   Let's go out for ice cream.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.000]   Let's go to the park and just do something with those that I care about.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.560]   And the idea here is, as you'll see in a moment when I talk about kind of fallback plans,
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:33.920]   the idea is have something that you can fall back on when plan A isn't working.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   Actually, let me do it now.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.080]   I'll switch up my order.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.840]   If you're doing an activity and that activity isn't working for you, having a fallback plan
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   that's still moving you forward in some way will be very helpful for you.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.120]   Let's use a simple example.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.920]   I go out and I try to use walking as my main form of cardio exercise, but I don't enjoy
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.900]   walking in the rain.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:05.400]   And so if I want to go for a walk and I find that it's raining when I want to go for a
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:11.920]   walk, then I find myself frustrated because I can't get my walk in without going and walking
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.640]   in the rain, which isn't very fun.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:20.000]   And many times in my life, I have just simply not exercised because it was raining.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.880]   Well, that's dumb.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.480]   That's really dumb.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.320]   A better plan is to have a fallback, to say, "All right, if it's raining and I don't want
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.840]   to go and walk in the rain today, then what could I do instead of that?"
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.380]   So if I want to walk, could I drive to the mall and walk around the mall where it's air
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.960]   conditioned and there's no rain coming in?
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   Could I go to Home Depot and walk around Home Depot and the aisles of Home Depot and get
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   my steps in that way?
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.320]   Should I have a treadmill at my house that I can walk on the treadmill at my house or
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.700]   go to a gym and walk on a treadmill?
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.920]   Should I have some other piece of equipment, an indoor bicycle machine, a rowing machine,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.040]   whatever it is that I want?
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.720]   Or should I go and just pay for a one-off class at the gym or a one-day pass at the
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.500]   gym to go and walk?
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.760]   Having some kind of backup plan so that the choice is not either go walk in the rain,
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.080]   which I don't want to do or do nothing, but rather, "Hey, it's raining.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.560]   I'll quickly go to this backup plan," improves things.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.080]   And so for me, I have developed over the years a few of those things that help me.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.320]   So for example, if I'm struggling and I'm struggling to create something, I'm struggling
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.680]   with some business task and it's just not working and I'm frustrated and my brain isn't
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.920]   working and everything feels black and I just want to quit, then I try to have a backup
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.360]   activity that's going to still keep me going.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.320]   So one of my primary ones is I'll go and read something.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.240]   I'll say, "This isn't working," and ask myself, "Should I just power through?"
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.920]   Because there are times you just power through.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.920]   But this isn't working.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.900]   I'm not going to just sit here and try to force myself to do this.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.240]   So let me go and sit down and read.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.640]   And so I'll go read.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   But I'll try to read something that's going to help me.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.080]   So I'll read a self-improvement book in a foreign language.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:16.360]   Then I feel like I'm getting something, I'm learning something, and I'm helping myself
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   study a foreign language.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.400]   I'll read a business book, give me ideas that I can apply, and also do it in a foreign language.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   Or if that doesn't work, then I'll go ahead and say, "I don't want to study business.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   I'm done with business.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   I don't feel like doing anything."
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   Well, I'll read a novel.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.840]   But then, again, I'll try to read a novel in a foreign language, which is just as enjoyable,
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.320]   but now I'm making progress on one of my language goals instead of just reading and wasting
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.240]   time.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.480]   Maybe for you, maybe you're a TV watcher, and your choice would be, "Well, I'm just
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.000]   going to read instead of watching TV because it can help me expand my vocabulary.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   It's going to be simpler.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.600]   It's going to be easier for me to walk away in an hour instead of being sucked into four
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.920]   seasons of this particular drama."
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.140]   Or if you want to watch TV, great.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.160]   But maybe I'll watch something useful.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.800]   Try to watch a show that's going to make you smarter, inspire you.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.920]   Might choose Shark Tank instead of whatever the latest drama is.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.200]   Or if you're going to watch a drama, watch it in a foreign language.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.440]   Or if you're going to go to YouTube, browse something educational instead of something
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.280]   that's just pure fluff, pure twaddle.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.440]   And so for me, I can usually find something that has some redeeming value.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:30.400]   And while I'm walking away from this frustration, I'm walking away from this thing that's just
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.840]   not working right now.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.640]   I'm not just doing nothing.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.080]   I'm getting something useful.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   And then you start to stack.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.720]   I try to stack these things up.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.120]   All right, this isn't working.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.360]   I'm frustrated.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.840]   So I'm going to grab an audio book, a novel in Spanish, and I'm going to go for a walk.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   I'm going to get sunshine.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.880]   I'm going to get movement.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   I'm going to get fresh air.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.160]   I'm going to hydrate myself while I go out.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.120]   I'm going to listen to this nice novel in a foreign language that I'm studying.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.080]   And now when I come back an hour later, things have brightened up a little bit and I can
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.240]   work at it again.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.080]   Those are some just things that are often useful for me.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.880]   And then when I get to the end of the day and I look at what I have done and what I
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.980]   haven't done, even if I spent the day reading, well, if I spent the day reading in a foreign
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.720]   language about something that was helpful, basically it's like, well, it's like being
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.720]   in college, right?
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.880]   I was studying something that was going to help my career and I was building my foreign
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.260]   language ability.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.280]   Those things are helpful.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.420]   When I'm in a difficult spot, I try to make sure that there's nothing going wrong except
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.580]   a little bit of time.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.600]   So this is, depends on where you are, right?
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.360]   And what the particular crisis that you're facing is.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.280]   A lot of times the crises that I undergo are just things that are frustrating to me.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.520]   I can't get work done.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   All right.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.720]   I'm in a bad mental state and trying to figure out how to get out of it.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.620]   So if I can control the big things, then a little bit of time can just pass.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.320]   So I don't want to spend a lot of money.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.200]   I don't want to have anything out of control.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.760]   A few days isn't going to hurt me.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.560]   I know I'll feel better next week.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.500]   I'll lose a week on my timelines, but that's okay.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.640]   As long as I control the money, as long as I control my relationships, as long as I don't
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:25.360]   start speaking in an ugly way towards my wife or towards my children, I can have a bad workday.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.040]   I can have a bad evening and it's okay as long as I don't do something that I'm going
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   to regret.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   I'm not going to go out and go gambling.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.480]   I'm not going to go out and go drinking.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.240]   I'm not going to go and yell at somebody.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.520]   I'm just going to control things and recognize that time will fix this problem because time
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.880]   fixes many problems.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.520]   So control the things that you can control.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.520]   Again, for me, that's money.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.800]   Control the money.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.240]   It's my words.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.240]   Control my words.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.840]   Don't say something I'm going to regret.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.200]   Don't commit to something that I'm going to regret.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:04.680]   Just let a few days go and then come back and start again.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:12.320]   I do find that as I get older, it becomes easier because I'm less focused on the disaster
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.640]   that is today.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   If I were 22 years old working a job, you expect I can't have any bad days.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.800]   You get a little older, you get a little money under your belt, your investments start making
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.840]   money for you, your business starts to work and you can press forward.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.920]   One of the things that has often motivated me to try to do something, to build a business
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:38.600]   that has something that works without my presence has been that it gives you options.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.280]   If you want to wake up richer tomorrow, whether you're going to have a good day or a bad
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.200]   day, then you got to build something that's going to just work.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.080]   You got to build a book that's going to pay you royalties because someone buys it whether
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.400]   or not you're feeling good that day.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.680]   You got to build a business where you have customers and staff who are going to come
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:01.200]   in and go to work whether or not you go to work in that particular day.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:10.520]   More and more, the days that go by, you face a difficult day and it's not as bad as it
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.680]   was when you didn't have that business built.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.960]   When you didn't have those employees working on things for you.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.040]   And so this has often been one of my motivations for building a business rather than simply
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.720]   being dependent on my day-to-day work.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.040]   Two more comments that I hope will be helpful.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:39.560]   In order to deal with setbacks, I find it usually easiest to just change the timeline.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.440]   I don't know who to give credit to, but somebody famous said, "There are no unreasonable goals,
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.400]   only unreasonable timelines or unreasonable deadlines."
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   I think that's pretty true.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:57.200]   There aren't really any unreasonable goals, only unreasonable timelines or deadlines.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.340]   And since you're the one who makes up the deadline in the first place, makes up the
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.160]   timeline in the first place, you can just simply change it.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.040]   Now obviously you should be careful about renegotiating your deals.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.840]   Sometimes you buckle in, you pull an all-nighter and you get the work done on time because
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.160]   that's what you said you were going to do.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.640]   No question.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.040]   Sometimes you can just change it.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.440]   You can just adjust it and say, "This isn't working for me.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.240]   I'm not going to reach this, so let me just change it and add more time."
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.520]   And if the things that you're working on are things that are worthwhile, they're probably
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:32.280]   going to be worthwhile just as worthwhile a week late or a year late as they are a week
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.860]   early or a year early.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:42.120]   If you're working to reach financial independence at 45 years old, but you get delayed by a
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:47.880]   series of failures in your life and you reach it at 47, you can either focus on the fact
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:54.320]   that you're a loser who missed your goal date by two years or on the fact that, "Hey, even
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.800]   though I faced all these problems and complications, I'm financially independent at 47.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   That's awesome.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.200]   That's a lot earlier than a lot of people are financially independent."
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.360]   And almost anything worthwhile, almost anything that we care about functions the same way
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.520]   in life.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   Let's say you want to learn Spanish and you think it's going to take you 600 hours to
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.520]   learn Spanish.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.040]   And you sit down and you say a goal and you say, "I'm going to learn Spanish this year
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.300]   because I'm going to put in 600 hours over the course of 300 days.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.660]   This year I'm going to do it."
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.660]   And then something happens.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.480]   Instead of doing two hours a day, you wind up doing 1.1 hours per day.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.320]   Well, you're going to be off your timeline by ... Your timeline is basically going to
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.760]   double.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.360]   But in the grand scheme of things, if you just keep pressing forward, you're still going
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   to learn Spanish.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.360]   You really are.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.800]   It's just a matter of keep pressing forward little by little, day by day.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.360]   You're still going to learn Spanish.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.640]   And if two years from now you can speak Spanish fluently, you'll be in good shape.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.280]   Doesn't matter whether you were a year late.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280]   That's all right.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.320]   It's just part of the journey.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.740]   Enjoy the process.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.800]   Maybe your goal is to say, "I'm going to lose a pound a day."
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.760]   And then instead of doing that, you lose a quarter of a pound a day.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   That's okay.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.920]   If you lose a quarter of a pound a day for long enough, you'll reach your goals.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.800]   Just change the time and recognize that the forward progress is what's important, not
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.360]   this specific timeline.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.720]   You've made up most of these timelines, most of these goals.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:27.040]   And when they're helpful to you because they're inspiring, use them.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.840]   But when they're not helpful to you because they cause you to feel overwhelmed and stressed,
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.560]   toss those suckers.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.240]   You don't need them.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:44.520]   Finally, when you go through difficult periods, dark periods of your life, ask yourself, "Why
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.160]   did that happen?
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:52.240]   What caused me to face that difficult period?"
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.240]   And you can analyze this at almost any level.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.960]   Right now, I'm sniffing and snorting today because I have some kind of weird allergies
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.960]   to where I am right now.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.520]   I don't know why I have them.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   I don't know what they are.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.840]   I haven't been able to figure out what they are.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.640]   But they have really messed up my work week because when I'm sniffing and snorting and
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:13.600]   I can't speak, I can't work effectively in creating audible content.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:19.840]   When I'm sneezing 20 times in a row, I can't think very clearly to create something useful.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   And then I start to get behind.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:25.280]   I start to not produce shows and it just starts to mess everything up.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.080]   So what's my analysis of the problem?
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.320]   Well, this stinks.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:39.640]   As I pause the show to sneeze eight times and then three more times, you just say, "All
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.840]   right, this stinks."
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.040]   And one more sneeze.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.400]   This stinks.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.920]   I don't like this.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.320]   I don't like not being able to work.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.720]   And what's a solution for me?
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.200]   In my case, I'm leaving.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.760]   So maybe I need to go spend more time in the desert and not be in the jungle because there's
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.320]   some kind of weird pollen or something that's causing me to sneeze.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.600]   Maybe I need to go and get some kind of allergy medication.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.880]   Maybe I need to try to go through a series of blood tests and figure out what it is that
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.280]   is causing me a problem.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.080]   Maybe I need to try an elimination diet.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:20.040]   You just got to start working your way through the problems and do your best to systematically
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.240]   work on solutions.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.240]   Try a solution.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   See if it works.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   Does it make things better?
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.240]   No, it didn't.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.320]   All right, we'll toss that one.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.400]   Try the next one.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   Try the next one.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.580]   Try the next one and keep on going and don't stop until you find a solution that improves
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.020]   things for you.
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.960]   And just keep on going, systematically working your way through.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.400]   Back to one of these useful mental principles, the principle of just pressing forward, of
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:46.560]   trying new things, of not ever allowing yourself to say, "Oh, I'm just a victim of the circumstances.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:51.320]   No, I got to get on top of these circumstances and control the things that I can control
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:58.000]   so that I can eliminate this being sick thing," or whatever the issue is that you're facing.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.720]   Maybe you face a thing in your business, right?
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.280]   We have this problem, an unhappy customer, or this thing happened.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.440]   Okay, well, how can I change the systems in the business?
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.660]   Who can I hire?
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.400]   Who can help me achieve this certain thing?
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.180]   How can I move this forward?
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:20.040]   How can I stop doing this thing that I don't want to do?
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.640]   Just keep pressing forward and keep fixing things.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.980]   Analyze things.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:30.560]   Try to come up with creative solutions and then pick a solution if you like it.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:38.760]   For me, again, one of my – I do this on my phone, but I have a note.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.600]   It's called Journaling My Problems.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   I pick a problem.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:50.640]   I write the problem and I say, "Here is the problem that I'm facing," and then I just
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.240]   start brainstorming solutions.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.600]   Write a list of one to ten, make myself write ten solutions to it.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.320]   Then I close the note, move on with my life, come back the next day, open it, look at it,
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.160]   see, and do I like any of those solutions?
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.680]   Do I think any of them might actually work?
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.560]   Do I want to implement any of them?
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.720]   Are any of them actually good or are they all junk?
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.000]   If they're all junk, I write the problem a different way.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.120]   One to ten, brainstorm ten new solutions and just keep pressing on.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.540]   You do that over time and you start to have fewer and fewer issues.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.520]   You start to do better and better.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.800]   You clean up a mess here.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.040]   You clean up a mess there.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.640]   Pretty soon, you cleaned up enough messes that the times of bleakness and blackness
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:34.560]   and difficulty, etc., are fewer and they're shorter and they're less often and that helps.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.560]   Then you can just press forward.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:43.440]   Those are some of the things that I do, that I am doing and I hope they're useful to you.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.360]   I always feel a little silly doing these kinds of shows because to me, most of this stuff
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.280]   seems self-evident, but I've done this long enough to know that it's probably not self-evident
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.280]   to anybody.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:58.600]   I hope that if you're one who faces some of the things that I face and emotional swings,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:03.280]   etc., that some of these things can be useful to you.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.120]   Thank you for listening to the show and I'll be back with you with more higher quality
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.840]   stuff as soon as I can.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.360]   Thank you so much.
