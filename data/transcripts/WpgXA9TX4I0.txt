[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.920]   that portion of scripture which we read at the beginning in the epistle to the Colossians
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.120]   in the first chapter.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680]   Let me read again from verse 3 to verse 7.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.200]   We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.640]   since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which he hath to all the saints,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.720]   for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.440]   truth of the gospel, which is come unto you as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.640]   fruit as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.800]   in truth, as ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellow-servant, who is for you a
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.920]   faithful minister of Christ.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.800]   Now there is one thing about this letter to the Colossians that makes it of particular
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.840]   interest, and that is that the apostle Paul here is writing to people who had not come
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.520]   into the Christian faith as the result of his own ministry, and many of whom, as he
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.680]   indicates in the second chapter, had not even seen him, and he hadn't seen them.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.680]   That I say is an interesting point, because I believe it was one of the things that led
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.560]   the apostle to write to these people in the way and manner in which he did.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.200]   They had clearly come into the Christian faith and had become members of the Christian church
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.680]   as the result of the preaching of this man Epaphras.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.120]   Now Epaphras was not an apostle.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.640]   He was a preacher, he was one who had been commissioned to preach the gospel, but he
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.080]   was not an apostle.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.320]   And I suppose that that is therefore partly the reason why the great apostle himself,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.080]   when he comes to write to these people, to confirm them and to establish them in the
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.960]   faith, reminds them of some of the first essentials and first principles of this, our Christian
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960]   faith.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.000]   Now he did that for a number of reasons.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.440]   He did it for the reason I've given, but there was another and a very pressing reason,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.480]   and that was that there were certain false teachers who were confusing these early Christians,
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.040]   people going around arrogating great authority and power to themselves, saying, "This is
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   the true gospel.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   Listen to this.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.640]   Don't listen to these others.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.080]   This is the real message," and so on.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.860]   And it was a very involved and confusing message, but there were certain people who were ready
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.440]   to listen to it.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.240]   And the apostle is anxious to rid them of this false teaching and to establish them
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.080]   in the faith, that they may enjoy it in all its fullness and all the great blessings which
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.600]   it has to give.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.480]   Well now, there are other reasons then why he, I think, here, goes out of his way to
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.940]   deal with the gospel in general and then in its particular propositions.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.800]   And I'm calling your attention to this tonight, and I hope to continue doing so on future
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.040]   Sunday evenings, God willing, because it seems to me that this is more necessary today than
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.480]   perhaps it has ever been.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.200]   We are confronted by the simple fact that in this country alone, only ten percent of
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.440]   the people claim to be Christian, the great majority are outside.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.040]   And that should be a matter of grave concern to everybody.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.800]   Why is that?
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.240]   Why are the masses of the people outside the Christian church?
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.800]   Why is this Christian message rejected as it is, and not only rejected, but ignored,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.200]   dismissed, without any real consideration at all?
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.760]   Well now, I believe we must address ourselves to this question.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.120]   There's great confusion as to what Christianity really is.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.000]   The confusion is to be seen, as I say, in the world outside.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.600]   People have extraordinary ideas as to what Christianity is.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.280]   That's why so many of them don't come to listen to it even, and are not interested
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   in it.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.080]   They think they know what it is.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.540]   But if you talk to them, you'll find that their whole idea and notion concerning it
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.320]   is something which is completely devast from the truth.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   But there it is.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.940]   There is this terrible confusion outside the church with respect to the real character
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.440]   of the Christian faith and the Christian message.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.680]   But – and I'm sorry to have to say this, and yet I say it because I want to help someone
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.000]   who may have come into this service who is not a Christian and who doesn't belong to
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.920]   any Christian church – there is confusion, alas, inside the church as well as outside
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920]   the church.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.920]   And I'm not sure that it isn't this confusion inside the church as to what Christianity
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.840]   is that is mainly responsible for the confusion that is outside.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.760]   The man on the street looks at us and says, "When you Christians can begin to agree
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.040]   amongst yourselves as to what Christianity is, I'll be prepared to listen to you."
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.920]   But he says, "There you are, you all call yourselves Christians and yet you say things
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.360]   that are blank contradictions of what others say.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.360]   What is it?
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.360]   What is your faith?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.360]   What is your message?"
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.880]   Now, we've got to face the facts.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.880]   I'm not in this pulpit to defend the Christian church.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.880]   That's not my calling.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.360]   I'm here to preach the gospel that men and women may be saved by it.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.320]   It's not a part of my function and my calling to defend an institution or anything else.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.440]   I am called, as I understand it, to speak in the name of God and the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.040]   by the power of the Holy Spirit to men and women in need and in trouble.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.840]   I am not here to defend any institution as such, I say, not even Christendom and the
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.040]   Christian church in general.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.600]   But I am here to try to make plain and clear the message of this great and this glorious
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   gospel.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.960]   Well, now then, here, as I'm pointing out in this introduction to this epistle particularly,
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.880]   the great apostle puts before us the very fundamentals and vitals of this Christian
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.920]   message, this Christian faith.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.960]   Let's look at it like this for a moment.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.840]   Now let's forget all about Christendom.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.960]   Let's forget for the moment all that we've habitually thought about the Christian church.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.840]   Let's forget all about massive cathedrals or small little chapels.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.800]   Let's forget all about great councils that are being held in various parts of the world
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.520]   and are going to be held.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.960]   Let's forget all about that.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.720]   Let's try as far as we can to think this evening and to face this message as if we
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.360]   knew nothing about all those things at all.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.800]   And let's go back to the beginning, because we know this very well, don't we, about
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.420]   any institution, that it's always in danger of becoming something very different from
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.240]   what it once was.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.960]   That's true of everything human, isn't it?
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.840]   We tend to change things.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.600]   And sometimes the change is so gradual and so subtle that people don't realize that
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.560]   there's been a change.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.480]   But that happens to every institution.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.800]   And as I hope to say in a moment, that is something I suggest to you which has happened
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.000]   to the Christian church.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.720]   That's what I mean by saying that I'm not here to defend Christendom.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.120]   I'm here to preach this.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.320]   So let's forget all that we know and all that we have ever seen.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.760]   And let's ask this simple question.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760]   What is this Christianity?
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.920]   Well, there's no better way of discovering that than to ask this question.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.400]   How did it begin?
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.360]   Go back to the origin of a thing.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.120]   That's the thing to do always.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.320]   What was it at the beginning?
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.920]   Surely that is a wise thing to do.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.280]   Well, what we find is this, you see.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.200]   Here is the Apostle Paul writing to a little group of people at a place called Colossae.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.280]   He addresses them as the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colossae.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.600]   Now get rid, I say, immediately of any notion of even a building such as this, or of a great
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.960]   cathedral or an abbey or anything like that.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.000]   Get rid of all that.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.360]   These people were meeting in a house.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.240]   A group of people who came together regularly and held their meetings, and there they'd
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.560]   spend their time in praying together, in studying the Old Testament scriptures as best they
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.400]   could, and in talking to one another about the Christian life and their experience of
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.840]   it, endeavouring to help and to strengthen one another that they might go forward into
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.240]   this life, more and more into which they'd been introduced.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.960]   There they are, just a group of people who met constantly together in a house, and they're
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.960]   addressed as saints and faithful brethren which are in Christ at Colossae.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.520]   Now here's the question.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.720]   How would they ever come into being?
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.600]   What was it that brought them together?
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.080]   How do you explain this church as it's called at Colossae?
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.320]   Now here's the primitive pattern, you see.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.560]   You hadn't got a great array of functionaries and dignitaries and great pomp and ceremony,
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:19.720]   nothing like that at all, just a house with a small company of people meeting together.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.240]   One perhaps who had a greater understanding of these things than the other was a kind
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.560]   of leader, but they all took part and they all spoke and they all gave their experiences
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.640]   and they all joined in praying together.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.160]   Now that's the picture.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.520]   That was what is meant by the church at Colossae.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.920]   How did it come into being?
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.680]   How did similar churches come into being right through Asia Minor, indeed right through the
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.760]   various parts and countries of the then civilized world?
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.280]   The apostle puts it like this.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.080]   He says, "You heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which is come unto
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.000]   you as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   day you heard it."
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.940]   And you notice that later on he went on to say that this was preached to every creature
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.940]   that is under him.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.040]   That's a bit of a hyperbole.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.440]   What he means is this.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:17.880]   All the Roman Empire, all the countries of the Roman Empire, were now countries in which
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.520]   these little groups had come into being, and they were called Christian churches.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.360]   Now this is a remarkable thing.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.660]   This is a great fact of history.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.800]   This is a phenomenon.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.760]   And I am suggesting to you tonight that this is a very good way of approaching this whole
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   question.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.680]   Do you know what Christianity is, my friend?
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.060]   Do you really understand the essence of this thing?
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.120]   I am concerned about this because, as I say, the more I talk to people about this and the
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.900]   more they talk to me, and thank God they do talk in my room here and sometimes in trains
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.140]   and other places, I am more and more convinced that people are outside the Christian church
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.700]   just because they don't know.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.700]   They haven't the faintest notion as to what it's all about.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.820]   They're thinking of some big institution.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.900]   They know nothing about this kind of thing, but this is, as I want to show you, real and
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.900]   true Christianity.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.340]   Very well, now then, how did these churches come into being?
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.020]   The answer is they came into being as the result of preaching by certain people, the
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.700]   apostles, and men like Epaphras and others.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:25.500]   These people went round and they spoke, they delivered a message.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.940]   What was that message?
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.100]   That's the thing.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.940]   What was this message that was preached which produced this phenomenon?
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.660]   Here in pagan countries, under the rule and dominion of the mighty Roman Empire, these
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.700]   little groups came into being, these little churches.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.600]   What produced them?
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.900]   It was this message.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:51.680]   Now then, what is it that brings us directly to this question as to what Christianity really
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.680]   is?
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.980]   Well, now then, I'm only going to deal with it in general this evening because we must
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.980]   start with these general principles.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.580]   I find so often when I talk to people about these things, they come down to some particular
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.580]   question.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:10.100]   Now, they can't hope to understand the particular unless they're right about the general.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.900]   You see, a man may come to me and say, "Now, I want to know about the Christian attitude
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.260]   towards war."
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.940]   I can't discuss that with him unless he's a Christian because if he doesn't know what
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.340]   Christianity is, how can he possibly know what the Christian attitude is?
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.900]   And so often as you get these discussions, that's the trouble.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.220]   The people are not really arguing and disagreeing about war.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.500]   The real difference is as to what Christianity is.
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.460]   And people divide and go wrong in their views about war and various other matters simply
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.100]   because they're not clear in their minds as to what the thing itself is, the Christianity
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.100]   itself.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:50.060]   Now, it's a part of this message to say this, that a man cannot think in a Christian way
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.180]   until he's become a Christian.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:58.340]   A man can't hope to understand the Christian attitude until he has the Christian spirit
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.700]   within him.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:07.180]   Now, I'm not saying this, the Apostle Paul says, "He that is spiritual judgeth all things,
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.700]   yet he himself is judged of no man."
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.420]   He means this.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.420]   The Christian, he says, is a man who in the light of this gospel which he's believed has
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.480]   got an understanding of everything.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.480]   But nobody understands him.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.380]   They say, "What's the matter with that man?
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.720]   He's not what he used to be.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.540]   He doesn't look at things in the same way."
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.540]   And they don't understand him.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.540]   For instance, let me give you a very simple illustration and example of what I'm trying
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.540]   to say.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:41.900]   Here's a man who formerly used to think that what really made life was food and drink.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.220]   You know the kind of person.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.600]   You probably saw some of them on the television earlier part of this week.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.560]   What is the real foundation of culture?
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.280]   What is the real basis of the good life in the highest sense?
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.600]   The answer given was, "Good food, good drink."
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.000]   Now then, there's a man, you see, with a point of view.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Well now, take a man like that who comes under the influence and the power of this gospel.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.080]   And you go and talk to him.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.480]   And you'll find he'll no longer say that.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.480]   He doesn't say now that the basis of the good life is good food and good drink.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.520]   No, no, no, he says, "Isn't that, it's God, Christ."
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.520]   And the other people look at him and they say, "What's the matter with him?
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.520]   Has he gone mad?
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   Has he gone soft?
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.680]   Has he developed a religious complex?"
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.160]   They don't understand him now.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.400]   This man's got a new understanding.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.200]   "He that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.680]   They can't understand him.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.680]   Why?
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.200]   Well, something's happened to this man.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.660]   He's got an entirely new outlook upon all of life and all its attendant circumstances
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.760]   and problems.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.800]   And to everybody else he's become an enigma.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.720]   Well, he's become a Christian.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.480]   Now then, you see, before we come to particular questions, we've got to get the thing in general,
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.480]   the thing as a whole.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.600]   Very well, here's our question.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.680]   What is this Christian message?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.400]   And the answer is given us here very plainly.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.200]   I really am going to confine myself almost entirely to the fifth verse.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:17.160]   "Whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel."
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160]   Let me give you another translation.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:26.840]   "Whereof ye heard in the word of the true gospel, which is come unto you as it is in
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.080]   all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you since the day ye heard
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.960]   of it, and ye with the grace of God in truth, as ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellow-servant,
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.040]   who is for you a faithful minister of Christ."
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.160]   Very well, here's the first thing.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.000]   What is this Christian message?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.120]   What is Christianity?
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.760]   And the answer is, it is a gospel.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.120]   The word of the true gospel.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.520]   Now then, here's the starting point.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.640]   It's no use going any further unless we're agreed about this.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.880]   Here's the broadest definition you can ever have of the Christian message, the Christian
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   faith.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.280]   It is a gospel.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.880]   This is its great central characteristic, a gospel.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   What's a gospel?
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.020]   There's no difficulty about that, is there?
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:23.080]   We all know that the word "gospel" means "good news."
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.880]   That's what it means, good news.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.960]   Right, here's our starting point.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.760]   Whatever else this message is, it is good news.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.600]   Look, here says Paul, I'm writing to you, "You are saints and faithful brethren at Colossae.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.480]   You are meeting together in your church.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.480]   Why are you doing so?
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.960]   Well, you are doing so because you believed and you heard and accepted the word of the
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.280]   true gospel that was delivered to you as it's being delivered everywhere else, in your case
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   by Epaphras.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.760]   Gospel.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   The first thing, therefore, we say about this is that it is the announcement of some great
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.720]   and wonderful good news.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.640]   Now I'm going to ask a question before I go any further.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.680]   Let's be quite honest with one another.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:14.620]   As you've thought of Christianity, has it always been in terms of good news?
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.640]   Is that your habitual way of thinking of it?
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.040]   If it isn't, you're already wrong.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.480]   If you've thought of Christianity as just a very hard task that's put before us, a moral
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.320]   life that we've got to live, an ethical program to follow, something that demands great sacrifices
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:34.120]   from us and imposes a duty upon us, if that's your view of it, well, of course, there's
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.800]   no good news about it.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.560]   And you're already wrong.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   It's a gospel.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:44.280]   Now, I want to prove this, because this is to me the greatest tragedy of all, that people
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:49.360]   will persist in regarding this as some terrible task that's put upon people.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.280]   And so, you see, I've known people, indeed, I've been through this phase myself, years
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.800]   ago when I wished I never heard of Christianity.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.520]   This thing that stood between me and the pleasures I wanted to enjoy and the life I wanted to
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.840]   live, I wished I hadn't been brought up in that atmosphere, I wished I hadn't heard about
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.840]   it.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.800]   What a terrible view to take of good news, the most thrilling and the most wonderful
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.820]   good news that's ever come into this old world of ours.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.820]   That's what this is.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.420]   Now, let me prove my case to you.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.880]   Look at the way in which it's announced all along.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:22.900]   You go back to the very beginning of the gospel, in the gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.120]   And one of the first men that really spoke about it was the father of John the Baptist.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.480]   You see, there was one even before John the Baptist, and that was the father of John the
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   Baptist.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.720]   You remember this man, he was a priest, and he was doing duty in the temple on one occasion.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.160]   Suddenly he was given a vision, but he couldn't accept it, he couldn't believe it, his faith
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.040]   staggered, and he was struck dumb, and he remained dumb for many months, until his child
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.200]   was born, who became known as John the Baptist.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.660]   And then suddenly his tongue was loosed, his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.420]   loosed and he spake, and what did he do?
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.280]   And praised God.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.760]   Why did he praise God?
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.560]   Well, this is the reason.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.640]   Listen to Zacharias speaking.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.260]   And Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied, saying, "Blessed be the
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.320]   Lord God of Israel."
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.800]   This is how Christianity starts always.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.600]   You see, not a number of people deciding to draw up an ethical moral program, or a number
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.400]   of people deciding to protest against this or that.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.480]   No, no, Christianity doesn't start like that.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.160]   That's not Christianity.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.800]   That's the creed, that's the belief of men who are antagonists and opponents of Christianity,
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   most of them.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   This is Christianity.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.280]   "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, why, he hath visited and redeemed his people, and
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:45.960]   hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.640]   As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began, that
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.080]   we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us, to perform the
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:01.520]   mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant," and so on and so on.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.080]   That's Christianity.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.880]   But listen to another description of it, how it all began, you see.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.320]   This is good news.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:15.000]   Listen for instance to what happened to the Virgin Mary who gave birth to our Lord.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.440]   You remember the story, don't you, about how she was visited suddenly, unexpectedly, one
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.920]   afternoon by the archangel Gabriel.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.280]   And he began to speak to her.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.000]   And what did he say to her?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.760]   Well, you remember his language.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.040]   We all of us surely are familiar with this.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.000]   The angel suddenly appeared to her, and he addressed her in these terms.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.800]   "Hail thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.320]   Blessed art thou among women."
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   Why?
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.360]   Well, he goes on, you see.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   "Behold thou shalt conceive, thou fear not Mary, thou hast found favour with God.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.280]   And behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.600]   name Jesus.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.640]   He shall be great, and shall be called the son of the highest.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.760]   And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.840]   the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   That's it.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.920]   Glory, rejoicing, "Hail thou that art highly favoured."
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.800]   This is good news, this is something thrilling, this is something astounding.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:29.720]   Then listen to Mary herself, as she addresses Elizabeth on this selfsame question.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.920]   She speaks in exactly the same manner.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.960]   She speaks out with a loud voice and says, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.340]   is the fruit of thy womb."
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.340]   And so on.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:48.640]   She says, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.240]   For he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.640]   For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.680]   For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.960]   And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.760]   He hath showed strength with his arm, he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   their hearts.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.120]   He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.080]   He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.920]   He hath opened his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy, as he spake to our fathers,
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.440]   to Abraham, and to his seed for ever."
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.120]   And then, for me not to keep you with this, you may not have remembered those passages,
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.600]   you may never have heard them before.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.840]   But everybody has heard about the shepherds in their field at night, tending to their
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.080]   flock as usual.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.140]   And how suddenly there appeared to them a host of hymnal beings singing.
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.120]   And what were they singing?
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:55.360]   "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill amongst men."
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.360]   Hark!
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.600]   The herald angels sing, "Glory to the newborn King."
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.960]   You see, this is something which is introduced like that.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.160]   It's good news.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.560]   The angels are singing.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.720]   The heralds are shouting.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.040]   Everybody, archangels and angels, everybody is interested in this.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.720]   Well, it is the most amazing and astounding good news that has ever come to the world
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   of men.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.760]   Now, my friend, is that your habitual way of thinking of Christianity?
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.160]   Or have you just thought of it of going to chapel or church on Sunday?
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.320]   Perhaps you've been made to go up till now, brought up like this, sent to the Sunday school,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.360]   made to go with your parents to a church or a chapel, and you hated the whole thing, and
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.720]   you didn't want to do it, and you say, "Now, at last I'm free.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.960]   I'm going to do it no more."
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   Is that your idea?
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.960]   Listen.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.960]   You don't know what it is.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   You know nothing about it.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.120]   You are not rejecting Christianity.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.520]   You are rejecting something else.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.240]   What you think is Christianity, this is Christianity.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   Hark!
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:54.960]   The herald angels sing, "Glory to the newborn King.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.280]   Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill amongst men."
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.400]   This amazing thing has happened.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   What is this?
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:10.520]   Very well, my friends, this is the first point we must always be clear about.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:17.640]   If your thinking about Christianity isn't in terms of this glorious news, if you don't
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.480]   understand what the Scripture means when it says, "The people that sat in darkness have
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.800]   seen a great light," you know nothing about it.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   That's Christianity.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.360]   That's the fulfillment of that prophecy.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.640]   The people that sat in darkness have suddenly seen a great light, and they're filled with
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.800]   joy the way out is being shown.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.080]   That's Christianity.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.880]   You see, John the Baptist, later on when he begins his ministry, says the same thing.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   John was preaching to the people, and they said, "We've never heard anybody like this
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   before.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880]   This is marvelous.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.440]   This must be the Christ.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.400]   This must be the long-accepted Messiah."
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.920]   John heard them, and he turned to them, and he said, "I am not the Christ.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.360]   I am unworthy to undo the lecher of your shoes.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:09.400]   I indeed baptize you with water, but he, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.440]   with fire, whose fan is in his hand.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.840]   And he shall throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner, but the
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:27.840]   He shall die, I'm a forerunner, I'm merely the introducer, I'm the prologue, he."
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.440]   Now, my friends, this is Christianity.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.120]   And all these other writers who come later, they all describe it in the same way.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.080]   The Apostle Paul, describing this Gospel in a phrase, calls it the glorious Gospel of
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.400]   the Blessed God, or the Gospel of the glory of the Blessed God, whichever you like.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:51.480]   "Great is the mystery of godliness, God was manifested in the flesh," and so on.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.200]   That's Christianity.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:00.840]   Good news, the greatest and the most wonderful good news that has ever come into this world
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.800]   that men can ever hear, something thrilling in its immensity and in its glory.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.760]   Is that our way of thinking of it?
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:15.360]   "You," says Paul to these Colossians, "you received and believed the word of the
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   true Gospel."
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   It's Gospel.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.840]   But let me hurry to my second point, which is this, it's the true Gospel.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.520]   Now this is a very crucial point.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.240]   Why does the Apostle emphasize this?
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.280]   I've already told you.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.640]   He said, "You, where have ye heard in the word of the truth of the Gospel, where have
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.720]   ye heard in the word of the true Gospel?"
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.240]   He emphasizes that for the reason I gave you at the beginning, he's contrasting it with
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.080]   the false teachings.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.720]   He's contrasting it with that other teaching that was trying to muddle these people at
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.880]   Colossae and everywhere else.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.960]   He says that's not true, this is the only true Gospel.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.360]   You mustn't listen to that, you must only listen to this.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.280]   Now then, here's a crucial point.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.120]   What right is he to speak like that?
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.800]   And that is the question that many are asking at the present time.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.200]   They say, "What's your authority for preaching as you do?"
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   I'm often asked that.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.600]   They say, "Now, are your other people saying this, that, and the other?
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.720]   Are your people denying the virgin birth and the unique deity of Christ, but still calling
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   themselves Christians?
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.200]   How do you know you are right and they are wrong?"
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.440]   That's what they're saying.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.360]   They say, "You believe in miracles, these other people don't believe in miracles.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.400]   You say that we are saved by Christ dying for us on the cross, those other people don't
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.400]   say that."
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.400]   They say, "Christ was the death of a pacifist."
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.840]   "You say he literally rose in the body from the grave."
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.600]   They say he didn't, but that his spirit went on influencing these people.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   How do you know you're right?
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.160]   How do I know what to believe?
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.160]   Who's right?
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.040]   Isn't it one man's word against another and isn't one as good as another?
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.680]   Now that's the position, isn't it?
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.960]   I'm sure there are many in this congregation who are thinking just like that at this very
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   moment.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   They say, "That man is so dogmatic.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.920]   He says he alone is right, that's arrogance."
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.800]   Is it?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.400]   Was the Apostle Paul arrogant?
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.720]   Is he right to say this?
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:07.480]   "You've heard the word of the true gospel, the other is the false gospel."
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.440]   What right does he have to speak like this?
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.640]   What right does anyone have to speak and to repeat his message?
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.160]   What right did Epaphras have to preach as he had done at Colossae?
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.200]   What is the test?
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.680]   What is the authority?
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.360]   How may we know what we are to believe and what we are not to believe amidst the welter
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.560]   of theories and ideas that are in the church as well as outside the church, alas, unfortunately?
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.840]   Well, let me try to answer the question in the very terms the Apostle puts it.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:40.320]   Here are some of the tests which we must always apply when we are concerned about this matter
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.520]   of authority and when we would know that we've got the true gospel for certain.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:52.400]   The first point is that it is not a human philosophy and speculation.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.800]   I mean this.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.160]   Human beings speculate, human beings have great abilities, some of them, and they are
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.760]   great philosophers and great thinkers.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:08.960]   But you see, when one such man comes and says, "I do not believe that anything happens
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   to us after death."
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.440]   Now, a young man read that out to me in a book in my vestry last Sunday night at the
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.440]   close of the service.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.680]   He says, "This is what this great philosopher says.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.360]   He says when a man dies, that's the end.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.240]   I do not believe in a future life, I do not believe in the soul."
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.240]   He says, "Here it is.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.240]   What do you say to that?"
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.120]   Well, all I say to that is this, that that is nothing but that particular philosopher's
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.760]   opinion, nothing more.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.760]   That's what he thinks.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.320]   He can't prove it, he can't demonstrate it.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.600]   He's got no authority for it whatsoever except that that is what he thinks.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   Right?
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   But I'll add that to this.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.760]   I'll add something to that.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.200]   He is not the only man who thinks things like that.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.280]   There are many men who have never read a textbook on philosophy.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.560]   They say exactly the same thing.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.320]   And they're equally entitled to say it because it's a matter of opinion with these people.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.040]   None of them know, none of them can prove.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.440]   They've got no authority except that they say so, they think it.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.480]   And people, intelligent young people, intelligent young men like the men who read out of the
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.760]   book to me are ready to accept it simply because so and so says it.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.920]   I'm not in this pulpit tonight simply to voice my opinions and ideas.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.080]   I'm not here just to repeat anybody else's.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.400]   Let me tell you what I am doing.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.800]   But there's your first test.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   What's it based on?
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.640]   What right does a man to make his statement?
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.000]   Is it merely a human philosophy, a human speculation?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.800]   Or let me give you another negative test.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:38.400]   You'll find so many people saying today, "Well, of course, I can't accept your gospel.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.480]   You say that God hates sin and that God punishes sinners.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.880]   I can't believe in a God who's capable of that.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.280]   I believe God is love and I believe God loves everybody and I believe everybody's going
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   to God and to heaven.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.560]   I don't believe in your punishment and retribution.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   I don't believe in your atonement, therefore."
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.840]   Now, what about them?
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:02.160]   Well, you see the position there is this, isn't it?
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.680]   They again are basing their whole position upon what they think and what they can believe
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.560]   and what they can't believe.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.360]   I can't believe that God…
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.480]   But on what grounds?
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.240]   No grounds at all.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.840]   Do they know God?
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.120]   Have they ever discussed it with God?
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.680]   Do they know the mind of God?
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   Of course they don't.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.560]   All they're doing is, "I can't possibly believe that."
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.680]   Because they assert it, we are expected to believe it.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.000]   But you see, that's nothing again but a human opinion.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.680]   Now, there are men doing that with the Bible and calling themselves Christians.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.840]   They cannot accept this, that and the other in the Old Testament and the New.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.840]   But why can't they?
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.120]   Well, it's only that they can't.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.120]   It's their opinion.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.360]   It's nothing else at all.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.240]   There's no sanction, no authority, no basis for it whatsoever.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.920]   It's simply that they can't.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.920]   Very well.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.760]   We'll accept that they can't, but it doesn't tell me anything except that they can't.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.480]   It doesn't tell me anything about the truth itself.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.640]   You're back still on the level of human opinion.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.640]   So that is not the basis of authority.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.480]   Because if that's the basis of authority, well, then every man is his own authority.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.320]   And if I can't believe a thing, it isn't true.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   Well, then another man can.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   It is.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.320]   Well, there you are.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   You can't believe a thing at all, and you've got no belief, you've got no authority whatsoever.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.200]   Chaos.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.960]   One other thing I must add at this negative point, and it's the last I put here negatively,
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.720]   is this.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:30.400]   We must be very careful about what is called tradition.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.720]   A man once said that every institution tends to produce its opposite.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.200]   And there's a great deal of truth in that.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.960]   Every institution tends to produce its opposite.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.080]   He meant this, you see, Christianity starts, as I say, as a group of people in houses.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.000]   Nothing institutional about it at all.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.840]   But the church has become, what, a great world institution.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.940]   You remember how Protestantism began?
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.640]   What is Protestantism by today?
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.920]   Look at some of the things that are said in the name of Protestantism in the church in
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.920]   England at the present time.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.900]   It's become the exact opposite.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.520]   Look at the beginning of nonconformity 300 years ago.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.520]   Look at modern nonconformity.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.360]   It's almost the exact opposite.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.600]   Look at Methodism 200 years ago.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.320]   Look at Methodism tonight.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.240]   How much of it would John Wesley recognize?
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.880]   Institutions tend to produce their opposite.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   How?
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.280]   Well, you see, over the passage of the years, changes come in, tradition develops, and tradition
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   becomes more important than truth.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.680]   Now you read your Gospels and you'll find that the Lord Jesus Christ was fighting about
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   that throughout.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.920]   He says, "Look here, to these Pharisees, you are worshipping the traditions of men.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.440]   You are putting aside the law of God.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.360]   You are worshipping men's teachings, men's traditions."
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.400]   That's exactly what had happened.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:50.480]   These so-called experts on the law of God were hiding and concealing the law of God
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:56.000]   from the people with their vain traditions.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.280]   So I ask you, if you are concerned about this question of authority, to make quite sure
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.880]   that you are not just taking some tradition that has developed, something that you've
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.120]   been brought up in.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.160]   I stand for no denominations, my friends.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.360]   I'm not interested in them.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.760]   I'm not here to defend any one of them.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.760]   I'm here to say, "What is the original thing?
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   What is the truth?
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.680]   What is the word of salvation?"
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.240]   Institutions generally stand between people and the truth.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   Not tradition, then.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   Well, what then?
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.360]   What is the thing that gave the Apostle Paul the right to say, "This is the true Gospel
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.520]   and not that other?"
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.120]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.320]   Historical events.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.480]   Historical events.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.040]   Why did these Apostles start preaching at all?
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   Whatever made them preach?
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   Look at this man, Paul.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.560]   He was a Pharisee, trained as a Pharisee, brought up as one, and a very able one, one
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.560]   of the greatest of them all.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.480]   Suddenly, he leaves it all and becomes a preacher of this Gospel.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.400]   What made him do it?
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.160]   What made Epaphras ever go to Colossae and preach his Gospel?
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   What is the basis?
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.160]   What's the background?
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.880]   What's the authority on what is the whole thing built up and established?
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.560]   And the answer is, historical facts.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.040]   It isn't a theory.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.240]   It isn't a teaching.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.400]   It isn't a philosophy.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.040]   It isn't a human program.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.720]   Certain events have taken place.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.760]   Listen to the way the Apostle Peter puts it at the end of his life as an old man.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:28.120]   He says, "You know, we have not declared unto you cunningly devised fables when we
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:33.320]   declared unto you the power and the coming of the Lord Jesus, but where I, witnesses
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   of his majesty."
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   That's it.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.800]   "You listen to what I'm saying," says Peter as an old man.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.440]   "I haven't been weaving wonderful tales to you.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:47.080]   I haven't been getting round you and moving your hearts with stories and a very clever
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.880]   philosophy and psychology that I've been working up to make you feel a little bit happier
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   and better.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.280]   I have not delivered unto you cunningly devised fables when I declared unto you the power
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:01.840]   and the coming of the Lord Jesus, but I and these others were eyewitnesses of his majesty,
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.800]   and we heard that voice coming from the excellent glory saying, 'This is my beloved Son in
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.880]   whom I am well pleased.'"
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.300]   Now then, this is the argument.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.820]   This is the whole basis.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.400]   This is the authority for what I'm trying to say to you.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:21.760]   The fact of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.480]   That's what's caused it all.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.800]   That's where it all comes from.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.760]   A babe born in Bethlehem.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.520]   You remember the annunciation and the shepherds and the worshipping and the wise men.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.360]   Who is this child?
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.840]   You see, this is the explanation.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.280]   This is how it all begins.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.560]   That extraordinary birth and then that boy at the age of twelve.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:46.920]   There he is in the temple at Jerusalem arguing with the great doctors of the law, refuting
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.560]   them, turning their arguments back and they couldn't answer him.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.420]   And everybody says, "What is this boy?
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.560]   This is a phenomenon.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.560]   What is he?"
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.440]   Then for eighteen years you hear nothing about him.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.360]   He went on working as a carpenter.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.320]   Who is this?
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.000]   And then at the age of thirty he begins to preach and to teach.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.600]   He goes back to his hometown of Nazareth and enters there into the synagogue on a Sunday.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.960]   They give him the book to read, the first chapter of Isaiah, and he expounds it and
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.480]   they were amazed at the gracious words which came over his lips.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.040]   His preaching, his teaching, his miracles.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.320]   He attracted great crowds.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   Why?
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.140]   Well, because he could heal people.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.480]   He could heal the sick.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.720]   He could give sight to the blind.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.920]   He could make the lame walk and jump.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.480]   He could give the deaf the deaf hearing.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.880]   He could raise the dead.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.040]   He could calm a storm at sea.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.320]   And he was a phenomenon and the crowds went after him.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.320]   Who is this?
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   That's the question.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   Who is this?
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.240]   What is this person?
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:50.400]   And then listen to the claims he makes for himself.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:56.180]   He stands and he says, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.980]   He says, "I am the Father, I am one."
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.040]   He says, "I am the way, the truth, the life.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.360]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.920]   All who came before me," he says, "are thieves and robbers.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.760]   I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly."
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   Who is this?
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.520]   Here is the thing that gives rise to Christianity.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.640]   You see, it isn't your opinion about war or peace or a thousand and one other questions
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.040]   and your living of your good life.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   No, forget it all.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   Look at him.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   Who is this?
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.040]   Who is this person?
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.040]   What is he?
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.040]   How do you explain him?
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.040]   He is a fact of history.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.320]   He is a phenomenon.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.160]   And listen to him as he tells you why he ever came into this world.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:47.880]   He says, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:53.520]   Listen to him saying again, "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto but to minister
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:58.000]   and to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   What is this?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Who is he?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.900]   His friends say, "Look here, don't go up to Jerusalem.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.320]   You know that Herod hates you.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.120]   You know they are trying to catch you."
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   Sets his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   They can't keep him back.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   He says, "I must.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.120]   I must.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   I've come to do this.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   The hour is about to strike.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.600]   The hour is come."
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.320]   Who is this, my friend?
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.200]   This is how you approach Christianity.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.240]   That's what sent Epaphras down to Colossae.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.280]   This person, this man who said these things and who did these things.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.600]   Not only that, you see, as the quotations I read to you just now, every one of them
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:38.680]   point out, all that is true of this person and that happens in him and through him is
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.120]   a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.480]   Here's a mighty argument.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   If you want to know my authority, here it is.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.280]   Here's a great old book, the Old Testament, covering a number of centuries and there in
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.640]   every single book there is some prophecy about someone who is going to come, some deliverer,
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.840]   someone who is going to set his people free.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.240]   You notice Zechariah quoted it.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.720]   You notice Mary quoted it.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.720]   The angels quoted it.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.840]   Everybody is quoting it.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:11.320]   The prophecies as was promised to Abraham, our father, as was promised to David, prophecy.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.720]   The Apostle Peter once more implies that self-same argument.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.120]   He says, "I tell you that I was on that mount of transfiguration with him and James and
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.120]   John were with me and we saw him transfigured.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.640]   His face began to shine.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.840]   His very clothing began to shine and a voice came from him saying, 'This is my beloved
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   son.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.840]   He was born to be free.'
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.720]   'For that sake,' says Peter, 'but I'll give you a stronger reason.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.940]   We have also a more sure word of prophecy.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.440]   We have also a word of prophecy made more sure."
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.440]   He means this.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.160]   He says, "Don't merely take it on my testimony.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.160]   Look at the life of this Jesus.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.760]   Read your prophecies and you'll see that he's the fulfillment.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   They said he was to be born in Bethlehem and he was.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.080]   They said he was to ride in Jerusalem on the foal of an ass and he did it.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:00.200]   They said he was to be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver and he was.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.720]   Read your Old Testament.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.480]   Pick out what we are told about this coming Messiah.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.040]   Then look at him and you'll find it tallies perfectly.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.440]   All the promises of God in him are 'Yea' and in him 'Amen.'
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.520]   There's authority.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.520]   It isn't what I think.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.800]   It isn't what anybody thinks.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.840]   It's this extraordinary fact of history, fulfillment of prophecy."
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:27.560]   "But wait a minute," says someone, "this great person of yours died on a cross in apparent
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   weakness.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.560]   Why didn't he save himself?
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:35.600]   If he is, as you say, the Son of God, why did he die in such unutterable weakness?"
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.320]   "My dear friend, you're not the first who thought of that.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.200]   The people mingling round about the foot of that cross.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.000]   The crowd as they saw him crucified between the two thieves.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   You remember they hurled it at him and said, 'Thou shall not be saved.'"
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.960]   "You remember they hurled it at him and said, 'Thou who savest others, save thyself.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.600]   Thou who says thou art the Christ, give a demonstration of it.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   Who are you?'
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.240]   They hurled it in his teeth, we are told.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.000]   He died upon a cross.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.240]   His body was taken down and it was buried in a grave.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.480]   That's fact of history.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.720]   That's something that actually happened.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.360]   But you see, it isn't the end of the story.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.800]   If that had been the end of the story, Epaphras would never have gone to Colossae.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.440]   The Apostle Paul would never have been a preacher.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.680]   None of the apostles would ever have preached at all.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   What made them?
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.760]   Oh, he died, he was buried, he was laid in a grave, the stone was rolled on, the seal
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.640]   was put, the soldiers were guarding.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.600]   But he burst us under the bends of death.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.200]   He arose triumphant over the grave.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.360]   He brought life and immortality to light.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.800]   Here's the most striking proof of all.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.080]   Listen to this Apostle Paul saying it to the Romans.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.520]   He says, "Born according to the flesh after the seed of David, but declared to be the
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:54.800]   Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead."
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.400]   Here's the thing.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.480]   He rose, he appeared to his followers, these disciples, these apostles and others, and
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:07.280]   still more wonderfully, on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, he sent down the Spirit upon
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.280]   them.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.280]   He promised he would.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.960]   He said, "It's all right, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.520]   I'll send you another comforter.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.760]   This is vital, this is crucial.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.480]   Here isn't one, apparently, just a man who's about to die."
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.640]   He says, "Don't let your hearts be troubled.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.240]   I'm leaving you, that's going to be a good thing for you, because if I go, I'm going
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.800]   to send the Holy Ghost to you, and he'll be in you, and he'll bring me back to you in
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.760]   a more real sense, and he'll enlighten your minds and open your understandings.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.800]   It'll be a good thing for you that I'm going away.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   I'll send the Spirit."
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.680]   Then after his resurrection he repeated that.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.880]   He says, "Look here, you men, you are going to be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Samaria
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.080]   and to the uttermost parts of the earth, but not yet.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:51.200]   Tarry ye in Jerusalem, tarry in Jerusalem until you receive power from on high.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.920]   You shall receive him, and when you've got him, you'll go out and you'll be my witnesses
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.680]   to the uttermost parts of the earth."
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.960]   And as he'd promised and predicted, he fulfilled it on the day of Pentecost.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.240]   These are facts, my friends.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.280]   There would never have been a church at Colossae, there would never have been a preacher, were
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.760]   it not for these facts.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.560]   This is the basis, this is the authority.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.400]   Not that I can't believe this or that, not that I can't accept this or that.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.320]   These things have happened, these are facts.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.080]   I can't explain the church at Colossae without them.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:26.560]   But then you see, that brings me to the testimony of the apostles.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.920]   These men had been with him during the three years, they'd heard his preaching, they'd
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.920]   seen his miracles.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:38.000]   They'd stood at the foot of that cross and had seen him dying, and they'd seen him after
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.760]   his death and resurrection.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   They were met together in a room filled with fear, with all the doors locked because of
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.560]   the Jews, and suddenly he stands amongst them.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   He says, "Look here, don't be alarmed, I'm not a ghost.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.120]   A ghost hasn't got flesh and bones as you see me have."
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:58.120]   He sat down and he ate a bit of fish and broiled honey, proving that he's the same person in
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:03.520]   his glorified body amongst them.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.440]   These men are witnesses of these things.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.360]   You remember how crestfallen and disappointed and dejected they were when he died and when
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.480]   he was buried?
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.940]   They thought the end had come in spite of his teaching.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.200]   But once they saw him, once they knew he was alive forevermore, and still more when he
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:22.640]   filled them and baptized them with his spirit on the day of Pentecost, they were transformed
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   men.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.680]   They went out and they testified.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.920]   The authorities tried to stop them.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.000]   They said, "You can't stop us.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.040]   We cannot but speak of the things we have seen and heard, not our theories, not our
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.040]   philosophies.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.400]   We cannot but speak of the things we have seen and the things that we have heard.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.240]   We are witnesses unto him."
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.520]   He gave them power to work miracles and the people were ready to worship him.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.960]   They said, "Don't worship us.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:48.760]   It's his name, through faith in his name, that has given these men this perfect soundness
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.600]   in the presence of you all."
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.240]   That's what made these men preachers.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.040]   The things they had seen and heard, and the power that came to declare it through the
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   Holy Spirit.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.640]   And look at this man, Paul.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.200]   He wasn't one of the disciples.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.120]   As I've told you, he was a Pharisee and he hated Christ.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.140]   He hated these apostles, they're called.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.120]   He wasn't in the company and he did everything he could to put an end to it.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.040]   He tried to destroy Christianity.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.560]   He went to massacre Christian churches.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:21.080]   And yet here he is as a minister and a preacher of this gospel.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.320]   How did it ever happen to him?
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.240]   And he tells us, he says it several times over in the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.600]   when he's on defense.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.680]   It's the fact that he saw him.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.440]   He saw him on that road to Damascus.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.440]   He didn't have a vision.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.320]   He saw the risen Lord in his glory.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.880]   He saw him as certainly as the other apostles had seen him in the upper room and on the
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.960]   seashore.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.320]   He was given a glimpse of him.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   What for?
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.040]   Well, he's going to be a minister and a witness and an apostle.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.800]   He's a witness to the resurrection.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.560]   He has seen Christ risen from the dead.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.440]   It's this fact that makes him preach.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.120]   It isn't the teaching, it isn't the theory.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.280]   He's seen him.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.440]   He testifies.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.560]   He bears witness to the fact of the resurrection.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.600]   And he was given the teaching by the Lord, the same teaching as was given to these others.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.440]   They all taught the same thing.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.520]   It wasn't the theory of Paul or of John.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:18.400]   They all had the same message because they were all given it by the same person.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:25.240]   And what the apostle is saying here is this, that that is the message that was preached
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.320]   by Epaphras.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.800]   It's the true gospel.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.440]   And therefore I end with this point.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.880]   He says it's the only gospel.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:41.520]   "For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.640]   of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you as it is in all the world, and bringeth
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.240]   forth fruit as it doth also in you everywhere throughout the whole world."
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.720]   He means this, you see.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.320]   It is the only gospel.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.080]   And it must be the only gospel for this reason.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   Everything else is but the thinking and the theory of men.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.920]   And that's why every other religion is a local religion.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.240]   Had you ever thought of that?
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:18.600]   Buddhism, confined to China; Buddhism, confined to parts of China and of India; Hinduism,
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.880]   confined to India; Mohammedanism, North Africa and certain other parts.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.880]   All religions are local religions.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:32.560]   And it's not surprising that they are, because every one of them has started with a human
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   teacher.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:39.320]   They're all the products of human thinking, human imagination and human ideas.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.280]   You get a great man arising in a certain area, and of course he influences that immediate
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   area.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:48.000]   They're local religions, not this one, in the whole world.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Why?
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.880]   Well, this one is the saviour of the world.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.200]   He is not a man.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.680]   This is the Son of God come down.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.200]   That's why the herald angels are singing.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.520]   They know that the Lord of glory has left heaven and has come on earth.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.800]   That's why they all burst forth in acclamation.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.640]   That's the good news, that God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:15.040]   It's universal because it's of God, because the Son of God has come, and there's only
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.040]   one.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.080]   It's not man trying to rise, it's God coming down in the sun to save us and to lift us
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.080]   up.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.560]   It's the only gospel.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:29.280]   And that is why the apostle Peter, you see, didn't hesitate to say to the authorities,
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:35.600]   "There is none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved."
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.120]   There's no second, there's no other, there is no other saviour.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:44.960]   This is God's way in his own Son, and there's only one, one name and one only given under
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:50.920]   heaven amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:57.480]   And it was for that same reason that this apostle Paul, in writing to the Galatians,
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:04.360]   used this expression, "Though we are an angel from heaven, write any other gospel unto you
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.760]   than that which we have written.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.760]   Let him be accursed."
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:15.160]   "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.240]   we have preached.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.080]   Let him be anathema, let him be accursed."
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:25.960]   Listen to this, says Paul, "If anybody comes to preach to you and preaches a gospel that
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:32.560]   is different from this gospel which I preach to you, let him be accursed.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.960]   He's a liar, he's a false teacher."
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:45.080]   Indeed, he goes further, "Though we," he says, "you know, even if I come to you, if I come
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.680]   to you one day," says Paul, "and I contradict what I said before, well, you can be sure
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.520]   of one of two things.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:57.880]   I've either become an apostate or else I've become a lunatic.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.120]   Don't believe me.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.640]   I shall be uttering a lie.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:07.080]   This is the one and only gospel."
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080]   Why does he say that?
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.080]   Is it because his opinion?
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.080]   No, no.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.920]   It's because he was given it, not by the teaching of men, as he goes on to say in Galatians
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.520]   1, but from Christ himself.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.440]   He was given it on the road to Damascus.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.760]   If it had been his opinion, he wouldn't speak like that.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.280]   It would have been sheer arrogance.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.640]   He says, "I am certain of this because it isn't mine.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.200]   It's because I have received it.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.920]   I certify you, brethren, that the gospel that you have received of me is not after
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.920]   men."
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:44.440]   It's not after men, but as it is in truth and in deed, it is from God himself.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:49.160]   He says, "Even if an angel from heaven should come and contradict what I'm saying or offer
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:53.440]   you some other gospel or theory, it may sound very wonderful and very comforting and full
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.280]   of philosophy and psychology.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.960]   Tell him to his face that he's a liar.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   Let him be anathema.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:04.760]   Let him come under the curse of God because it's a lie."
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:14.680]   The word of the true gospel, which has come unto you as it is in the whole world, Christ
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:25.400]   the Son of God, the Savior of the world, the revelation of God himself in the person of
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.560]   his only begotten Son.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.160]   My friends, this is why it's good news.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.920]   This is why these people are thrilled in that way.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.280]   Why you see, even the hymn writers, they join in it.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.160]   Did you notice that hymn which we sang just now, that hymn number 74?
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:44.480]   "Hark the glad sound, the Savior comes, the Savior promised long.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:51.800]   Let every heart prepare a throne and every voice a song."
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.080]   Have you got that song?
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.960]   Are you singing his prayers?
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:03.560]   Have you ever felt like saying, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   praise."
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.220]   If you haven't, it's because you don't know him.
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.220]   You don't know the truth.
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.280]   You don't know the message.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   You don't know the facts.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.280]   You don't know your history.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.160]   You've got a false notion of Christianity.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.760]   If you realize that God has so loved you and so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.720]   Son even to the death of that cross, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.520]   but have everlasting life, if you realize that that's true to you, you're bound to
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.960]   sing.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:36.160]   Because it means that God's ready to forgive you and the door of heaven is open to you
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:41.120]   and you'll start living a new life such as you cannot even imagine, which you can't
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.280]   imagine now and which nobody else will be able to understand until he becomes a partaker
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.280]   of it.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.480]   Very well, my friends, there is the general description which the great apostle gives
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   of the gospel.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.040]   I leave you with this question.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:02.440]   Is this to you the greatest, the most glorious, the most thrilling, the most wonderful thing
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.600]   that you've ever heard, that you can ever hear?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:16.120]   If it isn't, I say you don't know what Christianity is and you're not a Christian.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.720]   And not to be a Christian means that you're yet in your sins and that you're under the
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:25.920]   wrath of God and that if you die like that you'll go to an eternity of a similar nature
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.200]   of misery and wretchedness and unhappiness.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.760]   My friend, stop for a moment.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.000]   Face the facts.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:43.360]   Face these events in history that led to Epaphras going to Colossae and receive them as these
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:49.200]   people at Colossae did and you'll become a saint and one of the faithful brethren and
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:55.360]   the gospel will begin to bring forth fruit in you as it did in them and in all others
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.920]   who ever had believed it.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:02.040]   Very well, I say, face the facts and if you do so honestly and if you ask the Holy Spirit
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:06.600]   to enlighten you, I assure you the day will come when you'll be very ready to join in
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.320]   singing our last hymn which is 163.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.480]   All hail the power of Jesus' name.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:22.840]   Let angels, thrust with all, bring forth the royal diadem to crown him Lord of all.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:32.680]   Hymn number 163.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:45.240]   All hail the power of Jesus' name.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:59.240]   Let angels, thrust with all, bring forth the royal diadem to crown him Lord of all.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:22.040]   All hail the power of Jesus' name.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:25.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
