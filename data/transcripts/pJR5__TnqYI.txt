[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   - Well, we get many questions from boyfriends
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.960]   and girlfriends who are trying to discern
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.240]   God's will in a spouse.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.120]   What types of things are marriage deal breakers?
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.060]   And that's the theme of today's question,
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.120]   a really important one from a young man.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.380]   Dear Pastor John, I have been with my girlfriend
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.680]   for eight months now, and I believe that she could be
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.920]   the one God has for me.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.440]   She loves Jesus and shows it in many ways.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.040]   The next step in our relationship is marriage.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.080]   We both love each other dearly,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.560]   and we would both be excited to be married together.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.200]   However, there is only one thing that stops me.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.520]   She has told me on several occasions
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.760]   she does not believe homosexuality is a sin.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.880]   I point her to Romans 1, 26, 27,
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.480]   but she gives me no indication she will back down from this.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.380]   Is this a deal breaker for our relationship?
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.980]   Yes, it is a deal breaker.
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.860]   Now, before I say why, remember,
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.560]   before you are married, you have an awesome privilege
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.700]   of marrying or not marrying.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.420]   It's not a sin to break off an engagement
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.420]   for biblical, godly reasons, but once you are married,
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.420]   what she believes can't end the marriage.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.420]   You're not free to put asunder what God has joined together.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.400]   You make your vows, form a holy covenant,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.300]   make promises for better or for worse,
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.300]   till death do us part, and that means for worse, beliefs.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.380]   She may cease to believe in Jesus at all
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.840]   after you're married. She may become a Satanist.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.220]   She may become a witch, a real witch.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.900]   She's your wife by sacred covenant before God,
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.460]   and he's the one who created the union, not you.
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.020]   What God has joined together, let no one put asunder,
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.440]   but for now, you're not bound to her in this way,
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.740]   and I'm arguing you should not be.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.800]   Now, why would I say that?
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Here's what you say.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.960]   She has told me on several occasions
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.780]   she doesn't believe homosexuality is a sin.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.740]   I assume you mean homosexual activity is a sin.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.140]   I point her to Romans 1, 26 and 27,
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.600]   but she gives me no indication that she will back down.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.860]   Now, I'm gonna give you five reasons
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.820]   why I think that's a deal breaker for marriage,
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.120]   and I'll put them in the order
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.820]   that I think is least important
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.800]   and end on the one that I think's most important.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.260]   I might be wrong about the order,
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.580]   but each of them I think is valid.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.000]   Number one, differences between you like this
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.420]   will create enormous pressures and tensions
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.220]   when it comes to teaching your children right and wrong.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.180]   It's one thing to say, "Mommy likes coffee
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.100]   and Daddy doesn't."
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.260]   It is massively different to say,
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.260]   "Mommy believes two boys kissing and having sex is good
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.300]   and Daddy thinks it's evil."
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.620]   This will be incredibly disorienting to the children
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.700]   and make them baffled about how to form
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.420]   important moral convictions.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.180]   And not only will it be morally damaging,
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.180]   I think to the children at that very point,
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.420]   it will be deeply aggravating between the two of you.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.620]   I know from experience how differences between me and Noelle
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.380]   were magnified tenfold when it came to how we would
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.900]   influence the kids with those differences.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.260]   Your way or my way.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.100]   And we never had any disagreements coming close to this one.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.940]   So that's number one, the kids.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.940]   Number two, if you disagree on something so visceral,
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.460]   so explosive, so rooted in Christian history
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.800]   and in scripture, it is virtually certain
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.140]   you will have other serious clashes.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.740]   It is almost impossible to imagine that such a disagreement
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.860]   could exist in isolation from others.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.680]   If they haven't come out yet, they will.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   You may feel like you can stash this difference in a silo
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.660]   and segregate it from your daily interactions.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.420]   I think that's incredibly naive.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.000]   It won't stay in a silo.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.060]   And even if it did, it will prove symptomatic
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.620]   of other deep differences that will eventually come out.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.220]   Number three, the reason for this inability
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.220]   to silo this difference, the reason is that convictions
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.040]   like this, one way or the other, don't float
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.320]   in your mind like clouds.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.880]   They have roots.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.160]   They come from somewhere.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.060]   These roots include deep spiritual
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.360]   and moral instincts and inclinations.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.380]   And the fact that she can affirm homosexual activity
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.380]   and you can't signal deep, deep differences
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.440]   in what your most basic moral spiritual instincts are.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.280]   The spiritual roots of her and your convictions
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.920]   are very different.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.520]   And roots do not just bear one branch.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.060]   They bear all kinds of branches and fruit.
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.720]   When the roots of spiritual instincts
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.020]   and inclinations are different,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.020]   there is no predicting what the fruit differences might be.
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.140]   Number four, close to the most important issue
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.060]   is biblical authority and clarity in your lives.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.460]   She may or may not give assent
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.880]   to the infallibility of scripture.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.580]   And she may say that it has final authority
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.640]   in all her decisions and convictions,
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   but all of that is for naught if there's a deep resistance
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.660]   to what the Bible teaches, so that she finds ways
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.480]   of making the Bible mean something
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.780]   that it just doesn't mean.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.940]   Or simply ignoring the Bible and going with a vague sense
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.340]   of what love is.
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.580]   In other words, I cannot imagine that you
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.580]   and your girlfriend have the same deep, heartfelt conviction
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.380]   about the authority and preciousness of the Bible,
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.980]   and about its practical place in governing your thoughts
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.020]   and feelings and actions.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.720]   That's a deal breaker if you love the word of God
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.500]   for what it really is, and submit to it
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.300]   as the guide of all of your life, when she doesn't.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.660]   Finally, even more important than that authority
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.500]   of scripture is what this authority says, what it teaches.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.300]   And what it teaches is not just
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.580]   that homosexual activity is wrong,
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.500]   but that it signals you're headed for eternal destruction.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.580]   Here's 1 Corinthians 6, 9.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.900]   Do you not know that the unrighteous
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.500]   will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.420]   Do not be deceived.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.380]   Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters,
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.280]   nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.000]   nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.180]   nor revilers, nor swindlers,
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.580]   will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.020]   What this means is that your girlfriend is wrong,
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.980]   not just about the rightness of an act,
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.940]   but about whether the pattern of those acts
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.780]   forms the path that leads to hell.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.060]   Paul says that the gospel is given
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.220]   so that people can escape that path of destruction.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.420]   The next verse says, "Such were some of you."
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.700]   In other words, you were active participants
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.860]   in a life of homosexuality, but you're not anymore.
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.980]   Such were some of you, but you were washed,
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.260]   you were sanctified, you were justified
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.280]   in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.460]   and by the Spirit of our God.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.220]   But to approve of the very pattern of life
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.340]   that the gospel is designed to save you from
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.340]   is to oppose the gospel and promote destruction.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.500]   I don't see how you can believe this
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   and move forward with the deepest
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.940]   and most precious union of souls and bodies
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.460]   that exist on the planet among human beings.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.740]   It's a deal breaker.
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.300]   - Indeed, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.700]   Speaking of God's will and finding it,
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.100]   if the disciples flipped a coin to hear God's will,
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.260]   can we do the same thing when we are faced
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.740]   with a big life decision?
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.260]   That's the question over casting lots.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.220]   It's a good one, and it's up next on Wednesday
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.100]   when we return to listen to our over 1,300 past episodes.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.760]   Now today, go to our online home
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.220]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.180]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.020]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.180]   (upbeat music)
