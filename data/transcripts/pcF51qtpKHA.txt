[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.760]   - Jumping back to Feynman just for a second,
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.180]   he had a little bit of an ego.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.320]   (laughing)
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.200]   - Yes.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.560]   - Why, do you think ego is powerful or dangerous in science?
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.280]   - I think both, both, both.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.920]   I think you have to have both arrogance and humility.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.040]   You have to have the arrogance to say, I can do this.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.040]   Nature is difficult, nature is very, very hard.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.560]   I'm smart enough, I can do it.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.400]   I can win the battle with nature.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.440]   On the other hand, I think you also have to have
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.440]   the humility to know that you're very likely to be wrong
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.460]   on any given occasion.
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.460]   Everything you're thinking could suddenly change.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.920]   Young people can come along and say things
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.360]   you won't understand and you'll be lost and flabbergasted.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.020]   So I think it's a combination of both.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.160]   You better recognize that you're very limited
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.680]   and you better be able to say to yourself,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.920]   I'm not so limited that I can't win this battle with nature.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.040]   It takes a special kind of person
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.240]   who can manage both of those, I would say.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.440]   - And I would say there's echoes of that in your own work,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.400]   a little bit of ego, a little bit of
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.260]   outside of the box, humble thinking.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.000]   - I hope so.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   - So was there a time where you felt,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.500]   you looked at yourself and asked,
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.340]   am I completely wrong about this?
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.400]   - Oh yeah, about the whole thing or about specific things?
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   - The whole thing.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.480]   Wait, which whole thing?
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.360]   - Me and me and my ability to do this thing.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.840]   - Oh, those kinds of doubts.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.240]   First of all, did you have those kinds of doubts?
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.360]   - No, I had different kind of doubts.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.320]   I came from a very working class background
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.080]   and I was uncomfortable in academia for a long time.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.680]   But they weren't doubts about my ability or my,
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.120]   they were just the discomfort in being in an environment
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.020]   that my family hadn't participated in.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.720]   I knew nothing about as a young person.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.120]   I didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.760]   until I was almost 20 years old.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.920]   - Yeah.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.020]   - So I did have certain kind of doubts,
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.320]   but not about my ability.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.460]   I don't think I was too worried
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.360]   about whether I would succeed or not.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.320]   I never felt this insecurity, am I ever gonna get a job?
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.200]   That had never occurred to me that I wouldn't.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
