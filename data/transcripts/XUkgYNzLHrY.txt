[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620]   If you look at what would be the ideal setting
[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.640]   for somebody to achieve FIRE, right?
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.120]   It would be a married couple, no kids,
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.760]   very high salaries, professional salaries,
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.600]   live in a low cost area and have no student loan debt.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.720]   And somebody who would have a very challenging time
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.920]   would be single, income family, lots of kids,
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.880]   high cost of living area.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.780]   Yeah, I was in a very high paying industry
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.200]   and a very high paying job in finance.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.000]   I had little to no student loan debt.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.840]   We had a single income family,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.180]   so my wife didn't work once we had our daughter.
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.080]   And we lived in a high cost of living area.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.000]   I think even if you are somewhere in between,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.680]   between the ideal and the not so ideal extreme,
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.620]   you can still make it.
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.500]   I mean, I did it.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.800]   And there are lots of people who achieved FIRE
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.880]   without ever earning six figures.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.520]   I understand there are some challenges,
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.680]   but I think also a lot of the criticism,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.060]   it's a little bit of coping, right?
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.900]   It's easier to make excuses than to get your act together and do it.
