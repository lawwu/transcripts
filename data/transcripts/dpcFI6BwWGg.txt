[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the book of Revelation,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   in the fifth chapter, reading verses nine and ten.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   And they sung a new song, saying,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof;
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   and hast made us unto our God kings and priests;
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and we shall reign on the earth.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And again, of course, in the twelfth verse,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   the same theme is repeated in the words,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and wisdom and strength and honor, and glory and blessing.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Now these words that we are looking at are undoubtedly some of the most glorious words
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   that have ever been written.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Some of the most glorious words that are to be found even in the Bible itself.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   This great doxology, this great hymn of praise and of thanksgiving
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   unto our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Nothing, I suggest, has ever exceeded this in glory and in grandeur.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   This is the thing we all remember and realize today that inspired the great Handel
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   to compose what is undoubtedly the greatest of all his choruses,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Worthy is the Lamb.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   But now I always feel that when we are confronted by a great statement like this,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   by a great song in all its glory and majesty,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I feel the danger is that we become so moved by the very words
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and especially by the association of songs and tunes and hymns
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   that we may very well forget the real meaning.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   That is a danger which confronts us when we consider any one of these
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   outstanding passages in holy scriptures.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It is so easy to recite or to sing, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   But it does not always mean that as we do so, that we realize and fully understand
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   what it is that we are saying.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   But fortunately for us, the Apostle John here in writing explains to us
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   why it is that the angelic hosts sing this anthem,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   this great doxology of praise unto the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And therefore if we are truly to sing this and to feel it in our hearts,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   we must listen to and follow the explanation that is given by the Apostle himself.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Now you notice that he says that they sung a new song,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   and that at once gives us the key to the understanding.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It points us to the other song that he has already recorded
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   at the end of the previous chapter, where he tells us that the four and twenty elders
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   and cast their crowns before the throne saying,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   For thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Now that is a song that has always been sung in heaven.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   But here we have a new song.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Why does he call this a new song?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And the answer is here before us quite plainly.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   The first song, the song in chapter four,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   is what we may call the doxology of creation.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   It is a great hymn of praise unto God, the everlasting and eternal creator.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It is the doxology of creation.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   But this new song is the doxology of redemption,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   the doxology of salvation.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Not only that, you notice that the first song is sung only to God the Father.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   It is a hymn of praise to the eternal Father, the creator.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   But here in the new song, in this second doxology,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   our Lord also takes part in the praise,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   and he is coupled with the Father.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   That is why, you see, it ends off by saying,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   "Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and unto the Lamb forever and ever."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And indeed, in this fifth chapter, the emphasis is actually upon the Son,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   upon the Lamb.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He shares the glory of redemption with the Father
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   in a peculiar and exceptional manner.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Now the question before us, therefore, is why does he do so?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Why is he worthy to receive this worship and praise and glory
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and adoration with the Father?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And the answer is, of course, that the Father has handed the whole question
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   of redemption and of salvation over unto his Son.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It is God the Son who, in particular,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   is the center of redemption and of salvation.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And that is why these great angelic hosts, these great spirits,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   these who are represented by the beasts and the elders,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   that is why everything in the whole of creation,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   in heaven and earth and in the sea, in every part of the whole cosmos,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   ascribes this peculiar praise unto him
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and says that he is worthy to be praised even as the Father is praised.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Now why is this?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Well, let us try to answer that question.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   The first answer we have is that he and he alone is the Lord of redemption.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   He and he alone is able to carry out God's plan
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and purpose of redemption fully and completely.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Now this is something we arrive at, of course,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   as we consider this incident of the book.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   John tells us that he and the Spirit saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   in the right hand of God the Father, a book written within and on the backside,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   sealed with seven seals.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And they saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   "Who is worthy to open the book and to unloose the seals thereof?"
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   What is this?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Well, this is the book of redemption.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   This is the book of the history of God's redeemed people
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   and their relationship to the whole world.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   If you like, the book is the book that is unfolded to us
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   in the remainder of this book of Revelation, this Apocalypse,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   the last book in the Bible.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   But it is in particular, I say, the book of the history of redemption.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Now that's what makes these two chapters so interesting.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   You have to read something between the end of chapter 4 and the beginning of chapter 5,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and this is what you read.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Here in chapter 4, the glory of creation is celebrated,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and God is worshipped and adored as the God of creation.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He has made all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And he not only made all things, but he made them perfect.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Having made them all, he looked upon them and he saw that it was all good,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   and he is to be praised for the perfection of his creation.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   But alas, creation is no longer like that.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Something's happened, creation has fallen.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   The world is not as God made it, man is not as God made him.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   The terrible thing described in the early chapters of the book of Genesis took place,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   third chapter in particular, man rebelled against God, sinned, he fell, became himself corrupt,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   the servant and the slave of the devil, lost his original righteousness,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   and the whole cosmos fell with him.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   You remember how we are told that God, as a part of the punishment of sin,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   cursed the very ground,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   and told the men that henceforth he would have to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   that thorns and briers would arise, and that there would be a struggle and a conflict.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The whole of creation has fallen together with men.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And here is men, I say, fallen, corrupt, the slave of sin, the slave of the devil,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   the slave of the world, and subject to death.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Now the great question is, how can all this be restored?
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   How can God's perfect universe be redeemed from the fall and its effects, and men in particular?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Well now, that is what you read between chapters four and five of the book of Revelation.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And John, of course, as a believer and as a Christian, he knows that this has happened.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   He knows that God had a great plan and purpose of redemption.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   But how can it be carried out?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   How can men, how can the cosmos be delivered from the power of the devil and the evil,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   and of hell and of death?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Here is the great question and the great problem.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Who is able to deliver the world, the cosmos, and men in particular?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And it is a terrible problem because we read here that John observed that no man in heaven or in earth,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And then he is suddenly informed by one of the elders who said to him,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And so the story proceeds, and the book is handed to this lamb that had been slain.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And he thereby is proclaimed as the Lord of redemption,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   as the one and only person who is capable of carrying out God's great purpose and plan of salvation.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Now we must start with this point, therefore, and we must emphasize it.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It is he and he alone who is able to redeem.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   There is no man who can save himself or anybody else.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   There is no angel that could do it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   There was no one in heaven or on earth, nor under the earth, nor anywhere else.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   There is but one who can redeem and carry out the purpose of God,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and it is none other than the Son of God himself.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   He alone is strong enough, he alone is great enough.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   He alone is able to do the work that is necessary that this fallen universe be restored
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   to God who originally made it in all its perfection.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So he is the one who is to be praised.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   He is the one to whom the new song is to be sung.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Salvation is in him and in him alone.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   He is the author and the finisher of our faith.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   There is none other name under him given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   In redemption, he and he alone must have the glory.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   There is no one who can even share it with him.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   He is the head of salvation.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   He is the head of the kingdom of God.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   He is the head of all the citizens of the kingdom of God.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Salvation is in his hands.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   He alone was able to start the work.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   He alone can finish the work.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   You see, this is why John wept.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   John knew that he was a saved man, but he was still in the world.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   He still has to fight the world, the flesh, the devil, and all this terrible power.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   How can God's plan be brought to ultimate consummation?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And John here realizes and is given to understand by this vision given to him
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   that the one who started it is also able to finish it.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   So you see, the great theme of the book of the Revelation is the triumph of the Lamb.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   How all the forces that have risen against him and will rise against him are all going to be defeated.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   How governmental powers, how apostate churches,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   how everything that is against God and his Christ is finally going to be routed.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   The Lamb is going to conquer.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   He is the Lord of redemption from the very beginning until the very end.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And he is going to fight until he has finally prevailed.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   It is the Lamb, therefore, the Lamb that was slain,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   and he alone who is worthy to be praised.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   He alone can handle the history.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   He alone can fight the forces inimical to God and to men.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   He alone is strong enough and great enough to finish the work which the Father has given him to do.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Very well then, there I say is our first great principle taught here,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   that the glory must be his and it must be his alone.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   He needs no assistant.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   There is no such thing as a co-redemptor or a co-redemptrix.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   He needs no help even from Mary who bore him in a human sense.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   He needs no help from saints.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   He needs no help from priests.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   He needs no help from church.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   He and he alone has done the work,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   and the glory is and must be his and his alone.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   There is no other in heaven or earth or under the sea or anywhere else.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   He is alone.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And he alone must be praised and worshipped and adored.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Very well, that's the first reason why he is worthy to receive this praise,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   because he is the Lord of redemption.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   But secondly, he is worthy to be praised because of what enabled him to become the Lord of redemption.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And this is put before us in a very wonderful manner.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   How has he become the Lord of redemption?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And the first answer is, of course, because he is who he is.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   He is personal.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Who is he?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   John beheld a lamb as it was slain in the midst of the throne,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   having seven horns and seven eyes,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And the moment he did so, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   having every one of them harps and golden vials full of orders,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   which are the prayers of saints, and they began to sing this new song.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Who is this?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Well, you see, this is the person, the unique person in the whole of history.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   He is clearly God.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Why?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Well, because the same praise is ascribed unto him as unto God himself.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   As I've reminded you in chapter four, that first axology of creation was ascribed unto God.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   He is worthy to receive glory and honor and power, but so is this person.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   There is one who is worthy to be worshipped and to be praised and to be adored,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   even as God himself the Father is.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   So I say that he must be God.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   He worshiped God alone, and if this one is to be worshipped, he must be God.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And he is, he's alive.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   He is full of power.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   He has seven horns, seven the number of perfection.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   He is omnipotent, he is all-powerful.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   He has seven eyes, he is filled with the spirit of God, the spirit of wisdom.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   He is absolute in his perfection.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   The loyal, the omnipotent one, God.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   But you notice that he is also referred to as of the tribe of Judah and the root of David.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   He is also man.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   He is born, he's a descendant of David.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   He belongs to the tribe of Judah.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   He has lived on earth.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   He's been slain, he's been buried in a grave.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   He's God, yes, but he's also man.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And here we are face to face with the central mystery and glory, of course, of the whole teaching of the Bible.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   That redemption is only possible by God's own Son coming into the world,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   taking unto him human nature, being born as a babe of the seed of David according to the flesh,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   but at the same time declared to be the Son of God with power,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   His person.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I don't stop with that this morning, but my dear friends,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   there is no Christianity apart from this great truth concerning the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   He's not only man, he's God.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   He's not only God, he's also man.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   The two natures in one person.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   The loyal of the tribe of Judah, the one with perfection of power and of wisdom,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   and yet the one who humbled himself, even unto the death of the cross.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   The person.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   There is no salvation, I say, in any other.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   No man, no angel, no angelic being, nothing, no one.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   The Son, the eternal Son, is the only one who is capable of working out the plan of salvation and of redemption.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   But you notice the emphasis in this chapter is not even on the person,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   but it is in particular upon the work of the person.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, slaughtered, put to death, redeemed us by his blood.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And this is the great emphasis that is so obvious in this entire chapter.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   What has made the Son of God the captain of salvation, the Lord of redemption,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   is not even the incarnation.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   It isn't even his perfect life.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   It isn't his teaching. It isn't his example.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The thing that makes him Lord of redemption is his death, a lamb as it had been slain.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And this goes on being repeated, the lamb that was slain, the blood.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   In other words, the crucial point in the whole history of redemption
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   was the death of our blessed Lord upon the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Why is he worthy to be praised? The answer is because he's been slain.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And this is something that is taught everywhere in the scriptures.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Take, for example, a parallel in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Philippians
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   where he traces our Lord's humiliation.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Wherefore, because of that, God hath also highly exalted him
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and given him a name that is above every name.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   He is worthy to be praised, not only because he is who he is,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   but in particular because of what he's done,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   because he is a lamb that has been slain,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   because he died, because his blood was shed.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Now this is the crucial doctrine.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   The death of our Lord was not an accident.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   The death of our Lord was not a tragedy.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   It was not something that we should regret.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   It is not something about which we should be mournful
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   and spend our time as so many will be doing today
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   in three hours of misery and of agony and of mourning.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   No, no, it's the most glorious thing in history.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   It is because of this he is worthy to be praised.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It is by means of this that he became the Lord of redemption.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   The cross is the focal point in all his work.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   It is the most glorious point of all.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   It is indeed a wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   He came into the world in order to go there.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   He was made a little lower than the angels,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   as Hebrews 2.9 puts it, for the suffering of death,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   that he by the grace of God might taste death for every man.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   The cross, therefore, must never be thought of as an accident,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   something unfortunate, something we wished had never happened,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   something that never should have happened.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   The cross was determined before the foundation of the world.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   It is the crucial point in God's plan of redemption.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   He becomes the master of redemption because of what he did upon the cross.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   What then is this?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Why do I say that the cross is crucial and is focal?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I can but give you some thoughts to meditate upon today
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and for the rest of your lives.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Here is the first.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   The cross is crucial and focal because it was the highest point in his obedience to his Father.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   He came to do his Father's will,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   and he carried out his Father's will perfectly in every respect.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   The secret of our Lord is his humbling of himself to his Father's will,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   his sacrifice of himself and of his will.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   So Paul says in Philippians 2, "Let this mind be in you," which was also in Christ Jesus,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   "who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   but made himself of more reputation,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and took upon him the form of a servant,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   and was made in the likeness of men,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   and being found in fashion as a man,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   he humbled himself and became obedient unto death,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   even the death of the cross."
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   It is the highest point in his obedience to his Father.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   He submits utterly to the Father's will, and this is the supreme point.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   You remember how in the Garden of Gethsemane
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   he offered that prayer, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass by."
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   He had never questioned, he had never queried his Father's will.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   He had come to do his Father's will, and he had done it.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   But here is something, and for a moment he says, "Is it possible?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Must this happen? Is there no other way?
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done."
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   It is the utter submission.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It is the highest point of his obedience.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   He could not go beyond this.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   He gives even his life.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   He obeys even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   But secondly, as it is the highest point in his obedience,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   it is also the lowest point in his humiliation.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And that is the amazing thing about that passage in Philippians 2.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   You see him equal with God in the glory everlasting,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   sharing all the prerogatives of God, but he leaves it.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   He divests himself of these signs.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   He humbles himself.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   He makes himself of no reputation.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And down and down and down he comes, in the likeness of man,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   and then a servant, and even beyond, down even to the depths,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   the final depths of the scourging and the shame,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   the cantimele, the scorn, the crown of thorns,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   the nails, the agony, the suffering, the thirst.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   And finally, the awful moment of dereliction,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and then the death and the burial and the grave.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   It is, I say, the lowest point of his humiliation.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Everything that he did meant his self-abasement, his humiliation.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Think of him through whom all things were made,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   lying as a helpless babe in a manger.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Think of him who controls everything, subject to men and their buffetings
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and their misunderstandings, working with his own hands, experiencing poverty.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   All these things are a part of his humiliation,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   but there is nothing comparable to this.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   There he dies the death of a felon.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and there he is hanging on a tree.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   It is the lowest point in his humiliation of himself.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   What is its real meaning? What is the central mystery?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Well, it's this.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   It is there he makes the grand atonement.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   It is there that God sets him forth as a propitiation for sins
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   through faith in his blood.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   And that is why in the imagery of this chapter
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   we see him as a lamb that was slain.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   You see, John is told that the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   So he expects to see a roaring lion in all his might and majesty and power.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   But instead, I beheld and lo, in the midst of the throne and the four beasts
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb as it had been slain.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   You see, the power is in this death.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And here he is as a lamb that has been slain.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   What does this mean?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Well, we haven't time to go into it.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   But you see, this is the fulfillment of all the Old Testament prophecies.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   God had prophesied, God had given the knowledge and the information
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   that he was going to send a redeemer, a savior, into the world.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And he prefigures it and foreshadows it with all the ceremonial of the temple,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   the burnt offerings and the sacrifices.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   You remember the teaching.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   You remember the paschal lamb even before that
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   when the children of Israel were delivered from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   The lamb was slain.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   His blood was painted upon the doorpost and the lintel.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   And thereby the children of Israel were passed by while the others were destroyed.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   The paschal lamb.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And the lamb offered morning and evening, every day in the tabernacle and in the temple.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   What does it mean?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Ah, God has already given the teaching.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Sin is a terrible thing in the sight of God.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   The justice of God demands the punishment of sin.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And the wages of sin is death.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And sin is punished by death.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And there is only one way whereby man can be forgiven and redeemed.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And that is that the price of his sin be paid,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   that the sin be punished by death,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   the blood must be shed,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   and then there is salvation and forgiveness possible.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   And the Old Testament says that that is the only way.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   All the lambs that were slain throughout the running centuries
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   were just pointing forward to the lamb that was to come.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Their types, their shadows, their illustrations, their adumbrations.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And so when Isaiah is given the vision, the understanding,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   the revelation of how it is going to happen,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   he sees the Messiah and he sees him as a lamb led to the slaughter.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   He sees him bruised, smitten, stricken of God,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   a lamb, as it were, slain.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Then John the Baptist, the great forerunner of the Savior, the Redeemer,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   he points to him and says, "Behold, the Lamb of God
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   The blood of bulls and of goats, the blood of lambs is not sufficient.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   It covers our sin, but it is prophetic only.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   And here is the fulfillment.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   "He's come," says John, "God's Lamb."
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Here is God's sacrifice, the Lamb.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   "Great God, the Son, yes, but humbled, born as a babe, living as a man,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   here he is, Lamb of God.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   We beheld him stricken, smitten of God.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   This is the center. This isn't an accident.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   This is the thing prepared before the foundation of the world.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   God tells it's coming. At last he's come, the Lamb of God,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   the sin bearer, the one who receives the punishment
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   of the guilt of your sins and mine.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   So the cross is not an accident.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   It is because he is the Lamb that was slain
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   that he is worthy to receive the honor.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   It is this that makes him the Lord of salvation
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   and the Lord of history and the controller of all events.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   He's purchased the right by dying upon the cross.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And that leads me to my last point, which is this.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   He is worthy to receive this praise and honor and glory
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   because of the consequences of his work.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And here they are put before us in such a wonderful manner.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   He came, says John in his first epistle, chapter 3, verse 8,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   to destroy, to undo the works of the devil.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   That's why the Son of God ever came into this world,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   to remove the consequences of the fall.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And he did that supremely by his death upon the cross.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   What has he done? Well, listen to the answer.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   for thou were slain and hast bought us,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   hast redeemed us to God by thy blood,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   The whole world was in Adam, and the whole world fell in Adam,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   and the whole world is guilty in Adam.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   The whole world is in sin.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Every man, everywhere, every nation and kindred and tribe and tongue,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   all are lost and condemned.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   But here is one who is able to be the Savior of the world.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And he is saved by his blood.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   He has bought, he has purchased, he has redeemed us by his blood.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   What has he bought for us?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   This is the glory of Good Friday.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   He has bought for us pardon and forgiveness.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   We are all sinners in the sight of God, and we are all guilty,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   and the wrath of God is upon us all by nature.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   We are all the children of wrath by nature, even as others,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   says Paul in Ephesians 2, 3.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   We all need to be pardoned and to be forgiven.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   How can we be forgiven? There is only one answer.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   It is because he has been punished for us.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   He has bought forgiveness for us by his blood.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   He has purchased our reconciliation unto God
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   by becoming the lamb that was slain.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   He made his soul an offering for sin.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   By his stripes we are healed.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   So he has bought for us pardon and forgiveness,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   but more than that, he has bought for us the right to be the people of God.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Listen to the way it is put in the psalm.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   and hast made us unto our God kings and priests.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   This is very wonderful.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   God's original men, Adam, he fell, and all his posterities form.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   That's God's people, fallen, guilty, condemned.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And the plan of redemption is a plan to form a new people of God,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   and a new kingdom which shall be perfect and whole and entire,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   filled with citizens like unto Adam before his fall, and even more wonderful.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And Christ, by his blood and by his death,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   has purchased for us the right to be the children of God.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   He has purchased unto God a people, a kingdom, a priesthood.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And you and I, according to the words of the apostle Peter,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   are in this condition, who were not a people, but are now the people of God,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   who have not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   He's purchased a people for God by his blood,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   and all who believe in him belong to this, and we belong to his kingdom.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And we shall reign, we are told, on the earth.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   He has purchased for us freedom from the law.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   We are dead indeed unto the law, we are dead to sin, we are dead to the devil,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   we are no longer under the dominion of Satan,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   we have been taken out of his kingdom, translated into the kingdom of God's dear Son,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   we are no longer slaves of the world, slaves of evil, slaves of death, slaves of hell.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Whosoever liveth and believeth in him shall not die.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   He has purchased for us not only the privilege of being the people of God,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   but he has purchased for us freedom as the people of God.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   If the Son shall set you free, you shall be free indeed.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   We are in a new kingdom, citizens of the kingdom of God, people of God,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   and priests able to worship, having immediate access, even into the holiest of all, by the blood of Jesus.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   I need no priest, I need no intercessor,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   I have access even into the holiest of all, by the blood of Jesus.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   There is only one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   He has purchased all that for us.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   And above and beyond all that, he has purchased for us a glory which is to come.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   And they shall reign on the earth.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Not only forgiveness, not only rebirth, not only relationship to God, not only liberty,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   but ultimate glorification.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   We shall reign with him, we shall judge the world, we shall judge angels,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   we shall share with him in his glorious reign.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   They shall reign on or over the earth.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Thus, you see, he has purchased all this for us.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   And indeed, beyond that, he has purchased something for the whole universe.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   For there is going to be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   There is a great regeneration coming when everything that has fallen with men shall again be restored.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Listen to the Apostle Paul putting it in Romans 8, in a glorious passage,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   where he again has a preview of this tremendous thing that is coming.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature of creation
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   For the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   And all that has been purchased by the death of our Lord on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   It is there he did this work.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   He has bought, he has purchased, he has redeemed all men and the universe
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   that fell as the consequence of the fall of men.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   For that the very cosmos shall be renewed and shall be glorified.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Worthy is the Lamb that was slain.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Why? Well, because he has carried out God's plan and purpose of redemption perfectly.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   And he will carry it out until it is finally completed.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Let any evil power arise, it will make no difference.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Don't be frightened of your communism or your materialism or any otherism.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Let all the powers of hell arise.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Let beasts come out of the land, out of the sea.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Let them come from everywhere.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   The Lamb shall triumph and prevail.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   He is the Lord of redemption.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   He is the Lord of history.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   All power, he says, has been given unto me.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Why? To him, because he died.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   It is because he is the Lamb that was slain and his blood has been shed.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   He has purchased the right.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   He has bought a people.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   He has a kingdom.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   He will triumph and prevail.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   His kingdom will rule over all.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Say well then, my friends, hear of these angelic beings.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   They see it all.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Don't cry, they say to John.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Don't weep. Don't be fearful.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   It's all right.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   The Lamb of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   The Lamb that was slain has triumphed.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   He has done the deed.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   All that was necessary.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Every enemy has been defeated.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   On the cross he was putting the principalities and powers to an open shame.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Triumphing over them in it and by it.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And thus he opens the gate of heaven and introduces the promise of everlasting glory.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Well, there they are.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   The four beasts and the twenty-four elders singing ever.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to have power and riches and honor.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Worthy is the Lamb.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Blessing and honor, glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   That's their song.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Is it your song?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Are you giving all the praise and the honor and the glory to the Son of God?
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   And especially because he died on Calvary's cross.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Do you know that you have been redeemed by his precious blood?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Do you know that he died that you might be forgiven?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Do you know that he stood in your way?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
