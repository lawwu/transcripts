[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Brad from Mount Gilead, Ohio, who must be a Bible teacher or pastor because he asks this,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   "Pastor John, can you in your personal devotions check the impulse to want to think about how to teach what you're discovering in Scripture
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   in order to simply enjoy it personally and devotionally?"
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   What would you say to Brad?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I really enjoy thinking about this question.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   The first flag I want to wave is a flag that celebrates the inseparable nature of seeing glory and saying what we've seen.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   In other words, I'm not sure that we should fret too much about the impulse of turning our seeing into saying.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I wrote a whole book about this a year or two ago, so it's really important to me.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I've thought a lot about it, and I'm eager to dive into this with Brad.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I've tasted the dangers and the glories of what Brad is talking about.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So we're reading the Bible. We see something new and fresh and amazing.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   We experience a flash of genuine enjoyment of what it shows us about God.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And then there's an almost immediate impulse to begin shaping it for a conversation or an email or a devotional thought or a sermon
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   or a lecture or a blog post or a poem or a tweet.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I mean, this is real dangerous stuff.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And it can feel in that moment as though we have lost the authenticity of our enjoyment of communing with God in the truth we have seen.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   That is a real danger that Brad's put his finger on.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I don't want to minimize it.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I want to agree the danger is there.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   In fact, I think the danger, at least in my experience, is first that the impulse to plan to teach or restate in some way what I've seen
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   may reveal that my enjoyment is not really in the Lord himself at that moment,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   but rather in the intellectual process of making the discovery
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and in the impulseâ€”I mean, if that impulse to go on and teach that reveals that to me, reveals that insidious deception,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   to me it has served me well.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And I want to be on my face in repentance pleading with the Lord to deliver me from the bondage to that kind of intellectualism
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   that finds more pleasure in the processes of intellectual discovery in the Bible than the glorious one we've discovered.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So that's the first aspect of the danger as I've experienced it and I think Brad is describing.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   The second part of the danger is that the impulse to turn my insights into, say, a teaching plan or a blog or something
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   may signal that I crave recognition from an audience for what I've seen.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So my pleasure is not so much in what I've seen as in the approval others are going to give me for seeing it.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   How horribly insidious and dangerous this is.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   If my impulse to teach reveals that to me, again, I'm on my face, I'm pleading, "Oh God, deliver me from that kind of vain glory."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So Brad is right to be concerned about this and I think there are steps we can take to minimize those dangers
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and maximize the benefits and I'll mention those in just a minute.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   What I've discovered over the years is that I am helped to see more of God and more of his ways in the Word
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   precisely by the impulse to turn seeing into saying.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So this is the positive side now.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's not just dangers that come from this impulse.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   There are positive things.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's precisely the effort to find words, effective, compelling, awakening words,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   which bring greater clarity, greater depth to the first flash of insight.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So that's the first positive thing.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Now I suspect the reason God set it up that way relates to the second positive dimension of this impulse,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   namely that by its nature, by its very nature, the enjoyment of God himself and all his ways is essentially centrifugal.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   In other words, as our minds circle, orbit around some glorious sight, discovery about God and his Word,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   viewing it with joy from all the angles as we orbit the thing we've seen,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   the very circling of the mind to see the beauty of the truth tends to fling the mind outward where people are
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   so that they can be drawn into this orbit of seeing.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I think that belongs to the very nature of the truth of God, the very nature of God.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   He is not a privatistic God.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   He is a very public God.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   He is a displaying God, a communicating God, an expansive God.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So it's not surprising to me that not only would our seeing become centrifugal almost immediately,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   but that he would design for that centrifugal impulse that it would be a way of seeing more.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   That seems exactly the way God would be.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And the third positive thing I would say about this impulse that Brad feels to teach something that he's seen almost immediately when he's seen it and enjoyed it,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   the third thing is that the teaching or the writing is not a separate thing from the enjoyment of what we have seen,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   but is the overflow of it.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   It's the extension or the expansion of the enjoyment.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So teaching, at least this is what it ought to be, I think, teaching is not strictly a mere second step after enjoyment,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   but is an extension of the enjoyment itself.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Otherwise, I think teaching becomes inauthentic.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And that can be a danger almost as great as the original inauthenticity of the enjoyment,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   that that would be if we only had the enjoyment in order to teach it.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So it cuts both ways.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   For teaching to be authentic, it must be an extension of that joy, I think.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Otherwise, it's just not Christian teaching of glorious truth.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And the last thing, maybe the fourth thing, I've lost count, the fourth observation that's positive about this impulse is that to aim at the building of faith,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   to aim at the refining of holiness, to aim at the empowering of mission in the lives of those we teach,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   those aims are organically, inseparably, essentially related to the expansion and extension of the enjoyment of God that we have experienced.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   This very enjoyment is what we want to happen in the world.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   More and more and more people coming to see and savor the glory of God's grace.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   That's what faith is.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's what holiness is.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   That's what the mission is about.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   So I'll end here.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   The steps that I think Brad should take to minimize the dangers, maximize the benefits, is first, and he's already doing this,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   test your heart to see if you are enjoying God authentically and supremely,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   or if you're enjoying the process of discovering things about God more than you're enjoying God himself.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   So do a self-check there.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Number two, and this is the most practical thing I have found,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   pause repeatedly when meditating on the scriptures and actually tell God how much you are enjoying what you have seen.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Tell him. Tell him.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Talk to him about how good he is and beautiful he is and wise he is and just he is.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Build into your meditation a time, for example, to sing to him.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I find this to be a great test of my soul.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Am I in such a hurry to finish my reading, get on with saying it somewhere,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   or to read more, to get more insight, that I find it to be annoying to pause and sing to God about his goodness?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Or am I ready to pause, ready to soak, ready to say to God?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I find that to be a barometer of the temperature of my authenticity that really works better than any other barometer.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And the third thing, practically, I'd say to Brad is when the mind is drawn out by the impulse to teach or speak or write or whatever,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   say what you have seen.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Make sure that you view this not merely as a way of saying but as a way of seeing more of God by saying
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   and make sure that all you're teaching is the overflow, the authentic overflow of your enjoyment.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Boy, those are really beautiful implications we all need.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And alluded to earlier in the episode is John Piper's book, "Seeing Beauty and Saying Beautifully,"
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   a book you can download for free at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Well, tomorrow we have another great question.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   This one comes from a podcast listener who notices all the promises in the Psalms that are given to the righteous.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   So who qualifies in God's book to be the righteous, and how can we qualify?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   John Piper is back tomorrow to explain.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Don't miss this episode.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
