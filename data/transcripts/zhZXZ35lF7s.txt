[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.820]   - What are your thoughts on the efforts of the new folks,
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.820]   SpaceX and Elon Musk?
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.820]   What are your thoughts about what Elon is doing?
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.580]   Do you see him as competition?
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.140]   Do you enjoy competition?
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.180]   What are your thoughts?
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.060]   - Yeah, first of all, certainly Elon, I'd say SpaceX
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.140]   and some of his other ventures
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.140]   are definitely a competitive force in the space industry.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.820]   And do we like competition?
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.420]   Yeah, we do.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.460]   And we think we're very strong competitors.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.220]   I think it's, you know,
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.020]   competition is what the US is founded on in a lot of ways
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.580]   and always coming up with a better way.
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.060]   And I think it's really important to continue,
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.900]   you know, to have fresh eyes coming in, new innovation.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.420]   I do think it's important to have level playing fields.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.020]   And so you wanna make sure
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.140]   that you're not giving different requirements
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.740]   to different players.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.460]   But, you know, I tell people, you know,
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.460]   I spent a lot of time at places like MIT.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.520]   I'm gonna be at the MIT Beaverworks Summer Institute
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.020]   over the weekend here.
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.980]   And I tell people, this is the most exciting time
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.340]   to be in the space business in my entire life.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.900]   And it is this explosion of new capabilities
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.940]   that have been driven by things like the, you know,
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.780]   the massive increase in computing power,
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.980]   things like the massive increase in comms capabilities,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.060]   advanced and additive manufacturing
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.420]   are really bringing down the barriers to entry in this field
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.820]   and it's driving just incredible innovation.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.960]   It's happening at startups,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.480]   but it's also happening at Lockheed Martin.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.280]   I talked about some of these like, you know,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.460]   Maya and Orion, but, you know,
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.540]   we're in the middle of what we call smartsats
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.180]   and software-defined satellites
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.960]   that can essentially restructure and remap their purpose,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.380]   their mission on orbit to give you almost, you know,
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.900]   unlimited flexibility for these satellites
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.380]   over their lifetimes.
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.600]   So those are just a couple of examples,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.760]   but yeah, this is a great time to be in space.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
