[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.540]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.320]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.880]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.620]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.080]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.080]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.480]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.440]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.600]   this homeschooling possibility,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.680]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.000]   I believe you will enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.240]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.640]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.260]   you will find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.680]   So, go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.480]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.280]   All right, welcome listeners.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.460]   I'm so excited to be here with you today.
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.480]   To talk about the finer things in life.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.600]   And by that, I mean protocol.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.600]   We are getting into the middle of our second semester.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.960]   Many of our challenge classes
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.780]   are on the cusp of big projects.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.900]   We've got challenge beers working on mock trial.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.900]   We have students writing short stories and doing debates.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.220]   And our challenge two classes
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.540]   are turning their eyes toward protocol.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.920]   And so today, we wanna talk a little bit
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.460]   about what is protocol?
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.740]   Maybe, what is it not?
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.380]   How can we as parents and directors and tutors
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.000]   help our students enjoy protocol?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.940]   And I have just the person who's gonna help us out
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.680]   with some thoughts and some ideas.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.940]   Deb Switzer is here today.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.460]   Deb, thank you so much for coming.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.420]   - Thanks for having me, I'm excited.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.780]   - Well, Deb is one of our academic advisors.
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780]   And so she provides a lot of support
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.640]   for directors of challenges two, three, and four
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.600]   all over the world.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.300]   And so Deb has probably heard
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.100]   every question there is about protocol.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.980]   And so we're gonna see how many of your questions
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.380]   we can anticipate and answer today.
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.100]   So Deb, I wanna start out at the very beginning.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.220]   I remember when we joined CC years and years ago,
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.300]   I had little kids.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.580]   So I had a seven-year-old and a 10-year-old
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.140]   and protocol was not even a twinkle in my eye then.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.180]   In fact, I remember seeing a book
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.980]   in the CC bookstore called Protocol Matters.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.640]   And the only thing I knew about protocol
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.820]   was from my years in college,
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.580]   as a political science major,
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.460]   I knew all about diplomatic protocols and legal protocols.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.100]   And I thought, what in the world can this be?
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.820]   So let's start there at the very beginning.
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.820]   In CC world, what does protocol mean?
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.460]   - Right, so protocol's really just a formal event
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.660]   that's celebrating the Western cultural arts.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.300]   And so it's a time for students to get involved
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.620]   with culture and practice culture,
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.700]   fine dining and the arts.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.300]   It's a formal dinner and a cultural event
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.460]   that the challenge community can celebrate together
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.940]   and just practice.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.020]   We can be in the mission field,
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.100]   but we also might be before Kings one day.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.840]   And so to be able to know how to act
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.940]   and practice that self-control and that etiquette
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.340]   is a beautiful gift that we offer to our students
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.220]   in the challenge program.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.980]   - You know what, that was the best,
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.260]   most succinct explanation of protocol I have ever heard.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.460]   I'm glad we got it on a recording.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.300]   I really appreciated what you said
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.300]   about encouraging our students to understand
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.220]   the cultural arts, the Western cultural arts,
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.500]   what has been important historically
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.260]   in how do we conduct ourselves at cultural events?
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.820]   How do we conduct ourselves in fine dining
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.900]   so that we know what would be expected of us
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.460]   in any situation?
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.460]   You know, we wanna be good ambassadors for Christ
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.540]   wherever we go.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.700]   And sometimes knowing the right thing to do
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.700]   and how to do it and what to say and when to speak
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.260]   and when not to speak is really important
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.260]   and can open doors for us as witnesses wherever we go.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.540]   So I really appreciate that.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.980]   And I love it that you said,
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.580]   I mean, you used some of those words, manners and etiquette
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.580]   and you know, as parents, we do want to teach our children.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.700]   We want to pass on the how to act,
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.100]   how to treat other people.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.740]   I heard one time somebody say that protocol
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.140]   is about learning how to love your neighbor well,
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.060]   whoever your neighbor is and wherever you might meet them
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.660]   and whatever you might be doing.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.540]   And I thought, you know, that's really true.
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.540]   And I remember my husband talking about
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.660]   when he went to his prom,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.220]   I guess as like a junior or senior in high school
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.020]   and his family had not done a lot of fine dining.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.020]   And so he shows up with some of his buddies
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.860]   and all their dates to a fancy restaurant.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.020]   The girls are dressed in long dresses
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.300]   and they are all trying to act, you know,
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.540]   old and super sophisticated.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.220]   He had never been to a restaurant
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.260]   where they bring your bill to the table
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.500]   and then take your payment.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.860]   And he said, so he was mortified.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.140]   They all were mortified
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.700]   when they went traipsing around the restaurant
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.100]   trying to find the kiosk to pay.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.060]   And he was mortified because he said,
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.220]   my parents didn't tell me that I might face a situation
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.900]   where you pay at the table.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.100]   And so at that point, I thought, you know,
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.740]   I want my girls as they grow up
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.780]   to know how to act in every situation
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.860]   just so they're not embarrassed.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.780]   And so that's a great reason to do protocol.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.620]   - It is.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.820]   And it's such a, again, it's a gift to our,
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.220]   it's a gift to our kids, right?
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.340]   So how many funny movies are there out there
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.700]   where like they look at the table setting
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.740]   and they don't know which fork to use.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.020]   Everybody's mortified.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.140]   But instead of that being a fear
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.740]   to give them the ability to practice this,
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.260]   'cause, you know, let's face it, as homeschool moms,
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.620]   I'm not laying out a formal dinner for my kids every week
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.020]   and having them practice what fork to use,
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.140]   or we may not be sitting down
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.500]   and listening to classical music every evening,
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.940]   although I would love to do that.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.860]   I don't think that that doesn't actually happen.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.940]   We traipse off to a basketball game.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.220]   And so this is really an amazing opportunity
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.740]   for them to celebrate the culture
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.820]   and the arts and fine dining
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.980]   and to not have it be the unknown
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.780]   or to have it be an awkward moment.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.820]   They can really engage and learn together
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.100]   and they get to learn with their friends,
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.940]   which is much better.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.740]   - Which is always more fun.
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.580]   That's right.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.420]   They love that part.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.300]   And I really like that for a lot of our families,
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.620]   it is a great way to introduce your student
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.180]   and their friends to past times
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.900]   that they may not get a lot of.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.460]   Most of us maybe don't go to the symphony very often
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.420]   or don't go to an opera, maybe ever.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.300]   And so it is an introduction
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.220]   both to something you're unfamiliar with,
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.380]   but also it can be an introduction
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.380]   to something that your student might find a passion for.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.900]   That's a great thing.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.740]   - Right.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.900]   There's so many of our talent students
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.980]   who love the arts, right?
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.260]   They do dance or they do theater.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.420]   They play in an orchestra.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.060]   And so there's so many opportunities to share that love
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.300]   and that passion with your fellow students in class
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.900]   and be like, hey, we actually, I do this.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.340]   This is something that I love to do.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.900]   And you can share that love with your friends,
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.180]   which is a great thing to do as well.
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.180]   - I love it that it is a community event
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.620]   and that you don't do it just with your family.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.540]   I mean, you do it with other people your age
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.620]   who maybe know as much or as little as you do
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.180]   about some of these things.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.980]   So we've probably touched on a lot
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.580]   of the way you will answer this question,
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.740]   but I wanna ask it right out for you.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.740]   Why does Classical Conversations think that protocol
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.020]   is worthy of attention from teenagers and families
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.900]   and communities?
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.900]   Because let's face it, we're homeschoolers.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.140]   We're all busy.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.940]   We're all stretched thin.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.060]   Many of us are living on one income.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.300]   So we don't have lots of extra money to throw around.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:22.300]   And yet, and yet, this seems to be really important.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.380]   Why does CeCe think protocol is so important?
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.740]   - Well, if we think about
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.660]   what classical education really is
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.420]   and that we are developing the whole human being, right?
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.500]   We are trying to see what makes us more human.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.780]   We don't wanna eliminate the arts and culture
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.460]   because of a cost reason
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.540]   or just because that can be put to the side.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.380]   That's not what we,
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.100]   we really wanna develop the whole human being
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.980]   just like we look at language,
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.460]   just like we're looking at math,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.580]   whatever it is that we're looking at.
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.900]   Classical Conversations is not trying to develop
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.860]   just portions or fragments of a student's education.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.820]   We're trying to develop the whole human experience.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.660]   And so this is just one portion of that,
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.100]   but it's an important portion.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.620]   And it's a portion that can become a milestone memory
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.220]   for the students as well.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.780]   And so we wanna develop that entire human being,
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.620]   including the cultural arts
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.660]   and knowing that those are important.
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.340]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.940]   I love that so much that protocol,
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.460]   we need to change the way we're thinking about it.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.460]   I know that for a lot of families in our community,
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:37.220]   when my girls were in challenge, protocol was extra.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.540]   And some people thought of it
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.700]   as an extra drain on their time.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.700]   And some people thought of it as an extra expense,
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.220]   but it was definitely in their minds extra.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.820]   And so that meant it's in addition to,
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.420]   it's just outside of what we're teaching our children,
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.740]   but I love what you said.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:03.740]   It is part of teaching our students to be fully human,
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:09.260]   to fully embrace all of the parts of what a beauty
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:15.420]   and truth and goodness that God has made us able
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.540]   to apprehend.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.900]   And so the appreciation of beauty and in sound
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.980]   and in movement is really important.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.580]   And so I love that.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.220]   And I also love the whole perspective.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.340]   I think I said that somebody else taught me
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.420]   that protocol and learning good manners
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.100]   is a way to love your neighbor better.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.900]   It's a way to learn how to treat people with grace
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.300]   and kindness and dignity and importance.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.300]   And so young men, when you learn to pull out the chair
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.620]   of the lady seated next to you,
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.860]   it does not mean you think she is incapable
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.220]   of pulling out her own chair, okay?
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.740]   It is showing that you are caring for your dinner companion
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.260]   and that you are trying to help her have a happy experience.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.980]   And young lady, when you talk to people on your left
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.940]   and on your right, you are doing your part
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.380]   to make sure everyone feels included in the conversation.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.980]   It really is a way to love your neighbor best.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.780]   - Yeah, it's a way to love your neighbor.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.340]   It's also a way to understand
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.140]   just a sense of dignity in our humanity.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.420]   I think sometimes, especially as teenagers,
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.700]   I think we can get super casual with our friends.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.980]   We can get super casual with our families
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.140]   and we can get super casual with ourselves as well.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.660]   And to take a moment to say,
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.100]   hey, I am created in the image of God
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.260]   and I can, and all those things obviously
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.740]   can still be in the image of God,
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.700]   but more of, I can practice this self-control.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.740]   I can enjoy this moment.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.500]   I can elevate my conversation.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.180]   And those moments help us understand
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.500]   just a sense of dignity that we have
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.020]   in being created by God.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.260]   And I love that part of protocol as well.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260]   - I do too.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.740]   This is making me wish that maybe I'll go volunteer
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.900]   to be a chaperone at Protocol 'cause I miss it.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.780]   I miss it, that elevated.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.540]   - Everybody's always looking for volunteers.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.940]   - I know, everybody's always looking for volunteers.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.780]   You're right.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.660]   But that elevated behavior, that gracious living.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.140]   And you know what?
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.620]   When you are in a different environment
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.060]   and when your students are in a more formal environment,
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:46.060]   I think it does cause them to pause and reflect
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.020]   and think more carefully about their conversation
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.420]   and about their behavior
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.500]   and reflect on the finer things in life.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.620]   That's really good.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.900]   - And it also kind of, I'm sorry,
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.100]   just it helps them recognize the difference
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.700]   between pop culture and Western cultural emphasis.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.580]   You know, there's such an emphasis on pop culture,
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.740]   which is widespread.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.100]   It's all over media.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.140]   It's all over the internet.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.540]   It's what we engage in almost on a daily basis, right?
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.580]   We're engaging in pop culture, which is a very familiar,
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.660]   but to step back and say,
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.260]   let's engage in a different type of culture,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.660]   the truth, beauty, and goodness of the Western culture.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.980]   I think that's a beautiful moment
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.180]   for the students as well.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.140]   And to note the difference between the two.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.580]   - Yes, yes.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.500]   We teach them to compare things.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.860]   This is a great way, Deb, you're right.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.660]   It's a great way to compare the culture
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.500]   that they participate in without thinking every day.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.740]   And a culture that perhaps calls them
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.380]   to consider before acting or speaking
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.780]   and to temper even their thoughts
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.620]   through the lens of the search
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.380]   for truth, beauty, and goodness.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.340]   That's really, really good.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.740]   I also think there are some very much tangible skills
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.300]   that our students gain from participating in protocol.
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.300]   I mean, you do understand what fine dining calls for.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:27.020]   You may, your student may grow up
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:32.020]   and go to a scholarship interview or a job interview
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.140]   or be called upon to attend a banquet
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.540]   as a newly hired worker.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.100]   And you want them to have the skills of gracious living
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.260]   such that they can comport themselves
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.340]   without awkwardness and with ease
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.460]   and actually enjoy the experience.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.580]   So that they know, like you said,
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.300]   which fork to use and which course is coming first
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.180]   and what to do with your napkin
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.300]   and how to talk, how to have polite conversation
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.620]   with people you don't know well.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.500]   - Yes, and how to dress for different occasions.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.340]   - Yeah.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.820]   - So it's interesting.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.380]   You even mentioned the college interview,
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.020]   but when we do a protocol event,
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.140]   we ask students to dress up, right?
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.540]   And depending on the event,
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.940]   it might be a different kind of dress,
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.100]   but that same thing happens.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.860]   I remember my daughter thought
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.500]   that jeans were appropriate for an interview.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.420]   - Right.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.740]   - With a nice shirt and jeans.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.140]   And I was like, well, actually,
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.500]   we need to know that we have to elevate our dress
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.420]   just like we might be elevating our dining experience
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.740]   or elevating our conversation.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.380]   And so I think it's important for students
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.140]   to know what type of dress is appropriate.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.980]   - Yes.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.580]   - That's an important skill to learn.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.420]   - Yes.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.820]   - And how do we know that skill, so.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.820]   - Yes, and it's actually really great
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.380]   to practice walking in higher heels
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.460]   or how to sit down when you have on a dress
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.700]   instead of jeans. - Yes, right.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.820]   - For young men, how to tie a tie
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.380]   or what do you do with your suit coat during dinner?
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.220]   Do you keep it on?
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.540]   Do you take it out?
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.220]   Oft, if you're wearing a hat,
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.300]   is it appropriate to wear it inside?
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.500]   All of these things give our students a reason
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.900]   to practice things that might not be familiar,
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.260]   but you don't want them to be utterly unknown
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.100]   to your student.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.740]   And you brought out the best point,
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.500]   'cause yes, I get it.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.180]   We can all, as parents, teach those skills
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.220]   and those attitudes to our children at home,
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.300]   but our children are much more open to learning it
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.980]   and happier to learn it if their friends are along.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.300]   - Yes, it's now they want to do it, right?
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.140]   - Yes.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:55.980]   - Whereas before it might be like,
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.340]   oh, mom's making me do it.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.340]   - Right, it's like, oh, you have to use the fancy dishes.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.020]   - Yes.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.860]   - But it's fun.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.180]   - With your friends, yeah.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.180]   And who doesn't want to do something like that
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.020]   with their friends?
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:08.860]   - Yeah.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.020]   And even the students, I will tell you this,
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.980]   even the students that complain most loudly,
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:21.020]   secretly enjoy what it's like to get dressed up
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.740]   and go somewhere special.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.100]   - They do.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.180]   And it's, you know, I mean, for some,
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.820]   it's definitely a stretch.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.460]   They're out of their comfort zone.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.020]   And honestly, that's another skill
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.100]   that is excellent for our students to be learning as well.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.500]   When we are put in that position where it's not comfortable,
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.060]   where we have to stretch our minds
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.700]   and what we would normally do,
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.700]   but instead we jump in and be part and participate.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.940]   This is something that helps them
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.180]   just build inner strength as well,
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.660]   to be able to be in situations that aren't comfortable
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.140]   and to learn how to thrive and to interact
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.540]   and to make others feel comfortable as well
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.780]   is a beautiful skill.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.220]   - It is a beautiful skill.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.180]   And one that as parents or even directors,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.660]   we might not think of right away,
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.340]   but it is a skill that pays dividends
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.180]   for years and years and years.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.700]   How to become comfortable in situations
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.220]   that call you outside of yourself
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.940]   and outside of your comfort zone.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.340]   That's really good.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.620]   So, okay.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.740]   So now we're all convinced
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.140]   that protocol is a wonderful thing.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.980]   Who is it for?
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.900]   We have all these listeners who are now thinking,
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.980]   my child's gonna do protocol.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.420]   Is it for everybody?
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.020]   Talk to us about that.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.860]   - Sure.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.580]   So Challenge 2 is the planner
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.900]   or the leader of the protocol event.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.260]   And so it is a Challenge 2 event.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.700]   It's their capstone event
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:58.460]   because it culminates all of the Western cultural history
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.420]   that they've been studying.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.780]   All the art and all of the music.
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.540]   And so it's a great final moment
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.260]   for the Challenge 2 community.
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.460]   That being said,
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.700]   they may include those other challenge classes,
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.300]   Challenge 1, Challenge 3, Challenge 4, if they like,
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.300]   and have them participate with them,
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.740]   but it's led and started and planned
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.100]   by the Challenge 2 community
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.460]   to emphasize those conversations.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.300]   - I like that.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.220]   I think that it is a beautiful integration
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.380]   of all of the things that they've been studying.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.020]   The skills that they have been working on
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.140]   up to this point
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.580]   of their roughly sophomore year of high school.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.660]   And then like you said,
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.140]   it's the music that they've been studying
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.700]   and the art that they have been studying.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.300]   The things that they have been exposed to
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.500]   has already given them a taste
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.180]   for Western cultural pursuits.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.020]   And so protocol is just a way to celebrate that.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.340]   And that's why you're right.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.540]   That's why it's the capstone for Challenge 2.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.540]   So I know that there are lots of communities
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.780]   that have been chagrined.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.780]   They heard, "Oh, protocols now, it's just for Challenge 2."
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:22.460]   We want the Challenge 2 classes,
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.820]   the parents, directors, and students
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.820]   to be the linchpins of that.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.340]   But we want others, because, okay,
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.620]   if you only have three people in your Challenge 2 class,
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.740]   it might not be as much fun
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.300]   to go out to a fancy dinner or a play
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.420]   with just two other people and a couple of chaperones.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.740]   And so if you wanted to invite other one,
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.580]   three, and four students and tutors,
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.460]   and maybe parents to go with you,
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.500]   that gives you a bigger group.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.260]   And a lot of times a bigger group is a fun group.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.780]   So yeah, other people, other challenges are open.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.900]   I mean, you can open that up.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.820]   - Sure, and I think every community is unique.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.340]   And I think that Classical Conversations appreciates that
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.900]   and promotes that.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.620]   And so there will be, for some communities,
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.060]   having it be just a Challenge 2 event on its own
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.180]   helps budget, it helps being able to plan a smaller event,
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.180]   and that works great.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.300]   And for some communities,
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.860]   the Challenge 2 community could plan the event
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.220]   and invite other Challenge students to go with them,
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.940]   and that works for their community.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.420]   And I think that's what we want.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.260]   We wanna see communities thriving
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.540]   and doing this event in a way that works for them.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.500]   We just really wanna ensure as well, though,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.020]   that we're getting that, it's the purpose of it.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.180]   The original intent was to celebrate
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.540]   those cultural events, right?
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.380]   To talk about culture.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.300]   I just had a funny conversation with my students
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.780]   'cause we're in the midst of planning it.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.260]   And I said, "Hey guys, I just want you to know
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.060]   "that this is about the cultural event
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.140]   "that you're going to be going to.
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:10.140]   "So I expect you guys to engage your peers about the arts.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.740]   "I expect you to lead the way.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.020]   "I expect you to try to have conversation
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.220]   "about what we're viewing and what we're attending
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.460]   "so that it's, you're the lead
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.620]   "'cause you're to practice the skills
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.460]   "and the things that we've been learning."
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.380]   And so they're like, "Oh, okay."
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.860]   They're like, "Hmm."
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.500]   I was like, "Yeah, so instead of Marvel,
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.500]   "I want you to talk about the theater."
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.620]   - Yes, stretch yourself, stretch yourself.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.820]   That's exactly right.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.660]   Move outside of your comfort zone.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.060]   Just like you said a few minutes ago, stretch yourself.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.500]   You can do this.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.180]   And students who begin practicing,
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.500]   learning how to do it and practicing it
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.260]   when they're still in high school
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.980]   have a easier time as adults.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.540]   And it seems more natural to them.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.740]   I've watched that happen for years and years.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.060]   My own daughters have graduated already
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.500]   and have graduated college.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.980]   And I've tutored lots of kids through the years.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.100]   And I see how this early training
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.980]   in a culture that's not everyday culture
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.380]   has helped put some polish on them
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.620]   and given them some comfort with things that are graceful.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.460]   So, okay.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.580]   So what are the elements of protocol?
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.780]   You and I have been talking about symphonies
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.780]   and plays and operas and going to see maybe museums
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.580]   with great works of art and fine dining.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.620]   What are the elements of protocol?
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.260]   If I'm a challenge to director
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.540]   and I'm just hearing us talk about it now,
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.860]   what is it that I need to think
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.500]   that needs to be part of our event?
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.340]   - Right.
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.980]   And so one of the things that you're gonna be deciding
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.900]   very early is who's going to be attending
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.780]   because buying tickets or going somewhere
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.740]   with a smaller group versus a larger group
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.340]   is gonna direct where you're going.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.820]   So planning who's going to be attending in your community
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.500]   and choosing your venues.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.260]   So where are we going to be eating?
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.460]   Is this going to be a fine, like for budget?
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.460]   Maybe we're going to have the dinner
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.540]   be a fine dining experience at someone's home on Fine China.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.900]   And then we go out and go to a theater experience
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.020]   or a symphony so that we try to keep the budget down.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.220]   So you wanna start thinking through like,
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.660]   what is our budget?
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.620]   How much can people afford?
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.460]   What venues will we be going through?
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.660]   And then what are we going to be doing to practice?
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.420]   Like the practice manners,
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.420]   are we going to just kind of throw them in there
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.700]   and say, good luck and see how it goes?
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.260]   - That does not go well.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.980]   That does not go well.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.340]   - Are we gonna have conversations ahead of time?
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.740]   Are we ensuring that the Challenge 2 students,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.940]   like I just said, are aware that we are leading
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.300]   a conversation about the arts as we're there?
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.500]   Not in a formal, like this is a five common topic
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.260]   conversation about the arts, but across dinner,
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.500]   how would you actually have a conversation about the arts?
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.100]   And then thinking through chaperones, transportation,
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.220]   how are you going to get there?
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.140]   Those are all things that we wanna put in our minds
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.660]   as we start planning and thinking through the elements of it.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.340]   - That is very helpful.
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.220]   That is very helpful.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.740]   You touched on a lot of things.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.740]   And I would encourage planners to think,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.860]   okay, Deb has a good point.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.620]   How big is my group?
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.900]   If you're trying to take 60 people to a symphony,
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.980]   you're gonna have trouble finding,
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.060]   unless you planned way in advance,
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.820]   you're gonna probably have trouble finding seats together.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.220]   And so you have to consider that.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.380]   And you also have to consider transportation.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.180]   A lot of fine dining restaurants
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.540]   are not as big as the cafeteria.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.220]   So you have to think about when to go
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.220]   and how to break that down even.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.060]   And price, you need to think about all the elements.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.380]   So you wanna find dining experience.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.740]   You want some kind of cultural event.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.140]   I love that you brought up practicing.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:28.140]   I've talked to directors before who have parents in,
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.340]   the parents of some of the students host practice sessions
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.740]   where they talk to the students about the place settings.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.100]   And they put all of the pieces out there,
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.940]   probably more pieces than will be at the restaurant
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.380]   on protocol night.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.780]   But all of the things,
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.340]   they tell them where to place their napkin,
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.740]   how to pull out their partner's chair.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:54.740]   Like you said, how to start a conversation about the arts
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.220]   or about the performance.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.220]   We're about to enjoy and they bring in people
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:06.260]   who will model that good behavior for them.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.460]   - That's great.
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:12.020]   Parents helping out with this is so important.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.900]   It's such a blessing to the Challenge II directors as well.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.820]   I know Challenge II directors are already trying
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.820]   to fit so much into the community day
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.100]   and they're probably going,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.740]   how on earth am I going to talk about manners
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.540]   in the middle of doing policy or whatever it might be?
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.100]   - It really doesn't fit well into your day,
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.500]   into your community day.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.820]   Your community day is so full.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.660]   - It is.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.100]   And so to have parents who do what you just said,
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.780]   we had the same thing in our community
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:45.420]   that host a manners night and they bring everybody up
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.660]   and they have a nice formal dinner
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.980]   and just talk about how do you pull out a chair well.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.260]   And it doesn't have to be elaborate.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.380]   - Somebody on with a coat or off with a coat.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.620]   When do you clap at the symphony
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.100]   and when do you not clap at the symphony?
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.780]   You know, if opera is in a language you can't understand,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.100]   is there any help for you?
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.260]   And there always is, but knowing that going in
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.500]   can help you enjoy the experience a little bit more.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.100]   - Right, and again, it's taking that fear away
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.380]   that we talked about earlier.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.260]   You know, that fear of like,
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.220]   I'm not gonna know what to do when I get there.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.660]   And so that chance to practice
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.260]   and some communities get that time
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.380]   and some communities don't
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.660]   and it shouldn't stop us from having a protocol of that.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.020]   - Exactly, we can all have a practice together.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.820]   - You know, we can practice, we can practice at home.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.820]   We can have, parents can have conversations at home
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.860]   depending on how your community works, right?
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.140]   But ultimately to have that support come in from a family
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.060]   to be able to say, "Hey, we could practice."
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.180]   That's lovely, right?
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.020]   - It is lovely.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.500]   - It just helps get things prepared
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.860]   and helps get the mindset right for the protocol event.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.780]   - But I really appreciate the reminder
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.060]   that if you are a director and you don't have a parent
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.220]   step in and offer to host a practice,
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.180]   that is not a reason to forego protocol.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.900]   Here's the truth.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.780]   You can enlist some chaperones that you know
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.060]   have good manners or have practice in fine dining
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.860]   or in cultural arts experiences.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.980]   And it has happened before with classes
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.260]   that I have been the chaperone with
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.100]   that the chaperone will lead the way.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.260]   So if you sit down and there are too many forks
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.740]   and as a student, you don't know what to do.
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.500]   If the students know they can look to the chaperone
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.300]   and the chaperone will not in a call attention
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.580]   to their confusion way, but in a natural way,
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.820]   pick up the correct fork and spoon the soup the correct way.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.300]   It's very helpful.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.380]   - Oh yes, it's like on the job training, right?
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.380]   And so you're sitting there and like, who do I watch?
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.580]   Who's going to model for me?
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.940]   If I don't know ahead of time,
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.060]   there's always someone that you can watch
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.060]   and just kind of side glance to.
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.980]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.540]   - Well, how is she doing that?
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.980]   Or how is he doing that?
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.140]   And, you know, if we mess up too,
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.300]   I think that that's important for students to know as well.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.420]   You know, oh no, I dropped my roll
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.180]   and it's rolling across the floor.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.300]   - And how to help that student gracefully recover from that.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.300]   - Exactly.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.740]   - How to deflect attention away from the dropped spoon
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.860]   or the spilled iced tea, you know?
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.860]   - Right, it's gonna happen.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.820]   And if it happens,
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.020]   then we learn how to handle that with grace
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.820]   and with not embarrassing someone,
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.100]   but, you know, making someone feel comfortable.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.060]   What a beautiful gift that can be to a person.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.940]   - And really that is the point of protocol, right?
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.460]   Making sure that you yourself can be comfortable,
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.340]   but making the ones who are with you
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.740]   comfortable in the situation.
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.340]   A lot of times our students may graduate
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.900]   and go on to situations
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.860]   where they may be the only one in their peer group
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.060]   who does know how to gracefully move through
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.820]   different kinds of experiences.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.660]   And what a joy if we have raised students
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.940]   who know how to act and know how to gracefully,
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.420]   helpfully bring their friends along.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.020]   That's a great thing.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.460]   So talk to me about some of the things that you've heard,
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.100]   'cause I know as an academic advisor,
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:26.420]   you have talked to tons of challenge to communities
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.300]   and tons of challenge parents
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.460]   that have done a whole lot of different things for protocol.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.900]   What are some suggestions that you've heard about
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.580]   or even some of the ones you've attended yourself?
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.460]   - Yeah, so I can speak first to my own community.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.020]   We've had some wonderful events planned.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.740]   We've gone to the symphony.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.420]   We've heard a score done like live to a film.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.860]   So that was interesting.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.900]   - Oh, that's cool.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.180]   - Yeah, and then we've also done a,
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:02.380]   it was a like a fine dance where it was learning the,
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.700]   learning how to do like the real
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.900]   and the country English dance,
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.260]   like the type of dances. - Oh my goodness.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.700]   Like in some of the novels
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.540]   that they read in challenge too.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.940]   - Yes, like in "Pride and Prejudice".
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.900]   So it was an integration of the culture
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.620]   in "Pride and Prejudice"
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.740]   and having them learn how to do those.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.900]   Like, so we did fine dining
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.380]   and then they learned how to do the real
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.420]   and the English country dance
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.180]   and all those fun regency dances.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.900]   And so depending on the year
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.580]   and what your community might like to do,
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.340]   I know that this year we're going to see
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.980]   a theater presentation.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.340]   So we're going to, it's called "The Thorn"
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.340]   and it's a theater and dance presentation of the gospel.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:50.060]   So that was a new thing that came into.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.700]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.700]   That's the first time doing this one.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:58.180]   But so live theater, the symphony, the opera,
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.220]   all of these things are excellent opportunities.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.300]   I know of another community
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.860]   that took their students to,
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.740]   you already go to the museum for challenge too,
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.740]   but they went to a museum
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.260]   and as they finished their museum,
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.100]   there was live music in the museum.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.820]   And so they went around
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:21.260]   and walked in their lovely evening wear.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.740]   They walked around and saw art
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:27.020]   and then they sat and listened to a live piano presentation
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.540]   at the museum afterwards.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.700]   And that was their event.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.220]   So it depends on the area that you're in
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.740]   and what you can find.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.380]   But we're trying to have it be about culture,
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.540]   not about pop culture.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.060]   And I think that that's the difference
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.140]   is that we want it to be a cultural experience,
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.140]   not a pop culture.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.460]   So, going to the latest Taylor Swift concert does not-
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:49.300]   - That does not qualify.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.300]   - Really hit the moment of what we're trying to do here.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.860]   So just making sure that we're looking at the fine arts
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.660]   versus pop culture.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.300]   - That is an awesome reminder.
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.940]   Thank you very much for that reminder.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.140]   That's very important.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.300]   And you mentioned that I love the idea
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.860]   of learning some of the dances
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.220]   like from "Pride and Prejudice."
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   And our community also has rotated through a lot of that.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.940]   And they don't do a dance every year,
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.420]   but maybe every third year.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:24.020]   So that once while the students are in attendance,
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.580]   in the attendance age zone,
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.140]   they might get some of that dance.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.900]   And then we try to mix it up
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.340]   so that they get some symphony, some theater,
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.980]   maybe a ballet,
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:40.860]   and maybe some quote-unquote practical dancing,
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.060]   some dance dancing that they can do.
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.660]   I know that from the fine dining standpoint,
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.260]   it really does depend on what's available to you.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.740]   It may be that you're in an area
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.980]   where there aren't a lot of fine dining restaurants
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.940]   or in an area where there are lots
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:01.100]   and they're so expensive that nobody can bear that cost.
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:05.220]   You mentioned earlier that perhaps
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:12.020]   a family would host a class for a formal dinner.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.500]   - Absolutely.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.820]   So I think it's nice to be able to
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.340]   obviously consider the budget, right?
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.300]   And then if you have a family who has,
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.740]   and you have a tendency to do like a challenge one
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.140]   to challenge more protocol event
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.060]   that they might have multiple children
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.380]   who are attending this event.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:37.340]   So being considerate of the budget is a gift to families.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.260]   So asking around,
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.060]   your community is an amazing resource to you.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.780]   So finding out what families might be willing to-
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.980]   - Contribute.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.980]   - Yeah, host, contribute.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.580]   Do you know somebody who is a musician
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.140]   who has an in to a concert that we could attend?
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.900]   There's so many resources that end up popping up
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.100]   that you never even knew existed in your community.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.580]   - And I will.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.420]   Go ahead.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.260]   - Yeah, go ahead.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.260]   No, I was just gonna say, that's just the beauty of it
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.460]   is that we can help each other,
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.820]   that we don't have to be alone.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.260]   This challenge to director is not sitting there on her
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.780]   or his own saying, I have to do all of this
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.660]   that there's a community to support, right?
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:23.660]   I will tell you that many fine restaurants
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:29.460]   and many concert masters and conductors
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:34.460]   and directors of theater productions are very excited
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:39.020]   about bringing a new generation of patron
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.940]   of the arts up to speed.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.940]   And so a lot of times an asking will gain you
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:53.220]   an early tickets to an early performance
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.100]   or a special session with the conductor
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.700]   before the symphony concert begins.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.100]   Some restaurants, if you go midweek
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.540]   and you will go earlier like at five or 5.30,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.140]   they will set aside.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:13.300]   And if you will accept a set meal
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.860]   that they help you to choose,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.900]   it brings the cost down considerably.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:24.140]   People are excited when young people
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.980]   are interested in the arts
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.740]   and they will work with you a lot of times.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.900]   - That's so good.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.700]   And I just have that scripture,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.820]   you have not because you ask not going through my mind.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.220]   And when we just go out there and ask,
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.820]   God just makes a way for so many amazing things
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.020]   in our lives and he goes before us.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.860]   And so to just ask, say,
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.900]   would you be willing to host this group of students
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.900]   and the amazing responses that we get so often,
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.660]   so many people have testimonies
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.340]   of being able to do an event for free
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.340]   because they just, they ask, right?
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.020]   - Right, somebody said, oh yeah,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.900]   we will give you 30 free tickets to this performance.
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.260]   It is an amazing blessing because you are right.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.620]   You said a minute ago, protocol can get expensive
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.100]   and you want to be hospitable
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.380]   to all of the families within your community.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.060]   You mentioned also the girls like, especially the girls,
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.260]   now the boys dress up,
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.460]   but they don't like it as well sometimes.
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.940]   The girls want to dress up.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.220]   And so you have families that are maybe putting out
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.500]   for a new dress or new shoes or a hairdo
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.780]   or a manicure or whatever.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.980]   I would encourage your community to get together
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.940]   and the moms in the community to get together
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.820]   and kind of settle on, what are we going to do?
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.180]   If you know that some people can afford to shoot the moon
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.340]   and some people are on a very restricted budget,
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.140]   it might be kindness to say, we're going to,
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.500]   for this protocol,
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.340]   we're going to wear Sunday morning church clothes, okay?
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.900]   We're not going to wear long dresses
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:08.820]   and we're not going to go anywhere super expensive,
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.660]   or we are going to take in a matinee performance
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.100]   and then go to an early dinner.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:21.020]   There are ways to buffer the cost.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.580]   And I have heard, Deb, I don't know if you've heard this,
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.740]   I've heard of some communities
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.340]   where the students might even do a fundraiser
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.500]   that helps defray the cost of protocol for the whole class.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.220]   - Yeah, it's definitely, I was just going to say that,
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.740]   there are many fundraisers that happen
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.940]   or people hold different events as a fundraiser
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.140]   that just helps eliminate the costs completely.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.540]   So it depends on, as the earlier you start planning,
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.060]   the earlier you can start doing the fundraising
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:56.060]   and then you have a pot of finances to pull from
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.980]   and be able to bring the costs down for families,
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.220]   which again is a blessing.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.900]   And it also requires the work, right?
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.260]   So you have to do the work of the fundraising.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.660]   But often communities like to pitch in for that
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.140]   and to see that kind of teamwork come forth
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.660]   to be able to have that event.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.020]   And it shows that it's important, that it's a priority.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.220]   - That's exactly right.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.840]   - That we aren't just going to like do it last minute,
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.860]   but instead that we're building up to this
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.340]   because we believe it's important
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.380]   and we believe that this cultural event
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.500]   is a milestone in your education.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.740]   - That's really good.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.060]   That's a great reminder.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.020]   Okay, we're coming to the end of our time
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.980]   together, I want to give you a chance.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.700]   I know that as a director and probably as a parent,
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.260]   you have seen more than one protocol.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:48.100]   Are there any funny or touching memories that you have
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.020]   or that you've heard about protocol?
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.220]   - There are so many.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.220]   I think just the kids themselves, watching them interact,
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.220]   watching them attempt to, you know,
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.620]   act with this at a new level of dignity, I guess.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.820]   But they also, I know for us specifically,
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.820]   when we did the Regency dance and watching how
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:18.860]   they had to switch partners all the time, right?
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.140]   And so it wasn't just us putting a circle
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.780]   around the dance floor and jumping up and down.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.020]   And, but it was like, they had to learn
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.140]   how to have another partner and move around the dance floor
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:34.140]   with other partners and ask for someone's hand to dance
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.860]   and just these different things.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:41.860]   But the interactions of the kids to be able to interact
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.540]   with somebody that they've never interacted with before
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.700]   and get to know other students was beautiful.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.900]   And I loved the element of that
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.860]   in one of our protocol events.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.860]   I also loved watching students almost gasp
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.540]   at times when there was this beautiful piece of music.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.380]   - Yes.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.540]   - And it just kind of took their breath away.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.860]   And they went, "Ah!"
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.420]   'Cause the soloist was just stunning
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.300]   in what she did on the violin
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.380]   and the way that she performed.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.380]   And to hear that right next to you as a chaperone
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.140]   and you hear that gasp, like, "Ah, that was beautiful."
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:20.980]   - Yeah.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.380]   - That is, just those moments of appreciating the beauty
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.180]   is just, it's just lovely.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.460]   - You're giving me chills.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.500]   I love it when I catch the expression on a kid's face
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.700]   who really did not wanna go to the symphony
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.180]   and they are transfixed by what's happening
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.580]   and then transported to some other plane
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.540]   by the beauty of the music.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.660]   They really, maybe for the first time,
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:50.660]   felt how someone's passion for playing or singing
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:56.780]   is used as a vehicle for connecting
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.060]   with what is truly beautiful.
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.020]   And it's saying, it makes the soul sing.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.060]   It is a soul connection.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.380]   And to see those students realize
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.580]   that that experience exists
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.020]   and that it's open to them
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:18.020]   and that they can participate in it is beautiful.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.260]   - It is.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.620]   And then, of course, you're gonna have on the other end,
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.580]   I just have to say someone like my son,
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.700]   who said, "This is gonna be the best nap I've ever taken."
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:28.900]   - Oh, my word.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:29.740]   Yes.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.700]   - Somebody's like trying to keep himself awake
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.060]   through the classical music, 'cause, you know.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.860]   And so you have on one side, somebody who's like,
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.060]   and then you have on the other side,
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.500]   the guy's like starting to fall asleep.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.540]   And it's just hilarious to see, you know,
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.260]   the process that kids go through.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.100]   But all of those, like my son now, he's graduated college,
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.780]   and he would just say like all of those things
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.060]   have made him a better person as he's watching.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:56.900]   - There you go.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.300]   - He loves and appreciates the arts now.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.740]   He truly does.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.580]   And he would just say,
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.860]   "That was the most expensive nap I've ever taken."
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.660]   - Well, it's so funny.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.420]   But at least he'll never be able to say
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.300]   that he's never been to a concert like that before.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.460]   - And he loves it now.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.380]   So that's great as well.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.780]   But it's just funny the way that, you know,
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.380]   at our different stages of life,
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.620]   but we're introducing it, right?
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.820]   So we're gonna have the funny moments,
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.300]   you know, the spilled drink,
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.620]   or the nap at the concert,
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.300]   or the beautiful moments where they're interacting
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:36.220]   and they're seeing the beauty of all of that music.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.060]   - Yep, yep.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.380]   Protocol is a great introduction
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.940]   to the finer things of life
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.780]   that our students may not appreciate fully right away,
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.980]   but that's what an introduction is all about.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.820]   It's a shaking hands.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.060]   It is a first acquaintance for many of them
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.060]   with something that they may grow
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.380]   to appreciate more and more.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:59.340]   Deb, thank you so much for talking to me about protocol.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.380]   And I feel like our listeners have benefited
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.540]   from what you had to say.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.220]   I really appreciate you.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.420]   - Yes, thank you so much.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.380]   I hope everyone has an amazing protocol.
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.660]   - Yes, I know.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.220]   And that you fall in love with art and music
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.260]   in a whole new way.

[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:20.540]   I wanna talk to you guys about the Delightful Art Company.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.940]   I don't know if you have heard about Delightful Arts before,
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:29.940]   but it is a great way to learn about a lot of stuff
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.540]   while you are participating in art.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.260]   They are art integrated classes
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.700]   that allow you to transform learning
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:44.700]   into an experience that combines academics and creativity.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.820]   Delightful Art has classes for all ages.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.060]   If you are interested,

[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:10.820]   Classical Conversations families get $10 off any live class
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.300]   with a coupon code, okay?
