[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.680]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.580]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.940]   Today, we're talking all about habits.
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.200]   In particular, we're going to discuss the biology
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.760]   of habit formation and the biology of how we break habits.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.420]   I think we can all appreciate the value of having habits.
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.720]   Habits organize our behavior into more or less
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.500]   reflexive actions, so we don't have to think too much
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.120]   about performing the various behaviors that, for instance,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.360]   allow us to brush our teeth or which side of bed
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.880]   we roll out of in the morning.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.440]   And then of course, habits can be more elaborate too.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.060]   We can be in the habit of exercising
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.520]   at a particular time of day.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.200]   We can be in the habit of eating certain foods.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.560]   We can be in the habit of saying
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.720]   or not saying certain things.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.460]   But of course, there are many habits
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.760]   that don't serve us well, or that perhaps even undermine
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.080]   our immediate and long-term health goals
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.660]   and psychological goals, and even some habits
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.460]   that can really undermine our overall life goals.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.640]   So today, we're going to talk about making,
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.560]   meaning forming, and breaking,
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.980]   meaning stopping various habits.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.720]   There's a lot of information out there about habits.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.220]   You'll find this in the popular sphere.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.740]   There are books, there are articles,
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.780]   there are workshops, and so forth.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.800]   However, lesser known is that there's a whole neuroscience
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.780]   of habit formation and habit breaking,
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.280]   and there's a whole field of psychology
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.120]   devoted to understanding habit formation and habit breaking.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.360]   And within those scientific literatures,
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.180]   I think there are some real gems
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.400]   that at least to my knowledge,
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.000]   we haven't paid too much attention to
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.500]   in the popular sphere.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.320]   So today, we're going to talk about the biology
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.360]   of habit formation and habit breaking.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.040]   I'm also going to spell out two specific types
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.880]   of habit formation and habit breaking programs.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.240]   I'm going to boil these down to some very explicit steps
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.280]   that anyone can use.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.560]   My reasoning for doing that is, first of all,
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.640]   it's the end of 2021.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.680]   Many people are thinking about New Year's resolutions.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.120]   They're thinking about leaving some things behind
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.160]   from 2021 and previous,
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.580]   and acquiring some new behaviors,
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.920]   taking on some new challenges,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.700]   and trying to bring new things to their lives.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.100]   But regardless of when you're listening to this,
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.760]   the programs that I'll outline
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.200]   are grounded in the neuroscience
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.040]   and biology of habit formation,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.280]   and they map very well to what the psychologists
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.080]   have described in terms of habit formation and breaking.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.560]   So today, you're going to learn a lot of science.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.720]   You're also going to come away with some practical tools,
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.800]   and I'm certain that regardless of your present state
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.480]   or goals, there'll be something of value to you.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.080]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.840]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.560]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.360]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.840]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.380]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.280]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.880]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.080]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.480]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.640]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.160]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.660]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.220]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.320]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.560]   is that because of the ingredients it contains,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.840]   I know that I'm covering all of my foundational needs
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.220]   for vitamins, minerals, and probiotics.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.900]   There is a wealth of knowledge now pointing to the fact
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.540]   that the so-called gut-brain axis is important
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.240]   for our brain health, for our metabolic health,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.520]   for our hormone health, for our immune system,
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.240]   so the probiotics, vitamins, and minerals
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.720]   really support that system,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.000]   and many of the other things it contains
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.120]   generally support our health in terms of neural system,
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.520]   meaning the brain, the spinal cord, et cetera.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.120]   Basically, Athletic Greens has all the things I need,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.260]   nothing I don't, and by taking it once or twice a day,
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.220]   I always feel better,
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.920]   and I know that I'm covering all my bases.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.320]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.200]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.320]   to claim a special offer.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.920]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.720]   that make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.440]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.080]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.880]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.340]   to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs,
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.360]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.620]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.080]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.640]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.240]   to help you better understand your body
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.160]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.040]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.680]   for the simple reason that most of the factors
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.720]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.160]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.520]   And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.660]   you can also get insights into your particular needs
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.080]   for your genetic type.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.280]   Now, a major issue with a lot of blood tests
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.360]   and DNA tests out there is you get the numbers back,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.540]   you get a lot of information back,
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.560]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.360]   Inside Tracker makes that very easy.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.600]   They have a personalized platform
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.260]   where you get your numbers and it points to specific things
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.340]   that you can do in terms of behavioral protocols,
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.560]   meaning things you perhaps should do more of or less of,
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.660]   nutritional protocols,
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.600]   things that you perhaps should ingest more of or less of,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.400]   and various things that you might consider
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.640]   for more elaborate directed approaches
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.060]   to adjusting the numbers in your blood and DNA profiles.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.320]   Another feature of Inside Tracker
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.520]   is that it has what's called the inner age test.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.720]   This test allows you to see what your biological age
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   and compare that to your chronological age.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.240]   And of course, your biological age
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.800]   is the one that you can control,
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.240]   and that's the one that's really important
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.160]   to your immediate and long-term health.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.540]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.440]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.520]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.600]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.580]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.700]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.180]   that I truly believe are the best out there.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.040]   I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress for about a year now,
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.140]   and it's the best sleep I've ever had.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.740]   One thing that makes Helix mattresses really unique
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.480]   is that they are tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.220]   You can go to their website, you take a quiz,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.740]   it only takes about two minutes,
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.660]   and it will match your body type and sleep preferences
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.060]   to a particular mattress.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.460]   So it will ask you questions such as,
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.040]   do you sleep on your side, your back, or your stomach?
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.680]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.240]   Maybe you don't know.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.920]   You answer those questions and it matches you
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.640]   to the mattress that's right for you.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.600]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.960]   I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm, not too soft.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.520]   Anyway, I matched to the Dusk.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.800]   I've been sleeping on a Dusk mattress,
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.420]   and as I mentioned before,
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.040]   it's been the best experience for me.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.020]   My sleep is so improved.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.580]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.880]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.140]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.460]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.320]   and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.740]   and two free pillows.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.400]   Again, go to helixsleep.com/huberman, take their quiz,
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.200]   match to the mattress that's right for you,
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.140]   and if you decide to purchase it,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.960]   you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.160]   and two free pillows.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.600]   They have a 10-year warranty,
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.000]   and if you want to try it out,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.060]   you can do that for 100 nights risk-free.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.320]   They'll even pick the mattress up for you
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.160]   if you don't love it,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.240]   but I'm pretty confident that you will.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.060]   Again, helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.120]   is where you'll find a Helix mattress for you.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.800]   Let's talk about habits,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.640]   and anytime we're talking about habits,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.120]   that means our nervous system learns something.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.840]   Now, many people think that habits are just like reflexes,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.260]   but pure reflexes are things like the eye blink reflex.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.640]   You know, something comes toward your eye
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.540]   and you don't want it to get in your eye.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.540]   You'll blink.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.880]   Or if you happen to step on a sharp object
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.200]   or get too close to something that's too hot,
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.920]   you'll reflexively move away.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.840]   Those aren't habits.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.200]   Those are what we call hardwired reflexes.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.560]   Habits are things that our nervous system learned,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.900]   but not always consciously.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.160]   Sometimes we develop habits that we're not even aware of
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.360]   until they become a problem,
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.980]   or maybe they serve us well, who knows?
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.340]   But the fact of the matter is
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.280]   that habits are a big part of who we are.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.420]   What we do habitually makes up much of what we do entirely.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.820]   In fact, it's estimated that up to 70%
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.480]   of our waking behavior is made up of habitual behavior.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.580]   So you can imagine that there's a lot of biology,
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.860]   meaning cells and hormones and neural pathways, et cetera,
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.740]   that are going to support the development of those habits.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.440]   So if habits are largely learned,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.120]   consciously or unconsciously,
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.220]   we have to ask ourselves, what is learning?
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.500]   Well, learning is neuroplasticity.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.400]   Neuroplasticity is simply the process
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.260]   by which our nervous system changes
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.240]   in response to experience.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.960]   We have to ask, what changes?
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.840]   Well, what changes are the connections between neurons.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.240]   Neurons are just nerve cells.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.680]   They communicate with one another by electricity
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.080]   and by sending chemical signals to one another
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.640]   that inspire the next neuron and the next neuron
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.280]   to either be electrically active or not.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.260]   But at the end of the day,
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.440]   neuroplasticity is about forming new neural circuits,
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.660]   new pathways by which certain habits are likely to occur
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.300]   and other ones are less likely to occur.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.020]   So we've got habits.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.600]   We have that habits are learned.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.640]   We have that learning involves neuroplasticity
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.620]   and that neuroplasticity involves changes
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.140]   in the connections between neurons, nerve cells.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.920]   Okay, so that describes habits
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   through the lens of neuroscience and biology.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.140]   But as many of you are well aware,
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.900]   there are popular books about habits
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.080]   and there's a whole psychological literature about habits.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.060]   And those two areas point to some very interesting aspects
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.120]   of habits that I think are worth mentioning.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.600]   First of all, is this notion of immediate goal-based habits
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.440]   versus identity-based habits.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.720]   Immediate goal-based habits are going to be habits
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.040]   that are designed to bring you a specific outcome
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.880]   as you do them.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.600]   So each and every time you do them.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.240]   So for instance, it might be that you want to develop
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.240]   a habit of getting 60 minutes of zone two cardio each day
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.640]   or perhaps, you know, three, four times a week
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.880]   as we head into the new year.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.600]   I've talked before on the podcast
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.480]   about the fact that the scientific literature
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.880]   and the health literature really points
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.200]   to the incredibly positive effects
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.440]   of getting 150 minutes to 180 minutes per week minimum
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.280]   of what's called zone two cardio.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.140]   Zone two cardio is basically any cardiovascular exercise
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.760]   that gets you moving and your heart pumping and breathing
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.160]   but not so hard that you can't hold a conversation.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.800]   As it kind of puts you at the threshold
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.860]   of being just able to have a conversation
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.980]   that's a little bit strained,
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.980]   but if you were to exercise a little bit harder,
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.120]   you know, run a little bit faster, et cetera,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.600]   you wouldn't be able to talk while you did it.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.180]   There's a lot of literature that points to that
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.680]   as a healthy practice.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.120]   So maybe you're somebody that wants to get more
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.840]   of zone two cardio, for instance.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.880]   That would be an immediate goal-based habit.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.880]   If your goal is to get that cardio maybe four times a week,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.240]   every time you do it, you could check off a little box
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.560]   and you'd say, okay, I did it.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.520]   You met the goal.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.080]   That is different than so-called identity-based habits
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.560]   where there's a larger overarching theme to the habit
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.780]   where you're trying to become quote unquote a fit person,
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.200]   or you're somebody who wants to be an athlete
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.160]   or something of that sort.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.760]   It's where you start to attach some sort of larger picture
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.320]   about yourself or what it means for you to do that habit
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   where there's both the immediate goal, right?
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.960]   Complete the exercise, complete the session
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.340]   or whatever it is.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.580]   Check off that box, but that you're linking it
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.900]   to some sort of larger goal.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.360]   Now, why am I making this distinction?
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.940]   I mean, first of all, I'm not the one
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.200]   to first make this distinction.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.360]   Others have made the distinction between identity
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.900]   versus immediate goal-based habit formation.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.240]   But the reason I'm making the distinction
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.360]   is that pretty soon in our discussion today,
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.460]   we are going to talk about dopamine,
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.240]   a molecule that's associated with motivation and reward
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.320]   that we make in our brain
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.380]   and how different schedules of dopamine release
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.800]   predict whether or not we will stick to a habit or not.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.520]   And in particular, whether or not we will be able
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.420]   to form that habit quickly or not.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.320]   Now, this is absolutely critical to understand
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.800]   for the following reason.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.940]   Another thing that you'll hear out there in the literature
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.280]   is that it takes 21 days to form a habit.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.640]   Some people say 18, some people say 21,
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.440]   some people say 30 days, some people say 60 days.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.300]   So which one is it?
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.500]   Does it depend on the habit that one is trying to form
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.660]   or does it depend on the person
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.400]   that's trying to form the habit?
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.880]   Well, it turns out that there's excellent peer review data
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.720]   on this.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.980]   There's a study published in 2010,
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.040]   first author, Lally, L-A-L-L-Y.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.440]   This study found that for the same habit to be formed,
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   it can take anywhere from 18 days to as many as 254 days
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.600]   for different individuals to form that habit.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.360]   The reason I bring this up is that I always get asked,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.000]   is it true that it takes 21 days to form a habit?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.600]   Is it true that your nervous system changes in six days
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.640]   when you're doing something repeatedly?
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.980]   And the answer is, as I mentioned before,
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.440]   it's highly variable.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.760]   What I didn't tell you actually was what specific habit
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.020]   they were looking at in that Lally study.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.200]   And it's interesting that the specific behavior
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.640]   was a health-related behavior.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.320]   That's pretty relevant to our discussion here on the podcast,
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.760]   which was taking walks after dinner.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.360]   There's actually a really nice literature showing
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.400]   that walks after a meal can speed glucose clearance
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.120]   from the bloodstream, can be beneficial
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.640]   for not just weight loss, but cardiovascular health, et cetera.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.240]   So a walk after dinner seems pretty straightforward, right?
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.840]   Well, in order to form that habit,
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.080]   it took some people 18 days and other people 254 days.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.440]   How did they know when they formed the habit?
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.720]   Well, they were doing it about 85% of the time.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.400]   And they also reported not having to spend
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   that much mental effort in order to get into the mode
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.920]   of taking a walk after dinner.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.000]   So for those of you listening,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   some of you might be thinking,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.760]   I can't believe that it would take some people 254 days
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.160]   to get into that habit.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.680]   But as I said, people are highly variable.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.120]   And if you can't form one habit easily,
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.560]   it doesn't mean that you can't form other habits easily.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.800]   The mystery of why certain people can form certain habits
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.240]   more easily than others probably has something to do
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.360]   with how well people manage what's called limbic friction.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.380]   Now, limbic friction is not a term that you're going to find
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.680]   in the formal neurobiological literature
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.480]   or even psychological literature.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.120]   It's frankly a term that I coined to encompass a number
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.680]   of different pieces of the psychology
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.460]   and neuroscience literature.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.320]   Limbic friction is a shorthand way that I use
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.120]   to describe the strain that's required
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.980]   in order to overcome one of two states within your body.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.920]   One state is one of anxiousness where you're really anxious
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.500]   and therefore you can't calm down, you can't relax,
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.980]   and therefore you can't engage in some particular activity
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.800]   or thought pattern that you would like.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.200]   The other state is one in which you're feeling too tired
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.660]   or lazy or not motivated.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.980]   Both of those states, feeling too alert and too calm,
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.600]   if you will, relate to the function
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.680]   of the so-called autonomic nervous system,
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.320]   a set of neurons and hormones and chemicals
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.640]   in your brain and body that act as sort of a seesaw.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.160]   You're either alert or calm.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.240]   You're either asleep or stressed.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.280]   Those two states are not compatible with one another.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.960]   You've probably heard of wired and tired,
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.020]   but that's really once you've been very stressed
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.540]   for a long time to the point where you're exhausted.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.840]   What does the autonomic nervous system
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.780]   have to do with any of this?
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.020]   Well, limbic friction is a phrase that can be used
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.920]   to describe how much effort, how much activation energy
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.660]   you need in order to engage in a particular behavior.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.280]   So using this Lally study as an example,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.360]   some people would eat dinner and then say,
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.200]   "Oh, that's right.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.440]   I'm trying to develop the habit
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.040]   of taking a walk after dinner.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.480]   So let's get up and go."
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.320]   Other people will feel like,
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.640]   I just don't want to do it today.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.620]   They're going to feel too much limbic friction.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.720]   And that limbic friction could arrive, again,
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.100]   from one of two sources.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.540]   It could be because they are too tired to do it,
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.680]   or it could be because they're too anxious
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.660]   and distracted in order to do it.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.180]   So this is a key distinction.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.060]   A lot of habit formation has to do
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.940]   with being in the right state of mind
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.400]   and being able to control your state of body and mind.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.700]   So as we march forward, what you're going to find
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.980]   is that this phrase or this term, limbic friction,
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.600]   is going to be a useful metric
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.800]   or way for you to touch in with yourself
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.520]   and address whether or not you are likely to be able
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.140]   to form a certain habit easily
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.220]   or whether or not it's going to be very challenging.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.740]   And I'm going to teach you a way
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.140]   to measure your degree of limbic friction,
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.700]   that is, how much activation energy it will take
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.700]   in order for you to execute a new habit.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.580]   And I'm going to teach you how to measure
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.920]   your limbic friction and activation energy
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.080]   for how likely it is that you're going to be able
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.940]   to break a habit that you don't want to have.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.180]   The other key concept for us to address
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.780]   that's really mainly found in the books and articles
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.940]   out there about habits is this notion
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.840]   of what I call linchpin habits.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.900]   Lynchpin habits are certain habits
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.120]   that make a lot of other habits easier to execute.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.680]   Now, the sorts of linchpin habits that I'm referring to
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.900]   are always going to be things that you enjoy doing.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.440]   I'll just give you an example from my life.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.880]   I happen to like exercise, not all forms of exercise,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.760]   but I happen to like resistance training
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.240]   and I happen to like running.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.340]   So I'm personally in the habit
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.960]   of getting cardiovascular exercise
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.460]   three or four times per week,
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.120]   maybe 30 to 60 minutes per session.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.640]   And I'm in the habit of doing resistance training
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.360]   three or four times per week,
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.960]   typically also for about 45 to 60 minutes per session.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.680]   Now, I enjoy those.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.800]   And for reasons that I'll get into a little bit later,
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.200]   I place those activities typically early in the day
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.600]   because of the neurochemistry
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.000]   and the various types of hormones, et cetera,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.880]   that are associated with performing those activities.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.400]   But I really place those activities under the umbrella
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.020]   of what I call linchpin habits.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.860]   Why?
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.440]   Because those particular habits are easy to execute
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.520]   because I enjoy them,
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.540]   but they also make a lot of other habits easier to execute.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.040]   Things like being alert for work,
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.440]   things like making sure that I get good sleep
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.520]   the night before, things like hydration,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.600]   things like making sure that I eat the foods
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.320]   that are better for me than maybe some of the other foods
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.660]   that I would more reflexively reach to
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.400]   if I weren't doing that training.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.200]   So certain habits act as linchpins,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.360]   meaning that they shift a lot of other things.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.880]   They can control and bias the likelihood that,
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.320]   in this case, you or me,
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.700]   will perform other habits that are harder to access,
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.120]   that we have less of an affinity for.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.000]   So again, there's three concepts
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   that we need to include here.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.020]   We've got identity-based versus goal-based habits.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.900]   We've got the concept that different habits
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.040]   take different periods of time to adopt
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.800]   depending on the person and the habit,
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.780]   and that there are these, what I call linchpin habits,
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.020]   certain habits that make other habits easier to execute.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.260]   And those linchpin habits always, always, always
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.300]   are things that we enjoy doing.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.780]   So our goal throughout this episode
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.240]   is for you to identify which habits
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.060]   are easy for you to perform,
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.040]   which ones are hard for you to perform,
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.000]   and which habits you want to break.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.080]   If you want to grab a pen and paper, you can do that.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.200]   Or if you want to dictate some of that into your phone,
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.300]   you can.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.340]   But right now, actually,
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.520]   if you just want to think about these concepts,
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.980]   can always go back later.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.640]   I'll make sure to spell out a very specific way
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.340]   that you can chart out a map towards forming
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.840]   particular habits and breaking particular habits later on.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.100]   What I'd like us to do at this point
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.980]   is to take that concept of limbic friction
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.360]   and for you to ask yourself
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.380]   what habits you perform on a daily basis.
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.780]   And these could be things as basic as
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.820]   brushing your teeth before breakfast
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.260]   or brushing your teeth after breakfast.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.920]   It could be, for instance, that you get exercise
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.480]   or you get it at a particular time of day,
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.300]   or even that you take a particular route to work, right?
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.440]   We are very habitual and we tend to do things
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.140]   more or less over and over in the same way,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.140]   unless we intervene in ourselves.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.260]   That's just the way that we are wired.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.940]   So now I'd like to shift to thinking about
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.300]   a particular aspect of habits and that's habit strength.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.260]   You all have different habits.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.300]   You probably brush your teeth at a particular time of day.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.800]   You probably exercise at particular times a week.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.140]   You probably go to the refrigerator in a very habitual way.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.340]   We are incredibly habitual organisms.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.800]   Unless we intervene in our habits,
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.260]   they tend to carry out the same way
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.680]   that they always have once they've formed.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.160]   So you can do this exercise now.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.820]   You don't have to write this down if you don't want to,
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.820]   but you certainly are welcome.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.300]   We're going to evaluate what's called habit strength.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.820]   That's not a concept that I created.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.380]   Habit strength is something that you will find
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.180]   in the psychological literature.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.400]   Habit strength is measured by two main criteria.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:02.220]   The first is how context dependent a given habit is.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.940]   So context dependence is
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.460]   if you go from one environment to the next,
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.860]   do you tend to do the same thing in the same way
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.260]   at the same time of day?
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.660]   So for instance, brushing your teeth
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.500]   first thing in the morning,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.080]   maybe some of you do that before breakfast,
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.340]   maybe some of you do that later,
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.920]   maybe some of you like me don't even eat breakfast.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.740]   But when I travel, I tend to brush my teeth
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.900]   at more or less the same time of day
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.420]   relative to when I wake up as I do when I'm at home.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.300]   So it's context independent.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.980]   So it's a very strong habit, right?
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.860]   There are certain behaviors like perhaps what you eat
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.500]   or perhaps how you dress that are context independent
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.880]   that you might perform one way in one context
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.780]   and another way in another context.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.340]   The other aspect of habit strength
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.760]   is how much limbic friction is required
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.020]   to perform that habit on a regular basis.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.620]   This is extremely important
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.300]   because if you were in the process of building habits
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.920]   and consolidating those habits,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.620]   then it's probably going to take more limbic friction
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.260]   to execute those habits.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.020]   Well, let's say you set out to get,
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.700]   let's say 45 minutes of zone two cardio exercise every day,
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.700]   five or maybe even seven days a week.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.940]   Well, if at first you're highly motivated,
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.500]   limbic friction might be pretty low.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.720]   Limbic friction is how much top-down,
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.940]   meaning from your forebrain to your limbic system,
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.060]   the part of your brain that generates autonomic responses,
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.260]   how much limbic friction,
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.260]   meaning conscious override of your state is required
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.420]   in order to engage in that particular behavior.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.740]   So if you're feeling particularly tired
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.060]   and you don't want to get up out of bed
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.740]   and you don't want to go out into your zone two cardio,
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.100]   then there's a high degree of limbic friction.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.340]   It takes more, some people think of it as motivation,
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.340]   but motivation is a bit of a vague concept
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.900]   whereas limbic friction involves specific neural circuits.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.300]   And you can think of it in a more or less quantitative way.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.800]   You can think of that your body is very tired,
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.460]   so it's going to take more limbic friction
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.540]   in order to get into action, right?
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.380]   You're going to have to overcome more limbic friction,
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.220]   excuse me, whereas if you're very, very alert,
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.660]   there's less limbic friction
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.180]   because you're moving towards something
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.820]   that's action-oriented.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.980]   However, the inverse is also true.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.660]   Let's say that you are trying to get into the habit
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.900]   or you're in the early stages of forming a habit
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.600]   to meditate regularly.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.020]   That's a pretty quiescent or calming activity.
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.580]   So if you're somebody who comes home from work
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.340]   and you're very anxious and you have a lot of work to do
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.020]   and you have to deal with a bunch of things,
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.280]   there's a lot of limbic friction to overcome
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.860]   in order to get into that calm state.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.840]   So these two aspects, context dependence,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.500]   whether or not you're likely to do the thing
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.960]   regardless of where you are, right?
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.980]   On travel, at home, on vacation, with people around,
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.520]   not people around, et cetera,
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.020]   and how much limbic friction is required
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.920]   to execute that habit will tell you
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.540]   whether or not that habit is deeply
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.460]   or just shallowly embedded within your nervous system.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.700]   The goal of any habit that we want to form
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.860]   is to get into what's called automaticity.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.820]   Automaticity is fancy language
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.580]   for the neural circuits can perform it automatically.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.100]   And that's the ultimate place to be, right?
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.460]   If you have all these goals
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.380]   and things that you want to be doing on a regular basis,
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.020]   you'd love for them to be habitual
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.980]   because it takes less mental and physical effort,
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.860]   less limbic friction in order to execute those.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.860]   And so much of what's out there,
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.340]   again, in the popular psychology literature,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.340]   in books that you'll find on the bookstore shelf
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.140]   and on Amazon and in the airports,
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.140]   are about how to get from that mode
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.140]   of high degree of limbic friction to automaticity.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.060]   And they offer a number of different ways,
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.060]   I think many of which are useful,
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.220]   trying to get you to organize different types of habits
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.980]   into different bins like value-based and goal-based
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.420]   and trying to persuade you that structuring habits
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.780]   at the particular times of day or in a particular way
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.060]   are going to be beneficial.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.460]   And indeed, I think they have helped a lot of people.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.880]   So what I'd like to do is to take the scientific literature
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.600]   of how the nervous system learns
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.380]   and engages in neuroplasticity
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.900]   and apply that to habit formation, habit maintenance,
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.060]   and if so desired, how to break particular habits.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.820]   I'd like to give you a particular tool
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.100]   that's gleaned from the research psychology literature.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.540]   I should mention that I learned about this
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.540]   from an excellent review article that's available online.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.380]   It's called "Psychology of Habit."
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.060]   The authors are Wendy Wood and Dennis Runger.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.240]   This is published in "Annual Review of Psychology."
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.460]   The annual reviews series is a very high quality series.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.720]   There are annual reviews of neuroscience,
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.080]   annual reviews of psychology,
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.260]   annual reviews of nutrition science, et cetera.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.320]   For those of you that are interested
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.480]   in exploring review articles
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.440]   that are grounded in hundreds
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.480]   of quality peer-reviewed studies,
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.080]   the annual review series is really terrific,
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.320]   certainly among the best, if not the best,
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.880]   and they also tend to be quite long and quite comprehensive.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.160]   So this review, "Psychology of Habit" by Wood and Runger,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.640]   is excellent.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.420]   And here I'm more or less paraphrasing from them,
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.000]   so I want to be clear that these are their words, not mine.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.940]   They're talking about the various ways
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.080]   that habits form in the nervous system.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.780]   And they mention with each repetition of a habit,
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.840]   small changes occur in the cognitive and neural mechanisms
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.660]   associated with procedural memory.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.920]   So I just want to talk for a second
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.980]   about what procedural memory is.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.660]   In the neuroscience of memory,
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.300]   we distinguish between what's called episodic memory
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.880]   and procedural memory.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.380]   Episodic memory is a recall
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.560]   of a particular set of events that happened,
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.440]   whereas procedural memory is holding in mind
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.760]   the specific sequence of things that need to happen
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.880]   in order for a particular outcome to occur.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.640]   So think of it like a recipe or a protocol,
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.540]   or if for sake of exercise, it's like sets and reps
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.560]   or a particular course that you're going to run or cycle
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.480]   or the number of laps you're going to swim
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.280]   and how you're going to perform it.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.160]   It's very clear that for anyone trying to adopt new habits,
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.960]   getting into the mindset of procedural memory
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.500]   is very useful for overcoming that barrier
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.960]   that we call limbic friction.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   How do you do that?
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.200]   Well, a simple visualization exercise,
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.880]   or it doesn't even have to be done eyes closed.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.600]   Oftentimes we hear visualization exercise.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.840]   You think about sitting in a Lotus position, eyes closed,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.420]   and trying really hard to visualize something.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.000]   It doesn't need to be anything like that.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.900]   It can simply be, if you are deciding to adopt a new habit,
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.880]   to just think about the very specific sequence of steps
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.860]   that's required to execute that habit.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.060]   And I'll use a trivial example,
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.020]   but this could be applied to anything.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.660]   Let's say I want to get into the habit of making myself
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.140]   or someone else in my household
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.560]   a cup of espresso every morning.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.180]   I would actually think through each of those steps,
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.220]   walk into the kitchen, turn on the espresso machine,
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.840]   draw the espresso, walking through each of those steps
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.080]   from start to finish.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.720]   And it turns out just that simple mental exercise done once
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.140]   can shift people toward a much higher likelihood
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.080]   of performing that habit regularly,
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.460]   not just the first time,
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.160]   but as they continue out into the days and weeks that follow.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.280]   So that's remarkable to me.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.320]   And the literature is really robust.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.120]   Just one mental exercise of thinking through
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.040]   what are the sequence of steps required
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.880]   in order to perform this habit from start to finish
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.380]   can shift the likelihood of being able to perform that habit
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.780]   from unlikely or to moderately likely
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.440]   to very likely over time.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.880]   And that's because it pulls from this process
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.920]   that involves our hippocampus and our neocortex
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.320]   and other areas of our brain and nervous system
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.920]   that engage in procedural memory.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.680]   It shifts the brain towards a mindset, if you will.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.600]   It's more of a neural circuit set, it would be more accurate,
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.480]   but a mindset/neural circuit set of doing things
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.960]   in a particular sequence,
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.780]   which allows that limbic friction to come down
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.200]   and increases the likelihood
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.660]   that we're going to perform that thing.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.540]   Simple tool, but very powerful tool
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.540]   according to the psychology literature.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.760]   And actually the cellular and molecular mechanisms
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.720]   that underlie that sort of procedural memory
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.760]   stepping through phenomenon are known.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.380]   In this article I mentioned, this beautiful review,
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.520]   they talk about so-called Hebbian learning.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.240]   Donald Hebb was a psychologist in Canada
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.840]   and birthed this field that has now lasted, gosh,
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.900]   more than 50 years and is still very strong
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.580]   in neuroscience and psychology of Hebbian learning.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.380]   Hebbian learning is when particular neurons are co-active,
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.660]   meaning when they fire together,
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.400]   they tend to strengthen their connections with one another.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.640]   And it has a number of different
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.340]   underlying cellular and molecular features
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.760]   that we don't have to go into in detail.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.000]   But for those of you that want to know,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.080]   I know some of you are hungry
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.920]   for a little bit more neuroscience.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.720]   This involves things like NMDA receptors,
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.040]   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.920]   NMDA receptors are really important,
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.660]   I think for everyone to understand.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.280]   So I'll just tell you a little bit about them.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.100]   These are receptors that are on the neuron surface
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.820]   and normally they don't contribute much
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.440]   to the activity of those neurons.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.720]   Those neurons are perfectly capable of doing their thing
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.240]   without activation of this NMDA receptor.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.880]   But when a neuron gets a very strong input,
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.160]   a strong stimulus, that NMDA receptor
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.780]   triggers a number of mechanisms
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.080]   that recruit to the surface of the neuron
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.600]   more other receptors.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.440]   In other words, it makes that neuron more responsive
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.940]   to input in the future,
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.760]   such that it doesn't require so much input.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.480]   In other words, it takes a neuron
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.560]   that is very unlikely to fire
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.440]   and makes it more likely to fire.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.360]   So this procedural stepping through
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.620]   of the steps of the recipe or the series of action steps
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.960]   that are involved in sitting down to study
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.720]   and writing for an hour or generating exercise,
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.640]   whatever it is, the habit that you're trying to learn,
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.360]   when you're doing that exercise,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.720]   it's not as if your nervous system
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.560]   thinks you're actually performing the behavior.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.860]   Your nervous system isn't stupid.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.520]   It's actually a lot smarter than that.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.080]   It knows the difference between a thought and an action.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.360]   But when you do that, it sets in motion the same neurons
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.040]   that are going to be required
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.960]   for the execution of that habit.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.740]   And so when you actually show up to perform that habit,
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.580]   it's as if the dominoes fall more easily.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.460]   It's a lower threshold, as we say,
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.520]   in order to get the habit to perform.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.840]   So heavy in learning, NMDA receptors,
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.320]   all that nuts and bolts stuff,
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.680]   really the guts of the mechanisms of how this works.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.720]   But for those of you that just want to be more habitual
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.960]   about certain things,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.920]   be able to perform certain things more reflexively
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.200]   that you would like in your life,
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.180]   simply take the time, do it once, maybe twice,
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.640]   and just sit down, close your eyes if you like,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.200]   and just step through the procedure
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.160]   of what it's going to take in order to perform that habit.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.120]   The psychology literature, as I mentioned,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.720]   and also the neuroscience literature
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.300]   strongly supports the fact
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.220]   that it is going to make it far easier
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.660]   for you to adopt and maintain that habit.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.580]   And if you are somebody who used to perform a habit
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.040]   and you don't understand why you dropped it
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.520]   and you're frustrated with yourself
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.700]   and you're trying to figure out
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.780]   how you can get back into that habit,
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.140]   well, by all means, lean right back into that habit.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.960]   But if you're having trouble doing that,
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.940]   also just use the procedural memory exercise
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.820]   in order to shift your nervous system
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.060]   toward a higher likelihood
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.120]   that you will return to that habit.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.380]   Just the same way I described
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.780]   for trying to initiate a new habit.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.460]   So now I'd like to discuss a second
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.460]   and what I think is perhaps the most powerful tool
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.040]   for being able to acquire and stick to new habits.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.700]   This tool is rooted in what we call neural circuits.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.200]   And I do think it is important to understand a little bit
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.420]   about how those neural circuits work.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.220]   For those of you that are saying, just tell me what to do,
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.300]   I have to say, as I always say,
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.020]   understanding a little bit or a lot of underlying mechanism
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.200]   will help solidify these concepts for you
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.260]   and will help ensure that the tools that I offer
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.220]   are going to make sense
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.360]   and that they're going to make sense in different contexts
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.860]   and for different types of habits
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.180]   that you're trying to learn.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.860]   So rather than just tell you what to do,
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.780]   I'm going to tell you how this particular tool works.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.740]   And then in doing that,
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.540]   you should be able to apply it to any habit
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.340]   under any conditions.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.320]   The tool that I'm referring to
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.800]   is something called task bracketing.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.900]   And the neural circuits associated with task bracketing
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.560]   are basically the neural circuits
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.140]   that are going to allow you to learn any new type of habit
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.100]   or break any habit that you'd like to break.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.900]   We have in our brain a set of neural circuits
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.740]   that fall under the umbrella term of the basal ganglia.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.020]   The basal ganglia are involved in action execution,
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.580]   meaning doing certain things,
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.900]   and action suppression, not doing certain things.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.180]   In the experimental realm,
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.620]   these are referred to as go, meaning do,
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.540]   or no-go, don't do certain things.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.860]   And some of us fall more into the category
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.360]   of we find it very easy to do certain things,
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.940]   but harder to not do other things.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.820]   Some people have a lot of no-go type circuits
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.860]   that are very robust,
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.140]   and they have a lot of behavioral constraint,
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.980]   but they have a harder time getting into action.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.940]   And some people have a perfect balance of both,
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.160]   but I've never met one of those people.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.720]   So again, drawing from more or less paraphrasing
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.920]   from this beautiful review that I described earlier,
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.500]   an annual review of psychology, excuse me,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.940]   by Wood and Runger,
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.880]   task bracketing involves a particular set of neural circuits
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.040]   within the basal ganglia.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.840]   So I'm going to describe this here again,
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.500]   paraphrasing a sensory motor loop.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.000]   Sensory means just input coming in about sight,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.160]   sounds, tastes, et cetera.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.760]   And then the motor systems,
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.460]   the systems of the brain and body that generate action,
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.320]   taking that information and generating action.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.420]   So it turns out that there's an area of our basal ganglia
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.560]   called the dorsolateral striatum.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   We can use the acronym DLS.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.140]   Again, dorsolateral striatum.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.240]   Dorsal means up, lateral means to the side,
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.080]   so dorsolateral.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.740]   And striatum is a subdivision of the basal ganglia.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:42.220]   And it's very important for the establishment of behaviors
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.220]   that are associated with a habit,
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.160]   but not necessarily the habit itself.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.200]   And beautiful studies in both animals and humans
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.380]   that record the electrical activity
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.060]   in the dorsolateral striatum
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.420]   find that the dorsolateral striatum is associated,
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.520]   meaning it becomes active
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.120]   at the beginning of a particular habit
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.400]   and at the very end and after a particular habit.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.380]   Hence the phrase task bracketing, it brackets the habit.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.440]   Now, other sets of neurons are going to be active
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.240]   during the actual execution of the habit,
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.260]   but what the literature on the dorsolateral striatum
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.600]   tells us is that we have particular circuits in our brain
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.360]   that are devoted to framing the events
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.840]   that happen just before and as we initiate a habit
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.720]   and just after and as we terminate a habit.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.100]   In other words, it acts as a sort of marker
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.300]   for the habit execution,
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.320]   but not the execution of the habit per se.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.460]   This is very important because task bracketing
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.360]   is what underlies whether or not a habit will be
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.300]   context dependent or not,
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.420]   whether or not it will be strong and likely to occur
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.640]   even if we didn't get a good night's sleep the night before,
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.400]   even if we're feeling distracted,
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.800]   even if we are not feeling like doing something emotionally,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.100]   or if we are completely overwhelmed by other events,
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.980]   if the neural circuits for task bracketing
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.500]   are deeply embedded in us,
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.600]   meaning they are very robust around a particular habit,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.220]   well, then it's likely that we're going to go out
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.380]   for that zone two cardio no matter what,
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.200]   that we're going to brush our teeth no matter what.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.080]   In fact, brushing our teeth is a pretty good example
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.620]   because for most people,
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.800]   even if you've got a terrible night's sleep,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.840]   even if everything in your life is going wrong,
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.440]   chances are, unless you're very depressed,
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.880]   if you're going to leave to work, or even if you're not,
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.280]   that you're going to still carry out the behavior
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.580]   of brushing your teeth in the morning.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.240]   I would hope so actually,
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.600]   but you are probably less likely to perform
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.020]   particular habits that are not what you deem as necessary.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.840]   But if you think about it, brushing your teeth,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.740]   exercise, eating particular foods,
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.940]   maybe engaging socially in particular ways,
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.400]   you are the one that places any kind of value assessment
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.800]   on which ones are essential and which ones are negotiable.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.600]   So task bracketing sets a neural imprint,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.160]   a kind of a fingerprint in your brain
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.320]   of this thing has to happen at this particular time of day,
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.600]   so much so that it's reflexive.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.360]   And as we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.740]   there's a way that you can build up task bracketing
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.660]   so that regardless of what it is you're trying to learn,
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.480]   there's a much higher probability
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.200]   that you're going to do that thing.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.840]   And when I say learn, meaning,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.240]   let's say you're trying to acquire a habit
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.640]   that for you is really challenging.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.240]   Maybe it's that you're going to write for an hour a day
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.180]   on a book project that you've been thinking about,
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.240]   or you're going to work on mathematics,
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.280]   or you're going to do any sort of thing that for you,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.020]   there's a lot of limbic friction.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.880]   While it is important to think about the sequence of events
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.440]   that would be required in order to engage in that behavior,
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.000]   that procedural memory visualization exercise
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.380]   we talked about before, that will help.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.840]   There is a way also that you can orient your nervous system
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.560]   toward this task bracketing process
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.840]   so that your nervous system is shifted or oriented
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.980]   towards the execution of a given habit.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.140]   So this is sort of like warming up your body to exercise.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.680]   When the dorsolateral striatum is engaged,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.840]   your body and your brain are primed to execute a habit,
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.640]   and then you get to consciously insert
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.200]   which habit you want to perform.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.440]   So in order to leverage the neural mechanisms
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.880]   of task bracketing in order to increase the likelihood
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.640]   that you're going to perform a particular habit,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.380]   I have to break it to you that one thing
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.700]   that you've probably heard over and over
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.060]   about habit formation is not true.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.240]   And what I'm referring to is this idea
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.040]   that if you are very specific about exactly
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.880]   when you're going to perform a particular habit,
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.520]   that you are more likely to perform that habit.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.560]   And while that is true in the short term,
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.320]   it is not true in the longterm.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.880]   And the reason for that is that our nervous system
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.720]   tends to generate particular kinds of behaviors
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.440]   based not on time, but on our state,
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.400]   meaning what level of activation is taking place
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.080]   in our brain and body, how much focus we happen to have,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.340]   how fatigued we are, how energized we are.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.840]   So while schedules are important,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.180]   it's not the specific time of day per se
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.000]   that's going to allow you to get into a habit
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.640]   and form that habit and consolidate that habit.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.100]   Rather, it's the state that your brain and body are in
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.240]   that's important to anchor yourself to.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.280]   So now I'm going to offer you a tool.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.100]   It's actually an entire program
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.640]   by which you can insert particular habits and activities
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.480]   at particular phases of the day,
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.840]   not times of day, but phases of the day,
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.580]   because it turns out that particular phases of the day
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.880]   are associated with particular biological underpinnings,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.260]   chemicals and neural circuits and so forth.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.020]   And in doing so, it will make it far more likely
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.980]   that you'll be able to regularly engage in these habits
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.020]   and activities over a long period of time.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.780]   Now, whether or not that will move you from somebody
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.920]   who ordinarily would take 200 days to form a habit
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.780]   to one of those 18 days to habit people
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.380]   in that earlier study I mentioned, I don't know,
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.960]   but I am certain that it will have a significant shift
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.380]   on allowing you to engage in particular habits more easily
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.700]   and to consolidate those habits more quickly.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.620]   So the program I'm about to describe,
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.140]   I formulated for you based on the neuroscience literature
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.780]   and the psychology literature of learning
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.080]   and this concept of task bracketing.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.260]   It involves dividing the 24 hour days
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.460]   into what I call three phases.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.300]   The first is phase one,
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:24.020]   which is zero to eight hours after waking up, approximately.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.380]   Okay, you can put a plus or minus 30 minutes
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.220]   on this for yourself.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.460]   The second phase is the nine to 14,
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.620]   maybe 15 hours after you wake up.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:38.200]   And the third phase is 16 to 24 hours after waking up.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.740]   So we've taken the 24 hour cycle,
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.720]   we've carved it up into three phases,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.940]   phase one, phase two and phase three.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.820]   Now, everything I'm describing,
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.780]   or at least the way I'm going to describe it
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.400]   is based on what I would call a typical schedule,
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.560]   diurnal schedule.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.620]   You've heard of nocturnal?
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.320]   Well, we are diurnal.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.880]   Most of us are asleep at night and awake during the day.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.100]   I do realize that a number of people have shift work
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.180]   or they have newborns or other reasons
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.720]   why they have to be up in the middle of the night
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.380]   and sleeping during the day.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.860]   If that's the case, please listen to the episode
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.040]   that we did on jet lag and shift work,
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.220]   because it has a lot of tools
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.460]   specifically for that population.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.200]   But most people go to sleep somewhere around 10 p.m.,
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.420]   plus or minus two hours and wake up sometime around 7 a.m.,
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.080]   plus or minus two hours.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.180]   So today I'm going to use the two bed at 10 p.m.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.340]   and the wake up time of 7 a.m. as the framework for this,
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.340]   but you could adopt it easily to your particular schedule.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.900]   Phase one, which again is zero to eight hours after waking,
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.300]   has a particular neurochemical signature.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.140]   Regardless of what you do,
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:46.620]   the neuromodulators norepinephrine as well as epinephrine,
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.700]   so that's noradrenaline and adrenaline,
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.060]   as well as the neuromodulator dopamine
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.360]   tend to be elevated
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.900]   during that first zero to eight hours after waking.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.020]   There are a number of reasons for this
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.140]   related to the fact that also cortisol
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.660]   is higher in our brain and bloodstream.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.840]   It's a healthy level of cortisol upon waking.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.860]   Body temperature is increased, et cetera.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.080]   And there are several things
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.820]   that perhaps we should all be doing.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.380]   I've talked about many of these on the podcast before,
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.660]   that in addition to those chemicals,
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.100]   further support an alert and focused state.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.460]   And I'll just list those off.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.860]   I've done many podcasts on each of these.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.480]   If you'd like to access those podcasts,
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.440]   you can find them in the menu of podcasts
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.500]   on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.820]   They involve, for instance,
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.000]   viewing sunlight or bright artificial light
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.160]   if you can't access sunlight
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.660]   within the first 30 minutes of waking.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.040]   Physical exercise of some kind
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.900]   in this first phase of the day,
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.100]   zero to eight hours of the day,
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.400]   ideally pretty early in that phase.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.540]   But if it has to be at the seven to eight hour
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.420]   transition point, that's fine too.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.740]   Cold exposure in the form of cold showers or ice baths
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.460]   or outside with minimal clothing,
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.980]   appropriate yet minimal clothing.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:02.260]   Caffeine ingestion, fasting, for instance,
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.560]   not ingesting calories also will lend itself
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.720]   to increased norepinephrine, dopamine, et cetera.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.140]   If you are going to consume foods,
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.400]   foods that are rich in things like tyrosine,
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.560]   which is a precursor for dopamine,
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.300]   you can look up which foods are high in tyrosine.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.660]   And for those of you that are interested in supplementation
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.060]   and like to use those routes,
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.700]   things like alpha GPC or phenylethylamine thing
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.580]   or L-tyrosine, if that's in keeping
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.460]   with what you're able to do.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.060]   Of course, consult your doctor
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.260]   if you're going to rely on supplementation.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.120]   What's this all about?
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.060]   Well, the already elevated norepinephrine and dopamine,
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.380]   the sunlight, exercise, cold exposure,
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.420]   caffeine, tyrosine, et cetera,
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.260]   all of those place the brain and body into a state
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.300]   in which you are better able,
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.400]   or I would say more easily able to engage in activities
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.660]   that have a high degree of limbic friction
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.740]   and where you need to override that limbic friction, right?
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.660]   We've heard that the morning is kind of sacred,
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.620]   conquer the hardest things first thing in the morning.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.820]   And that's been discussed in the pop psychology literature
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.040]   and in the habit formation literature,
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.060]   merely from the perspective of get it out of the way
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.480]   so you can feel good about having done it.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.020]   But what I'm referring to is quite different.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.920]   What I'm referring to is a particular phase of day
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.680]   that after rising, after waking up that is,
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.120]   for zero to eight hours, right, in that first phase,
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.480]   your whole system is action and focus oriented.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.300]   And we know that when you are action and focus oriented,
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.540]   and because of the neurochemicals
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.540]   that are naturally released into your brain and body,
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.620]   that you will be more likely to overcome any limbic friction
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.700]   that stands in the way of performing particular habits.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.080]   So as you list out or think about the various habits
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.980]   that you'd like to adopt in your life,
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.380]   take the habits for which you know
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.520]   there's the highest degree of limbic friction.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.580]   They are the hardest for you to engage in.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.900]   They require the most activation energy
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.900]   and put those in this zero to eight hours after waking.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.100]   This will greatly facilitate
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.880]   your performance of those new habits.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.780]   I'm certain of that.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.560]   And in addition to that,
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.540]   by doing them in this particular phase of the day,
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.020]   not necessarily at the same time.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.440]   I mean, if you want to be very habitual
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.980]   and you want to do the exercise or the sunlight viewing
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.380]   always at the same time,
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.020]   or you want to do, you want to drink your caffeine
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.260]   always at the exact same time, that's fine.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.340]   But by placing them in this broader window
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.860]   of zero to eight hours after waking,
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.020]   what you're doing is you're creating task bracketing.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.220]   You're making it such that your nervous system will predict
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.620]   when you are going to lean in against limbic friction
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.420]   in order to perform particular types of habits.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.340]   And this is very different than saying,
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.820]   I'm always going to run,
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:49.120]   or I'm always going to study from 10 to 12 AM every morning.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:49.960]   That's great.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.500]   And if you can do that, terrific.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.700]   But the literature indicates that people who do that,
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.940]   who are very rigid about when they do things,
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.460]   tend because of context dependence
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.960]   to not necessarily stick to those habits over time.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.980]   Some people do, but many, many people don't.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.060]   So think about the hardest habits to form
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.880]   and the habits that you most want to form
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.640]   that are hardest for you to adopt and to maintain.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.960]   And I highly suggest placing those somewhere
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.500]   within this phase one of zero to eight hours after waking.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.740]   Now, of course, some of the things I listed out,
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.600]   sunlight viewing, exercise, cold exposure, caffeine, fasting,
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.080]   those might be the actual habits themselves.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.540]   But here I realize, or rather I want to acknowledge
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.400]   that many people, including myself,
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.700]   are doing some or all of these things already.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.760]   And many people, including myself,
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.460]   are trying to adopt new habits that don't fall
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.800]   into the category of just trying to set your overall state.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.820]   Again, norepinephrine, dopamine,
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.220]   and all these neural systems will be greatly elevated
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.700]   in this zero to eight hours after waking.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.540]   However, the other things I mentioned, sunlight exposure,
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.460]   exercise, cold exposure, caffeine, fasting,
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.620]   if that's for you, or if you're eating during that phase,
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.100]   eating things that contain some or elevated levels
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.900]   of tyrosine, maybe supplementing GPC or L-tyrosine, et cetera.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.760]   All of those things further facilitate the neurochemistry
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.700]   and therefore the state of mind that's going to be ideal
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.440]   for leaning into limbic friction
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.140]   and overriding that limbic friction
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.140]   so that you can regularly perform that habit.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.300]   What we're really talking about here
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:23.100]   is leveraging neural systems in order to help you
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.740]   make it more likely that you're going to be able to engage
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.640]   and maintain a particular habit.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.860]   So what I'm referring to as phase one of each day
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.600]   is useful for acquiring certain habits,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.360]   but there are other phases of the day
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.760]   and those turn out to be useful
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.840]   for acquiring other types of habits.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:43.060]   Phase two, as I mentioned, is about, again,
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.200]   these aren't specifics,
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.640]   but about nine to 14 or 15 hours after waking.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.920]   During this phase of the day,
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.480]   because of the circadian shifts in our biology,
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.260]   the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.540]   that's circulating in our brain and bloodstream
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.120]   tends to start to come down
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.580]   and levels of cortisol tend to start to come down.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.000]   That's the ideal circumstance.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.520]   In fact, you don't really want elevated cortisol
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.360]   late in the day.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.380]   That's actually a signature of depression and anxiety
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.440]   and a number of other unfortunate things.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.740]   So nine to 14 hours after waking,
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.600]   dopamine and norepinephrine and cortisol
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.640]   are starting to taper down just naturally
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.260]   and a different neuromodulator, serotonin,
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.900]   is starting to rise.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.820]   Serotonin is definitely going to be highest
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.940]   in this second half of the day
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:36.680]   and tends to lend itself to a more relaxed state of being.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.120]   Now, of course, I do realize
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.080]   that some people are less of morning people
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.560]   and find that they really come alive
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.620]   and awake in the afternoon,
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.260]   but most people don't fall into that category.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.600]   Most people feel more alert early in the day,
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.180]   even anxious early in the day,
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.660]   and then as the afternoon progresses,
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.580]   they tend to be a bit more sleepy,
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.660]   a bit more relaxed, a bit more calm.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.760]   There are certain things that we all can and should do
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.200]   during this phase two of each day
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.880]   that lend themselves to a state of mind
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.980]   and a state of body that is going to be beneficial
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.300]   for the generation and consolidation
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.960]   of certain types of habits.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.840]   What are those things?
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.400]   First of all, as the day goes on,
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.600]   you should try, if you can,
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:20.080]   to start tapering the amount of light that you're viewing.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.440]   Now, this doesn't mean putting yourself into dim light
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.960]   at three o'clock or four o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.520]   That's certainly not the case.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.420]   Simply that you want to start tapering off
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.800]   the amount of really bright light that you're getting,
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.560]   unless it's sunlight.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.200]   Talked about this before on the podcast,
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.800]   but if you haven't heard,
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.040]   viewing the sun as it's what we call low solar angle,
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.120]   so as it's headed toward the horizon,
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.900]   you don't necessarily have to watch the sunset,
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.160]   although that can be nice,
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.540]   but getting some sunlight in your eyes
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.680]   in the second half of the day can also be beneficial
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.060]   for a number of brain systems and psychological systems.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.640]   So you can get some sunlight in your eyes.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.520]   You can certainly have artificial lights on,
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.400]   but you want to start dimming those lights
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.660]   and bringing them actually physically lower in the room
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.760]   because the neurons in your eye
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.380]   that view the upper visual field,
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.760]   they actually trigger this alertness mechanism
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.600]   in the brain and body.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.160]   And in the second half of the day,
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.340]   even if you're humming around and doing work
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.120]   at three or four or five or even 7 p.m.,
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.720]   you are probably headed towards sleep a few hours later.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.000]   So things like limiting the total amount of light
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.200]   if you can, things like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   Another thing that I've talked about on this podcast,
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.420]   if you haven't heard about this before,
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.360]   non-sleep deep rest is an umbrella term
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.640]   for things like meditation, for yoga nidra,
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.280]   a very powerful science-supported tool
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.740]   for teaching you how to relax.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.240]   Things like self-hypnosis,
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.840]   which might sound a little kooky to some of you,
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.360]   but actually is a clinically-based tool
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.660]   for which there's a lot of scientific literature.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.580]   If you're interested in that,
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:50.160]   there's a great free resource called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.060]   There's a app for both Apple and Android.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.300]   This is an app that was developed by colleagues of mine
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.580]   and researchers at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.900]   You can do these short 15-minute self-hypnosis scripts,
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.820]   as they're called, that can teach you how to relax yourself.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.180]   There's even ones for focus, for sleep, for chronic pain.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.020]   Again, all very strongly supported
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.220]   by quality peer-reviewed literature.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.800]   So things like Reveri, meditation.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:18.220]   Things like heat and sauna, hot baths, hot showers.
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.980]   Those are terrific things to do
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.740]   in the second half of the day.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.100]   They tend to support this serotonergic
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.980]   or high serotonin-like state
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.760]   and lend themselves to more calm and relaxation.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.780]   For those of you that are interested in supplementation,
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.580]   there's always ashwagandha, which reduces cortisol.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.460]   Again, peaks in cortisol late in the afternoon and evening
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.160]   are associated with depression, anxiety, and so forth.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:46.160]   Ashwagandha is a pretty potent cortisol-inhibiting tool.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.780]   I personally don't use it very often,
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.700]   and I caution people about using it
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.360]   for longer than two-week periods of time
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.620]   without taking some breaks.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.940]   You can look up more about ashwagandha on examine.com.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.180]   There's a lot of terrific literature
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.660]   with links to studies there.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.780]   But basically this phase two of the day
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.220]   is one in which you're alert, you are present,
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.180]   you are working, you are engaging socially,
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.020]   you're cooking dinner,
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.080]   probably paying attention to a number of things,
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.100]   but you should really be trying
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.920]   to taper off your stress level.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.820]   So how do you leverage phase two of the day
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.680]   for habit formation?
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.580]   Well, given what we know about the neurochemistry
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.660]   of learning and memory,
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.780]   given what we know about task formation
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.640]   and its reliance on certain forms of neuroplasticity,
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.140]   the second half of the day is a terrific time
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.940]   to take on habits and things that you're already doing
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:34.280]   that require very little override of limbic friction.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.780]   So these might be things that you could categorize
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.260]   in common terms as kind of mellower activities.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.820]   It might be journaling.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:46.100]   It might be that you already are performing music
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.680]   or I should say practicing music regularly,
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.520]   but that there's a particular type of music
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.680]   that is hard for you
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.560]   or that you're working on a particular piece of music,
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.600]   or you're trying to learn a language,
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.100]   something that's a little bit challenging,
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.900]   but doesn't require a ton of energy
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.080]   in order to override that limbic friction.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.600]   The second half of the day is a much better time to do that.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.520]   Less resistance, as we might say.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.980]   But of course, resistance has a neural substrate.
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.640]   And the reason for doing those things
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.960]   in the second part of the day,
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.200]   the so-called phase two, as I've called it,
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.360]   part of the day is because your ability
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:19.040]   to override resistance is really diminished
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.660]   in this second phase of the day.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.320]   Some of you might say, well, wait,
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.300]   I like to exercise in the second half of the day.
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.960]   That's actually when I have the most energy.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.800]   That's when I feel warmer, I'm not a morning exerciser.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.760]   That's absolutely fine.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.320]   What I'm referring to is the acquisition of new behaviors
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.280]   and placing those consistently
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.400]   at the second half of the day
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.040]   in order to engage this task bracketing mechanisms
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.900]   that I talked about before.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.640]   One of the hallmark features
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.440]   of those basal ganglia circuits for go and no-go
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.760]   is that they are associated with certain neurochemicals,
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.880]   dopamine and serotonin, acetylcholine,
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.280]   and other neurochemicals.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.000]   And by placing particular habits
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.700]   at particular phases of the day,
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.200]   those neurochemical states start to be associated
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.360]   with the leaning in and the process of beginning and,
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.800]   as I mentioned, ending those particular habits.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.720]   And in doing so, they shift the whole nervous system
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.220]   toward being able to predict that certain things
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.560]   are going to happen at particular times of day,
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.660]   that you are going to be leaning very hard
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.140]   against limbic friction early in the day in phase one,
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.360]   and that you're going to be doing things
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.860]   that require less conscious override
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.240]   of limbic friction in phase two.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.180]   And in doing so, set up this task bracketing system
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:31.140]   so that the individual habits that you're learning
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.100]   or that you're trying to learn
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.000]   have a much greater probability of being executed
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.920]   and consolidated, meaning that pretty soon
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.320]   they will just naturally become reflexive.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:44.000]   And as with phase one, many of the things that I mentioned
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.700]   that support this, what I'm calling a serotonergic state
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.540]   or a more relaxed state in phase two,
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.540]   things like seeing some light in the afternoon,
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.620]   but not a lot of bright light from artificial sources,
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:00.600]   things like NSDR, things like heat and sauna,
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.820]   hot baths, et cetera, ashwagandha,
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.180]   again, all of those things themselves could be habits
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.980]   that you're trying to adopt, right?
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.100]   In that case, do those if you'd like to explore them.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.980]   They are quite beneficial for a number of reasons,
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.480]   not just related to execution of particular habits
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.860]   in phase two of the day,
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.300]   but also for improving quality of sleep
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.960]   and consolidating any learning
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.580]   that you might've triggered early in the day.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.640]   I've talked about that before,
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.700]   but just briefly as a relevant aside,
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.080]   neuroplasticity involves triggering the neuroplasticity,
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.440]   setting it in motion,
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.640]   but the actual rewiring of the brain
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.160]   and the reconfiguration of neurons
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.220]   that will allow that learning to be reflexive,
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.420]   that actually occurs during states of deep rest,
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.880]   like NSDR and like deep sleep.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.000]   And I should just mention for those of you
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.580]   that can only exercise or prefer to exercise
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.160]   in phase two of the day, right?
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.240]   Nine to 14 hours or 15 hours after waking,
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.920]   that's absolutely fine.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.220]   However, because of the importance of sleep
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.240]   and in particular deep sleep throughout the night
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.840]   for not just neuroplasticity,
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.800]   but recovery of muscle and other tissues
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.300]   that are taxed during physical exercise.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.340]   If you do train in phase two, I highly recommend,
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:13.400]   I highly recommend that you start doing
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.200]   some sort of NSDR type activity after you train
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.320]   within an hour or two,
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.680]   because that will allow you to taper down and relax
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.380]   so that you can get into the next phase
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.720]   we're going to talk about, which is phase three.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.680]   Phase three of the 24 hour schedule
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.400]   runs from about 16 to 24 hours after waking.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.300]   During that period of time,
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.240]   there are a few things that are going to support
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.500]   being in a state of mind, state of body,
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.640]   that are going to allow neuroplasticity to occur,
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.280]   that are going to allow the rewiring that you've triggered
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.740]   during the waking part of the day to actually take place.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.240]   Those things are very low to no light,
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.380]   meaning keeping your environment very dark
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.480]   or very, very dim.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.600]   I don't think it's necessary to sleep in a room
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.480]   that's complete blackness.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.520]   I think that's a little bit overkill,
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.600]   but for most people, keeping the room dark
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.000]   and keeping the room temperature low
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.960]   is very beneficial for getting and staying in deep sleep.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:14.080]   The body has to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.760]   in order to get into sleep and to stay asleep.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.540]   So low light, low temperature environment,
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.360]   you can always pile on blankets, of course,
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.180]   if you don't want to be cold at night,
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.360]   you want to be warm enough,
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.480]   but you want your environment to be cold.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.640]   Typically people aren't eating in the middle of the night.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.820]   Although one thing that can be useful
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.700]   is to make sure that you're at least well fed enough
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:38.080]   when you head into this third phase of every 24 hour day
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.520]   that you're not awake because you're hungry.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.640]   Now, a lot of people recommend putting a gap
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.000]   between your final bite of food
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.440]   and when you go to sleep at night.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.500]   Some people will say that gap should be four hours.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.340]   Other people say two hours.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.440]   If you're me, I generally have something, I don't know,
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.180]   within two hours or 90 minutes of going to sleep,
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.620]   but it's not a big meal, but that's just me.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.920]   And I fall asleep and stay asleep fine with that.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.460]   You have to experiment for yourself.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.500]   I've talked about supplements that can support sleep
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.120]   in previous episodes of the podcast,
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.480]   things like magnesium threonate or magnesium bisglycinate,
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.960]   things like theanine, apigenin.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.660]   If you'd like to read more about those,
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.960]   we actually have a newsletter
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.420]   that I'll just quickly refer you to.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.620]   This is the Huberman Lab Neural Network newsletter.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.020]   You can sign up for it by going to hubermanlab.com.
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.320]   It's very easy to find.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.360]   But even if you don't sign up,
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:26.400]   you can go to the toolkit for sleep that's listed there.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.200]   And that toolkit is not just supplements.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.960]   That toolkit is a number of different things,
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.800]   both behavioral and supplement-based
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.420]   and nutrition-based, et cetera,
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.100]   that can allow you to get into sleep
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.680]   and to stay asleep more readily.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.820]   It's totally zero cost.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.860]   You can find that again at hubermanlab.com.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.940]   So things like low light, low temperature,
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.300]   the supplements I mentioned,
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.080]   adjusting your eating schedule appropriately,
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.120]   obviously not drinking caffeine in the middle of the night
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.920]   or too close to bed, that's going to be critical.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:55.080]   In fact, ideally you wouldn't ingest any caffeine
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.640]   in phase two of the day
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.800]   so that you could get into this deeper state of rest
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.820]   in which habit formation and neuroplasticity can occur.
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:05.840]   What if you wake up, right?
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.560]   The way I've cast phase three
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.720]   is that you're supposed to be in this deep slumber.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.320]   You're not supposed to wake up at all.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.640]   You're supposed to be in low light
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.840]   and your brain is rewiring
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.720]   and those habits are getting consolidated, et cetera.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.120]   Well, if you're like me,
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.580]   you probably get up once in the middle of the night.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.640]   Maybe you go use the restroom.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.360]   Perfectly normal, perfectly normal.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:25.180]   But a lot of people have trouble falling back asleep.
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:26.900]   Very important if you get up in the middle of the night
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.160]   to use a minimum of light
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.660]   in order to navigate your surroundings,
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:32.900]   just as much as you need in order to safely do so.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.700]   Because light inhibits the hormone melatonin,
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.120]   can make it very hard to fall back asleep
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.840]   if you inhibit melatonin.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.560]   The effects of light inhibiting melatonin
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.180]   are actually very potent, happens very, very quickly.
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.440]   So try and keep the lights low.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.420]   And if you have trouble falling back asleep,
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.240]   that's when you might also want to use
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.120]   something like the Reverie app.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.360]   They have a sleep script there
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.480]   that can hopefully help you get back to sleep
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.880]   or something like NSDR.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.920]   You can find NSDR scripts on YouTube.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.240]   These are zero cost.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.800]   You can look up one that I particularly like
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.320]   is NSDR Made For.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.040]   It's a company I'm associated with,
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.200]   but the NSDR is completely zero cost.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.540]   And there are other things like yoga nidra,
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.300]   which you can find scripts for elsewhere.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.020]   Again, all of these habits or these behaviors,
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:16.220]   these do's and don'ts around phase three themselves
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.560]   might be habits that you're trying to create for yourself.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.820]   But again, phase three is really about making sure
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:24.880]   that whatever limbic friction you've been able to override
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.320]   in phase one and trigger some new habit, right?
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:31.080]   Forcing yourself to write or forcing yourself to study
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.480]   or forcing yourself to exercise
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.120]   during that high limbic friction state.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.160]   And then whatever things you've been doing in phase two,
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.980]   which are habits that hopefully have moved
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:42.120]   a little bit further along the continuum of newly formed
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.100]   versus all the way to reflexive,
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.360]   or things that take less limbic friction in order to do.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.600]   Phase three is when all of that gets really locked
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:52.240]   into the nervous system through those heavy mechanisms
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:55.080]   like NMDA receptors, et cetera, that I talked about before.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:58.720]   Again, neuroplasticity is the basis of habit formation
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.220]   and neuroplasticity and the rewiring of neural circuits
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.800]   happens in these states of deep sleep.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.060]   So if you're not obeying this phase three,
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.040]   if you're not giving phase three the materials it needs
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.780]   and you're not avoiding the certain things like caffeine
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:16.200]   and bright light and stress during phase three,
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.360]   you're simply not going to be able to build those habits
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.960]   that you've been working so hard to trigger in phase one
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.200]   and phase two of the day.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.480]   Again, these are things that I've talked about
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.080]   in previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere,
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.500]   but really this is about habit formation.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.020]   And the whole reason for placing particular types
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.720]   of behaviors at particular phases of the day
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.740]   is to set a framework for that task bracketing.
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.140]   Again, task bracketing and those circuits
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.480]   of the basal ganglia indicate that it's not just
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.320]   the neural circuits that are engaged by the task itself,
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.600]   but the neural circuits that are engaged
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.580]   before and after that task execution.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.620]   That's what gets consolidated.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:03.160]   So when you do things at particular phases of the day
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.920]   under particular conditions of neurochemistry,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.720]   what you're doing is you're giving the brain
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.920]   a very predictable set of sequences that during sleep,
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.120]   it can start to put into your hard drive if you will,
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.560]   it can really program it into your nervous system
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.800]   so that within a short period of time,
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.640]   hopefully within 18 or maybe even six days or who knows,
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.000]   maybe even fewer days, you'll find that executing
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.480]   those behaviors is very, very straightforward for you
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.000]   and that you won't have to feel so much limbic friction
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.120]   or override so much limbic friction.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.720]   Some of you are probably asking, okay,
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.840]   if I perform a particular habit during phase one,
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.960]   and then I do other habits during phase two,
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.700]   and I eventually get to the point where I'm engaging
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.480]   in those habits in a pretty effortless way,
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.560]   do I keep them in the same phase of the day?
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.560]   And the good news is the literature says it doesn't matter.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.220]   And in fact, moving that particular habit
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.240]   around somewhat randomly can actually be beneficial to you
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.320]   because actually moving it from one time a day to the other
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.460]   is that context independence that we really are seeking.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:11.000]   By being able to do the same thing that we want to do,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.900]   regardless of time of day or circumstances,
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.820]   that's how we know that we've achieved
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.160]   a real habit formation.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.800]   That's how we know that the habit has been moved
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.840]   into certain components of our neural circuitry
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.560]   that just allow us to do it what seems like reflexively.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.320]   Although earlier I pointed out that these aren't reflexes
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.400]   in the traditional sense.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.500]   The reason for that is that this brain area,
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.280]   the hippocampus that many of you know
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.940]   is associated with learning and memory
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.320]   is not actually where memories are stored.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.720]   The hippocampus is where memories are formed.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.200]   It's where procedures, like I talked about before,
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.200]   procedural memory of how you're going to execute
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.720]   a particular sequence where that's maintained.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.840]   So like if we use the recipe model, that's where the recipe
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.720]   is maintained until you know how to cook that dish.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.420]   And then the procedural memory literally migrates off
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.220]   into a different set of neural circuits,
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.480]   which are the neural circuits of the neocortex,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.560]   where we have maps of sensory experience,
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.500]   maps of all kinds of experiences,
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.440]   including motor maps of how to execute things.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.980]   So we use one part of the brain to learn something,
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.960]   but then that information in the form
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.600]   of the electrical activity of neurons is passed off
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.080]   to a different brain area.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.000]   Now the neurons themselves don't move
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.440]   from the hippocampus to the cortex.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.280]   That doesn't happen.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.320]   What happens is the signals,
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.040]   the sequence of electrical firing,
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.040]   much like a script for a movie or the notes on a sheet
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.520]   of paper for a particular musical piece is transferred off
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.080]   to a different brain area.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.960]   So that whole process of really leaning
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.080]   into something that's hard, then it becoming easier.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.800]   And then eventually that thing becoming more
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.080]   or less reflexive involves a migration
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.680]   of the information in the brain.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.240]   And once it's migrated out to a different location
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.680]   in the brain, at that point,
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.980]   it's achieved context independence.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:01.360]   It doesn't have to be bracketed by your caffeine
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.200]   and your lunch.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.000]   It doesn't have to occur immediately
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.800]   after your afternoon NSDR,
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.760]   but before your four o'clock meeting on Zoom
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.080]   or something of that sort.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.160]   So all this is to say that once something
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.080]   has become reflexive,
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.160]   you should play with it a little bit about time of day.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.440]   If you want to keep it in the same phase of day, great.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.260]   But if you one day decide you're going to exercise
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.520]   in the afternoon, next day,
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.960]   you decide you're going to exercise in the morning
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.700]   and that's the habit that you're concerned with.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.540]   That's terrific.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:30.620]   If you're able to do that,
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.820]   that means that it's truly achieved context independence.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.400]   It means that you have officially formed that habit.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.480]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.620]   much earlier at the beginning of the episode,
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.200]   the strength of a habit is dictated
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.680]   by how much limbic friction, that was one,
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.640]   and how much context dependence there is.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.300]   So when it doesn't take much activation energy
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.460]   to get into the execution of that habit
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.260]   and you can do it in any context,
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.000]   well, then you have formed a habit.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.420]   We really can't have a discussion
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:02.240]   about learning anything habits or otherwise,
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.480]   unless we talk about reward prediction error.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.780]   Reward prediction error is associated
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.260]   with the molecule dopamine.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.540]   Although I should say there are other neurochemicals
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.140]   in our brain and body that are also related
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:16.020]   to reward prediction error.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:20.520]   But reward prediction error is a very good system,
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.900]   or I should say a lens through which to think about
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.220]   whether or not we should reward ourselves
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.660]   for performing a given habit.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.260]   And this is a much larger discussion
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.320]   that actually relates to things like parenting
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.880]   and self-regulation.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.740]   Should we reward kids just for effort?
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.840]   Should we reward ourselves just for effort?
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.780]   What should we reward?
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:40.140]   How much should we reward ourselves?
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.780]   When should we withdraw reward?
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:42.920]   Should we use punishment?
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.760]   These kinds of things.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.340]   This is a vast literature.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.760]   We don't have time to go into all the details,
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.880]   but the notion of reward prediction error is so powerful
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.860]   that it can predict most, if not all forms of learning,
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:56.580]   including habit formation.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.500]   And you can deploy or use particular features
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.260]   of reward prediction error if you would like to reinforce
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.200]   or accelerate the formation of certain habits.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.880]   So reward prediction error, quite simply,
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   is if you expect a reward and the reward comes,
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.980]   a particular behavior that was associated
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.480]   with generating that reward is more likely to occur again.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.360]   That's pretty straightforward.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.660]   However, the amount of reward
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:29.100]   in the form of this molecule dopamine
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.960]   that you will experience is even greater
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.340]   if a reward arrives that's unexpected, okay?
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.820]   So let me repeat that again.
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:43.540]   If I think that something's coming that's going to be great,
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.220]   that I, let's say I lean into a habit,
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.340]   I managed to override my limbic friction
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:51.260]   and I'm doing my 45 minutes of writing in the morning
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.740]   with no phone and no internet,
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.540]   and I'm getting toward the end and I'm anticipating,
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.060]   oh, I'm actually doing this, this is great.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.460]   I did it, I'm feeling really, really good.
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:03.320]   I finish, I definitely will receive a dopamine reward.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.600]   I'll make my own dopamine reward.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.440]   That's where it comes from.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.500]   Remember, this is all internal.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:11.240]   However, I will also receive dopamine reward
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.640]   if unexpectedly something positive happens.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.040]   And typically if something unexpected but positive happens,
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.120]   the amount of dopamine reward that we get
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.340]   is actually much greater than in any other conditions.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.580]   However, it's hard to surprise yourself
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.140]   about a behavior that you're deliberately engaging in.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.280]   So that becomes a bit of a tricky one.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.460]   Reward prediction error also says that if we expect a reward
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.780]   and the reward doesn't come,
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.580]   that the pattern of dopamine release
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.980]   will follow a particular contour.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.540]   And that contour is very important.
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.180]   Here's how it goes.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:50.140]   Let's say that I'm writing
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:52.700]   and I'm about 30 or 45 minutes in
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.780]   and I'm thinking, oh, this is great.
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.320]   I'm actually, I managed to do this.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:59.420]   I'm succeeding in executing the behaviors that I need to
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:01.740]   in order to perform this habit.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.420]   I'm overriding limbic friction.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.080]   Just that series of thoughts will start to generate
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.700]   a dopamine release within my brain and body.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.680]   However, if at the 50-minute mark,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.260]   the phone rings and I pick up the phone
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:18.680]   or I break my own protocol,
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.380]   I break my own self-discipline
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.620]   and I go on and check social media
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:25.280]   or I do something that takes me out of that,
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.640]   what's going to happen is that my level of dopamine
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.820]   is actually going to drop below the baseline,
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:34.040]   meaning below the level of dopamine I had
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.220]   before I even started the habit execution, okay?
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.020]   So what this is, is this is a system
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.660]   that predicts whether or not rewards are going to come.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.560]   When we think a reward is going to come,
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.660]   it starts to actually arrive earlier
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.020]   in the form of dopamine release.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.660]   This is the feeling that we experience
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:55.020]   as in positive anticipation.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.540]   You tell a kid, hey, we're going to go to the amusement park
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.020]   or we're going to go get ice cream.
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:00.300]   They haven't had the ice cream yet.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.280]   They're not at the amusement park, but they're excited.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.840]   The dopamine release comes earlier, okay?
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.020]   They get to the amusement park or they get the ice cream,
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.360]   they will also have some dopamine release
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.820]   associated with that.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.500]   But most of it, believe it or not,
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.420]   came in the form of the anticipation.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.460]   And dopamine has some qualities that make
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.660]   the actual ice cream and the actual amusement park experience
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.740]   more pleasureful than it would be
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.020]   had that dopamine release not happened.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.080]   Now, of course, the other way to do it is to surprise a kid.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:29.240]   You tell them, listen, we're going to the class
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.280]   that you absolutely hate,
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.820]   or we're going to go see the person
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.140]   that you absolutely despise,
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.520]   and then you drive them to the amusement park.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.080]   That's the big release of dopamine.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.360]   But reward prediction error also says
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.740]   that if you tell the kid or yourself,
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.100]   okay, we're headed to the amusement park,
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.300]   we're going to get some ice cream,
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.300]   they're really, really excited,
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.540]   and then you get there and it's closed
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.340]   or they're not letting any more people in,
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.380]   well, then the dopamine level drops way below what it was
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.500]   before you told them that you were headed there, okay?
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.820]   I've given a number of different examples
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.160]   that hopefully make this clear.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.420]   Reward prediction error governs virtually all aspects
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.820]   of effort and all aspects of learning, why?
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.660]   Because when dopamine is released in the brain and body,
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.440]   the neural circuits of our brain and body change.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.140]   There's a state change, our overlevel, excuse me,
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.420]   our overall level of energy,
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.580]   but also the sorts of sensory events
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.500]   that we're paying attention to changes
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.420]   when there's a lot of dopamine in our system.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.800]   Now, you can leverage this for habit formation.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.460]   Think back to task bracketing.
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:32.100]   Think back to limbic friction.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.260]   If you are considering adopting a new habit
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:37.040]   or if you are trying to break a habit,
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.460]   something we haven't talked too much about,
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.660]   but we will in a moment,
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.380]   it's very useful to think not just about the procedural
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:46.300]   aspects of what you're going to do,
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.920]   but also think about the events that precede and follow
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.580]   that particular habit and the execution,
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.740]   or at least the effort to execute that habit.
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.620]   What you're doing is you're casting a kind of a spotlight
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.840]   around a bin of time or a set of events
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.020]   for which dopamine can be associated.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.100]   What does this look like in the practical sense?
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.540]   Well, again, I'll just try and use
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.060]   very simple concrete examples,
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.720]   but this could carry over to anything.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.880]   Let's say I were somebody who has a hard time
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.300]   getting in that 30 to 60 minutes
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.620]   of zone two cardiovascular exercise mid morning.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.940]   This is actually an issue for me.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.800]   I much prefer to do resistance exercise
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.040]   than cardiovascular exercise.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:26.880]   Although once I do it,
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.660]   I always feel much better that I have done it.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:36.860]   What I should do is positively anticipate the onset
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.860]   and the offset of that session, right?
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.740]   So thinking about leaning into the effort,
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.280]   going out and doing that zone two cardio session,
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.360]   and I should think about how I'm going to feel after.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.800]   So not just thinking about how great I'm going to feel after,
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.400]   but also thinking about how hard it's going to be
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.000]   at the beginning, and then trying to reward myself
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.060]   subjectively for the entire experience.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.820]   In other words, start rewarding task bracketing
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:06.540]   in addition to rewarding the execution of the habit itself.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.600]   Now, some of you might be saying,
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.220]   well, wait, this is all self-talk.
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:10.700]   This is just positive self-talk,
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.620]   but it's not positive self-talk.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.340]   It's not saying, you know,
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.620]   I feel so great about doing something that I actually hate.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.580]   You can't lie to yourself,
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.060]   or you're welcome to lie to yourself,
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.600]   but the neuroscience literature,
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.100]   the literature of growth mindset,
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.060]   all the literature basically of mindset
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.160]   speaks to the fact that when you lie to yourself,
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.240]   you know you're lying,
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.380]   and you actually set up the opposite of a reward system.
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.020]   So you have to be brutally honest with yourself
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.380]   that for instance,
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.200]   I don't like initiating this cardiovascular exercise,
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.820]   but I do like the fact that I've done it after I've done it.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:40.880]   So what you are doing
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.620]   is you are applying reward prediction error
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.420]   to the entire sequence of things
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.160]   that's involved in getting into the habit execution,
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.040]   getting through the habit execution,
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.120]   and getting out of the habit execution.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.160]   How do you do this?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.080]   Well, I take us back to our procedural
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.320]   memory visualization exercise that we talked about earlier.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.060]   When I talked about it in that context,
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.880]   I talked about walking through mentally
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.920]   the series of steps that's required
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.140]   to perform a particular habit.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.140]   So in the case of the zone two cardio thing,
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.600]   it would be, okay, I'm going to put on my shoes.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.620]   Then I'm going to head out the door.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.860]   Then I'm going to drive up the road.
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.200]   There's a particular canyon near here
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.460]   that if I'm going to run,
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.700]   I happen to like running,
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.540]   or I don't hate running enough that I tend to do it.
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.300]   Going through that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:24.380]   That's great,
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:27.780]   but even better would be to broaden the time bin
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.020]   and start to positively anticipate
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.300]   the period headed into the habit.
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.040]   So even before you put on your shoes,
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.140]   the fact that you are successfully placing the habit in,
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.180]   in this case, phase one of the day,
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.860]   and that afterwards I'm going to feel
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.920]   a particular set of positive benefits,
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.380]   elevated mood, et cetera.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.380]   I like being hungry.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.980]   And typically after exercise, I'm hungry.
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.700]   So I like being hungry 'cause I like eating.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.280]   And so there's a whole set of things
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.860]   that link up with one another.
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.580]   So I'm not just thinking about habit execution
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.660]   as this isolated little set of events
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.260]   or this little time bin,
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:04.160]   but rather I'm drawing a larger envelope around it
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.660]   and starting to positively associate dopamine reward
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.660]   with that larger envelope.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.900]   And for those of you that are thinking,
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.460]   well, this is just a psychological trick.
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.460]   This is sort of like lying to yourself.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.620]   It's not, because you're not actually contradicting
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.780]   the fact that some of this is unpleasant.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.020]   What you're doing is you're taking
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.360]   this entire series of events,
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.980]   what I'm calling this kind of time envelope,
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.580]   and you're associating it with a particular reward
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.940]   that comes later, which for me would be the feeling
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:31.400]   that I've completed this, right?
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.240]   'Cause for me, that's usually a good feeling.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.600]   So reward prediction error is beautiful,
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.000]   not just because it's a sort of math of anticipation
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.400]   and reward or a math of anticipation and disappointment.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.420]   It's beautiful because you can stretch out
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:47.640]   or make more narrow the time bins
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.100]   in which reward prediction error works.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:51.680]   Reward prediction error is the way
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:54.600]   in which people navigate four-year degrees, right?
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.640]   I mean, you go, sure, final exam to final exam, et cetera,
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.520]   but ultimately there's a big payoff at the end
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.400]   and it's all basically for that big payoff.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.120]   And of course I understand that it's the journey,
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.600]   not the destination, but let's face it for a lot of us,
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.680]   goals and habits are about achieving
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.260]   some sort of destination.
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.840]   In the case of zone two cardio, for me,
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.160]   it's about trying to stay alive for as long as I can,
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.600]   as long as I can with vitality that is.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.120]   And it's also the fact that if I'm doing that,
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.600]   I get to eat the foods that I like,
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.920]   I tend to be able to eat more,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.800]   which I happen to really enjoy eating so much so
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.640]   that I'd like it just as an activity.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.500]   So basically what you're trying to do
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.280]   is not restrict your thinking to just the habit
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.460]   that you're trying to form,
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.160]   but rather to grab a hold of the timing
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.840]   before and after that particular habit
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.540]   and start to positively associate reward mechanisms
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.040]   in your brain with that entire time bin.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.680]   This is a very useful and very powerful tool
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.340]   in order to form habits.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.520]   And I should say that it's not something
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.040]   that comes naturally to most people.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.520]   In fact, even as I describe it,
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.540]   you might find it's still a little bit abstract,
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:57.060]   but what I encourage you to do
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.320]   if you are finding it to be a little bit vague
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.080]   would be to pick the habit that you want to form,
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.560]   write down or think about very concretely
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.260]   what is the sequence of steps involved
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:08.200]   in the execution of that habit,
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.200]   and then write down or think about
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.620]   what is the sequence of events
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.500]   that need to precede that habit,
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.100]   maybe the immediate 10 or 15 minutes before,
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:18.240]   as well as the immediate sequence of events
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.280]   and or feelings that will occur after that habit,
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.860]   and then call the whole thing a habit execution,
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:29.080]   the whole thing a effort to engage in that particular habit.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.060]   And in doing that and in positively associating
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.940]   with the idea that you're going to complete
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.440]   that entire sequence,
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.520]   you will engage reward prediction error
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.140]   in the proper way that the dopamine surge
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.900]   can lend itself toward motivation,
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:45.480]   because ultimately dopamine is not about feeling good,
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.960]   it's about feeling motivated.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.400]   This is something that I've talked about
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.400]   numerous times before,
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.780]   but dopamine, contrary to popular belief,
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:55.200]   is not a reward molecule as much as it is a molecule
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.340]   of motivation and drive.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:00.420]   And the natural consequence of doing the exercise
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.540]   I just described of writing things out that precede,
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.660]   are involved in the immediate execution of the habit
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.220]   and follow the habit,
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:11.080]   will allow you to experience an increase in energy
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.460]   and thereby an increase in likelihood
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.500]   that you're going to engage
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.460]   in that entire sequence of events.
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.820]   And the reason for that is that dopamine gives us energy.
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:22.160]   And the reason for that is that the molecule epinephrine,
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.860]   adrenaline, is actually manufactured from dopamine.
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.060]   Biochemically, it comes from dopamine.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:31.140]   So dopamine is powerful and you can access more dopamine
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.460]   around even habits that you haven't yet formed
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.420]   by taking this broader time envelope
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.660]   and task bracketing that specific task execution
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.300]   or habit execution.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.140]   Way back at the beginning of the episode,
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.100]   I promised you that I would deliver two programs
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.320]   that are geared towards habit formation.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.340]   And I promised that I would give you ways
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.620]   in which you could gauge whether or not certain habits
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:56.980]   had moved from high effort,
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:00.180]   what I call high limbic friction, to reflexive.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.940]   We talked about a number of ways to gauge that.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.540]   In researching this episode,
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:07.480]   I found a tremendous number of different systems
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.500]   for habit formation.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.420]   It's really amazing how much is out there.
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.220]   There are ones that are 60 days to this,
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.580]   or 21 days to that, or 18 days to this.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.320]   I mean, it's just rampant
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.180]   in the popular psychology literature
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:19.780]   and in the self-help literature.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:23.420]   I want to spell out a particular system
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.100]   that I think could be very useful
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.520]   to most if not all people
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:31.100]   that's rooted in the biology of habit formation,
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.180]   rooted in the psychology of habit formation,
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.860]   and that is entirely compatible
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.380]   with that phase one, phase two, phase three type program
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:38.980]   that I talked about earlier,
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:42.180]   but encompasses a bit of a longer time scale
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:46.540]   and really arrives at a kind of a system, if you will,
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.780]   for how to build in habits
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.060]   and then to test whether or not those habits
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.420]   have really stuck
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.140]   and whether or not they're likely to stick going forward.
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.440]   And so this is at least for sake of this example,
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.660]   a 21-day system.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.700]   I picked 21 days because that seems to be the average
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:06.900]   or most typical system for engaging neuroplasticity
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.900]   as it relates to the formation of new habits.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.620]   This 21-day system actually is one
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.340]   that someone I know very well uses
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.960]   and has used for a long time.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.180]   They actually use them, their kids use it as well,
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.220]   and it has a certain elegance to it.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.760]   And I think as I describe it,
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.480]   that elegance will begin to reveal itself.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.160]   So basically what this involves is you set out
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.620]   to perform six new habits per day
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.760]   across the course of 21 days.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.640]   Why six and why 21?
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.100]   Well, we'll talk about that in a moment,
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.080]   but the idea is you write down six things
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.180]   that you would like to do every day for 21 days.
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:44.280]   What phase of the day those things fall into?
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.800]   Well, that will depend on what they are
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.800]   and how they relate to those earlier phase one,
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.840]   phase two, phase three.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.720]   But for now, 21 days, six things per day.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:55.640]   However, the expectation is that you'll only complete
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.520]   four to five of those each day, okay?
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.560]   So built into this is a kind of permission to fail,
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.680]   but it's not failure because it turns out
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.760]   that this approach to forming habits
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.760]   is based not so much on the specific habits
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.240]   that you're trying to form,
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.240]   but the habit of performing habits, right?
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.800]   It's the habit of doing a certain number of things
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.140]   per day.
[01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.740]   So you set out to perform six.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:24.700]   Now, another reason for not necessarily performing all six
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.560]   is that some activities probably shouldn't be
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.440]   performed each day.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.640]   For instance, in my case, if I were to weight train
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:34.120]   or even run every day, I'm of the sort,
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.540]   or my biology is of the sort that I don't recover so well.
[01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:40.160]   So I wouldn't want to do resistance training every day,
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.840]   but I might want to do it four days a week, for instance.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.560]   So by having six things in that list,
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.280]   I could shuffle out that particular activity
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.560]   on particular days of the week.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.280]   And simply do four or five other activities.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.260]   So 21 days, you list out four to five things.
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:55.640]   So it might be zone two cardio resistance training,
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:21:00.160]   sunlight viewing, writing, it could be journaling.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.560]   It could be learning a language, mathematics.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.960]   Again, this is going to vary depending
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.780]   on your particular goals and the habits
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.420]   that you're trying to create.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.020]   But no more than six.
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:11.120]   And the expectation is that you're not going to perform
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.260]   more than four to five.
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:16.020]   If you miss a day, meaning you don't perform
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.560]   four to five things, there is no punishment.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.180]   And in fact, it's important that you don't actually try
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.760]   and do what in the literature is called
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.460]   a habit slip compensation,
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:29.080]   which is just fancy psychological language
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:33.340]   for if you screw up and you don't get all four or five
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.900]   in one day, you don't do eight the next day
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:37.720]   in order to compensate.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:39.700]   This actually brings me back to an example
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:40.900]   I had from graduate school.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:42.380]   I remember when I started graduate school,
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:45.460]   feeling very excited, but a little bit overwhelmed
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.240]   by the amount of things that I had to do
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.400]   because I had to both do research.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.520]   I was doing coursework at the time,
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.940]   graduate student stipends, and still now, unfortunately,
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:55.300]   were depressingly low.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.600]   So it was financially stressful.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.000]   There were a number of things happening.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.640]   And I remember a neurologist, this was at UC Berkeley,
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.560]   it's really fantastic scientist and person.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.400]   His name is Bob Knight.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.840]   Some of you may know him.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.640]   I remember I went to him and I asked him,
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.320]   what is the process by which someone actually navigates
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.620]   graduate school successfully?
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:16.000]   And he said, listen, you don't want to do anything
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.640]   or engage in a routine in any way
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.200]   that you can't keep up consistently for at least five
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.120]   and ideally six days per week.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.240]   I thought, oh, that's pretty good.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.000]   And he said, every four or five years,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.040]   you might have to update that,
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.200]   but you need to decide what you can do consistently,
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.980]   what you can do every day or at least six days a week
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.040]   or five days a week.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.080]   And that was very, very useful to me.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.880]   And it fits well with this notion of habit slips,
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.000]   that if you happen to screw up
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.360]   and not be able to engage in whatever habits
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.800]   you're trying to learn for whatever reason,
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.960]   that the next day you just get right back on the horse,
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.240]   so to speak.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.760]   However, there's a really interesting feature
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.620]   from the neuroscience literature
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.940]   and from the psychology literature that says that
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:58.940]   chunking this 21 days into two day bins
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.880]   can be very, very useful.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:04.600]   While it is true that the unit of the day that our cells use
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.540]   is a circadian one, a 24 hour clock,
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.180]   there does seem to be something powerful
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.080]   about engaging in particular habits
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:15.180]   in a particular sequence for two days in a row
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.160]   and then resetting.
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.760]   So thinking, okay, I can do this for a day.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.680]   And if I can do it for a day,
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.740]   I can probably do it for two days and then resetting.
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:23.720]   So every two days you're resetting.
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.200]   So you're kind of chunking this 21 days
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.980]   into a series of two day bins
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:31.280]   in which you are trying to perform four to five new habits
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.820]   and then completing that 21 days.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.120]   Now, everything I've described about this 21 day program
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.680]   with six things that you're trying to do as new habits
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.320]   and only performing four to five
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.120]   and not compensating, et cetera.
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.660]   There's nothing neuroscientifically unique about it,
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:50.140]   except for the fact that it's not just 21 days
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.380]   broken up into two day chunks.
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:57.380]   After 21 days, you stop engaging in this 21 day
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:24:01.440]   deliberate four to five things per day type schedule.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.080]   And you simply go into autopilot.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.560]   You ask yourself how many of those particular habits
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.000]   that I was deliberately trying to learn
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.040]   in the previous 21 days
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.420]   are automatically incorporated into my schedule.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.680]   How many of them am I naturally doing?
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.480]   In other words, every 21 days,
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:21.080]   you don't update and start adding new habits.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.880]   You simply try and maintain the ones
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.000]   that you built in that first 21 days.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.180]   And this I think is extremely important
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.720]   because in all of the habit literature that I could find,
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.280]   sure, there was a lot of psychological data,
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.280]   neuroscience data, behavioral science data around,
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.420]   here's how you form a habit.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:38.920]   Here's how you break a habit.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.180]   There was even some kind of tests
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:42.220]   for whether or not a habit
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:45.080]   had really achieved context independence,
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.840]   whether or not it was a strongly formed habit.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.760]   But there wasn't a lot of information,
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.700]   at least by my search,
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.000]   of what to do once you've formed a habit
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.680]   and how to evaluate whether or not that habit
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.900]   is likely to persist long into the future.
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.600]   So here's the idea.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.680]   You set out these six things that you would like to learn
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.680]   or that you would like to acquire in your life,
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.780]   these habits.
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:10.540]   You only expect that you're going to perform
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.700]   four or five each day.
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.340]   You do that for 21 days.
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.480]   Again, if you miss a day,
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.000]   you just hop right back on the next day.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.980]   However, you should think about the functional units
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:22.240]   within this 21 day period as two days.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.760]   You're going to try and nail four to five of these things
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:25.600]   for two days.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.940]   If you happen to get all six, great,
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:29.120]   but that's not necessarily required.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.060]   So you can do two days, then reset two days,
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.000]   then reset two days.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.780]   And then in the next 21 days,
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.780]   you're not trying to acquire any new habits.
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:38.000]   You're not going to throw in six more habits
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:38.960]   that you want to learn.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.200]   You're simply going to assess how well,
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.820]   how deeply you've rewired your nervous system
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:46.680]   to be able to perform those six habits
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.660]   of the previous 21 days.
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:50.720]   And this is extremely useful, I believe,
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.060]   because it will allow you to assess whether or not
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.740]   you can indeed make room, if you even have room,
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.940]   I should say, for more habits, right?
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.340]   Many people are trying to cram so many new behaviors
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.720]   into their nervous system that they don't stand a chance
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.140]   of learning all those behaviors.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.280]   What you may find is that you kept up two of those things
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.300]   very consistently throughout the 21 days.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:14.020]   And perhaps there was one of them that you did sporadically
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:17.300]   and that there were three others that, frankly,
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.280]   you didn't manage to execute.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.240]   You may also be one of these people, one of these mutants,
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.100]   that sets out to do six new things per day for 21 days
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.880]   and performs every single one of them.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.380]   Terrific, more power to you.
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:31.420]   In that case, for the following 21 days,
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:33.420]   let's see whether or not you can continue to perform
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:36.680]   those very same six things every day for 21 days.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.980]   And then, and only then,
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:41.160]   would you want to add more habits in.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.540]   So you could repeat this 21 day process,
[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:46.860]   21 days of new habit, 21 days of testing those new habits
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:48.260]   as whether or not they're reflexive or not.
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:51.340]   You could do that forever if you wanted.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.880]   But the idea is that this isn't something
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.620]   that you're doing all year long.
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:56.820]   It's that you perhaps starting the new year
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.740]   or regardless of when you're listening to this,
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.500]   you set out to make that 21 day,
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.260]   really the stimulus period in which the habits get wired in.
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:05.460]   And then the following month,
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.340]   and maybe even the following months or periods of 21 days,
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:12.100]   are really that kind of thermometer or the test bed
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:15.540]   of how well you've embedded those particular habits.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:18.560]   And if indeed you want to continue to add new habits
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.500]   or you find that certain habits that you weren't able
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.780]   to embed in your nervous system and make reflexive,
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.100]   you want to then bring those in, fantastic.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.620]   But it's only once you've achieved all those six habits
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.420]   as reflexive that you would move forward.
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:31.780]   And I think this sort of system,
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:33.720]   while it could have been replaced
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.700]   with many other different systems,
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.880]   again, there's nothing holy about the system,
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.740]   but this particular system has a number of features,
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:43.340]   the lack of compensation for missed days,
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:46.060]   the fact that it's a fairly high intensity program
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.500]   for 21 days, but then you test yourself
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.940]   a kind of a competition test with yourself, if you will.
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:55.100]   Those features and the fact that habits slips,
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.740]   missing of particular habits and not doing all six
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.000]   is kind of built into the system,
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.220]   I think makes it a very reasonable one.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.980]   It's very adaptable to the real world.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:08.420]   And I think it's one that provided you obey the phase one,
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.060]   phase two, phase three type system
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:10.980]   that we talked about earlier,
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:13.440]   you collapse these two programs with one another,
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.640]   which hopefully will be easy
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.420]   based on the descriptions I've given.
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:17.260]   Well, if you do that,
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:19.720]   and I think there's a very high probability
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.140]   that the habits that you try and form
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.740]   will achieve this context dependence
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.140]   and that it will take progressively
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:26.460]   less and less limbic friction to perform them.
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.920]   Thus far, we've almost exclusively been discussing
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.360]   how to form habits, but what about breaking habits?
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.440]   Certainly many people out there would like to break habits
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.100]   that they feel don't serve them well.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:39.840]   One of the challenges in breaking habits
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.160]   is that many habits occur very, very quickly.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.760]   And so there isn't an opportunity to intervene
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.120]   until the habit has already been initiated
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.480]   and in some cases completed.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.240]   Well, there are a couple of tools
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.520]   that neuroscience and psychology
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.580]   tell us can be very beneficial.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:59.380]   Some of those things are somewhat intuitive
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:02.220]   and relate to what I call foundational practices,
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.540]   meaning things that set the overall tone
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.020]   in your body and brain,
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:08.100]   such that you would be less likely
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.200]   to engage in a particular habit,
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.100]   or that would raise your level of awareness,
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.540]   both of your situation and to how you feel inside.
[01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.380]   So things like stress reduction,
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:19.700]   things like getting good sleep,
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.180]   things like quality nutrition,
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.300]   things like having positive routines
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:24.760]   arranged throughout your day.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.380]   All of those, of course, will support you
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:29.720]   in trying to break particular habits.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.320]   And while that can be very useful,
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.120]   it's admittedly very generic advice.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.740]   It doesn't point to any one specific protocol.
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:39.760]   In order to identify a specific protocol
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.220]   that one could apply in order to break habits,
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.620]   we have to look at the mirror image
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:47.060]   of the sort of neuroplasticity that we talked about
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:49.000]   at the beginning of the episode.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   At the beginning of the episode,
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.700]   we talked about a form of neuroplasticity
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:56.140]   called long-term potentiation involving the NMDA receptor.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:57.780]   Just to refresh your memory a little bit,
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:00.540]   it basically says that if a set of neurons
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:01.960]   is very electrically active,
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.520]   it's likely that over time,
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.820]   those neurons will communicate with themselves more easily
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:10.300]   because of changes in things like NMDA receptor activity,
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:12.700]   the recruitment of additional receptors, et cetera.
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:15.360]   It's essentially a cellular and molecular explanation
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:19.660]   for how something goes from unlearned to learned
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:20.940]   to reflexive.
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:23.560]   Now, in order to break synapses
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.620]   or to break apart neural connections
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.860]   that are serving a habit that you don't want to engage in,
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:32.520]   we need to engage the process called long-term depression.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.260]   And long-term depression has nothing to do
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:39.900]   with a state of mental depression or a reduction in mood.
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.380]   So I really want to be clear
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:43.860]   that when I say depression in this context,
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:46.220]   it has nothing to do with psychological depression.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.900]   It has nothing to do with mood.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:50.180]   It's simply called long-term depression
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:52.940]   because just as long-term potentiation says,
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.840]   if neuron A triggers the firing of neuron B,
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:59.020]   and it does so very robustly over and over and over again,
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.780]   then neuron A will not have to fire
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:03.780]   as intensely or as frequently
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:06.740]   in order to activate neuron B in the future
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.740]   because they become potentiated, right?
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:11.700]   The threshold for coactivation has been reduced.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.980]   There's a much higher probability
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.660]   that they will be activated together
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.980]   at low levels of intensity.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.520]   That's essentially what long-term potentiation is.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:23.260]   Long-term depression says that if neuron A is active
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:28.200]   and neuron B is not active within a particular time window,
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.580]   then the connection between neuron A and B
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:32.000]   will weaken over time,
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.700]   even if they started off very strongly connected, okay?
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:36.700]   So I'm going to repeat that
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:41.180]   because this is a pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:45.100]   whereby if neuron A is active and neuron B is active,
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:48.200]   but at a different time or outside of particular,
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:49.500]   what we call temporal window,
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.020]   meaning outside a particular time window,
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.340]   then through long-term depression,
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:58.220]   the connection between neuron A and neuron B will weaken.
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:01.020]   And just as a point of interest,
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:04.340]   the NMDA receptor is also involved in long-term depression,
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:06.540]   although there are other molecular components
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:07.660]   involved as well.
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.980]   So how do you take two neurons
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.240]   that underlie a habit out of synchrony?
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.700]   How do you get them to fire asynchronously?
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.200]   This is pretty interesting
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.080]   with respect to the cellular molecular biology,
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.940]   but at the behavioral level, it's especially interesting.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.300]   The way that one would do this is let's say, for instance,
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:29.300]   you have a habit of picking up your phone mid-work session.
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:31.540]   Okay, that's a reflexive habit
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:34.520]   I think that most people have experienced.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.220]   And we often hear the idea that, oh, you know,
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.980]   the phone is so filled with access to dopamine
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:42.580]   and incredible things that we're just drawn to it.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:46.300]   But if you notice what's happened with phone use over time,
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.980]   most people, including myself sometimes, I admit,
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.800]   find ourselves just looking at our phone
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.680]   or find ourselves in a particular app
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:55.020]   without actually having engaged in the conscious set
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.620]   of steps of, oh, I'm really curious
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:58.240]   what's going on in this particular app.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.000]   I'm really curious what's going on
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.160]   in this particular website.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.900]   And you just kind of find yourself, in air quotes,
[01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:06.540]   for those of you listening, I'm making air quotes,
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.140]   you just sort of find yourself doing it
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.860]   because the behavior of picking up your phone
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:13.120]   is sort of reflexive or has become fully reflexive.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.460]   You see this a lot at meals where multiple people are there
[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:17.860]   and no one's looking at their phone.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:19.400]   And then all of a sudden someone takes out their phone
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.540]   and you'll notice that other people
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:22.060]   just naturally take out their phone.
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:26.360]   It's this kind of observed, observation-induced reflex.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.500]   And I would wager that most people aren't consciously aware
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:33.560]   of the immediate steps involved.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:36.020]   So the literature says there are a number of ways
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:39.000]   to break these sorts of habitual behaviors
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.980]   or reflexive behaviors.
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:44.260]   Most of those approaches involve establishing
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.040]   some sort of reward for not performing the activity
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:50.920]   or some sort of punishment for forming the activity.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.080]   I've heard of some basic things that people will do,
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.980]   like they'll even put like a rubber band on their wrist
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:56.420]   and every time they complain
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:58.880]   or every time they do some behavior,
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:33:59.920]   like pick up their phone,
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.840]   they'll give themselves a snap on the wrist.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.280]   The rationale there is that you're trying to create
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:08.480]   a somatic, a very physical representation of something
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.180]   that makes it very real and harder to overlook.
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:13.460]   Other people will just do a tick mark on a piece of paper,
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:15.620]   the sort of what gets measured
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:18.180]   is what gets managed kind of mindset,
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.160]   where if every time you do something,
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.700]   you take away the judgment,
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.280]   this is very new agey, I realize,
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.980]   but this is what you find out there
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.040]   if you search the literature,
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.840]   even on PubMed, peer-reviewed articles,
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.740]   that every time you engage in a behavior,
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:34.920]   you just measure the fact that you did that behavior.
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.720]   You just mark it down at the end of the day.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.840]   People are supposed to look at that and say,
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.380]   "Oh my goodness, I can't believe that I spent,
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:42.600]   you know, three hours doing something
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.360]   or I did it 46 times."
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.640]   And in fact, a lot of apps, social media apps,
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.420]   will start to give you warnings now if you opt in
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.840]   that you've been on the app for an hour,
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:52.680]   would you like to leave?
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.600]   Most people just click right past it and go back in.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.800]   I think very few people say,
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.220]   "Oh my goodness, it's been an hour,"
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.360]   and therefore you're right,
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.520]   I absolutely shouldn't engage in this anymore.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.740]   It's just far too easy to just blow past those reminders.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:08.560]   Well, the literature on habit formation
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.580]   and habit reduction, breaking habits, has been analyzed.
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:15.320]   There's a beautiful meta-analysis,
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:17.500]   which involves looking at a number of different studies
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:21.220]   all together, comparing the statistical strength
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.220]   of each of those studies, looking in different conditions,
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:26.760]   what sorts of habits we're trying to be made or broken.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:31.060]   The first author on this review is Fritz, F-R-I-T-Z.
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:33.280]   I'll certainly put a link to this.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.560]   It's Heather Fritz and it's "Intervention to Modify Habits,"
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.100]   a scoping review, and it is indeed a very broad scale review.
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.340]   It's from the Journal of Occupation,
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:41.480]   Participation, and Health.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.760]   It's published in 2020.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.400]   It's a really nice article.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.020]   A couple of things I learned from this article,
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:47.460]   and then I'll get into the specific tool
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:48.720]   for breaking habits.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.060]   Perhaps the most interesting thing
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:52.580]   that I took from this review was the finding
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:57.160]   that notifications to either engage in habits
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.800]   or to not engage in habits
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:01.600]   actually were not very effective over time.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.960]   They were effective in the immediate period
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.960]   when people started using these notifications,
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.440]   as were little sticky notes,
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.180]   like don't go into the refrigerator
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.300]   between the hours of whatever and whatever,
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.940]   or just visual reminders,
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:16.780]   physical reminders or electronic reminders
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:18.340]   were effective in the immediate term,
[01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:20.020]   but in the longterm did not predict
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.880]   whether or not people would effectively stick to habits
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.820]   they were trying to stick to
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:25.940]   or break habits that they were trying to break.
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:28.960]   So sadly, that doesn't seem to work very well,
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.120]   and perhaps they just need to come up with
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.540]   more robust reminders on a mild electric shock
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:35.380]   or something like that,
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.160]   because what we do know,
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.620]   only sort of kidding about mild electric shock,
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.240]   but what we do know from both human and animal studies
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.800]   is that things like electric shock,
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.600]   things like monetary penalties, right?
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.320]   Having to pay out every time you engage
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.480]   in a particular behavior,
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.260]   those are pretty effective ways to break habits.
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:56.360]   The problem is when people are not being monitored
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.480]   for habit use, for instance,
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.300]   you can imagine a situation where you say,
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:02.560]   I'm not going to pick up my phone
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:04.920]   for the four hours in the early part of the day
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.740]   so that I can get real dedicated focus work done.
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.000]   Unless someone's monitoring them,
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.760]   then people don't tend to monitor themselves
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.560]   completely enough that they punish themselves
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.080]   completely enough that they break the behavior.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.480]   In other words, the punishment isn't bad enough
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:20.520]   in order to break the habit,
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:23.760]   which just speaks to how powerful these habits are
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:24.920]   once they become reflexive.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.980]   They're just very, very hard to override.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.640]   So it turns out that the key
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.460]   to generating long-term depression in these pathways
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:37.460]   is actually to take the period immediately following
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.620]   the bad habit execution,
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.840]   meaning let's say you tell yourself,
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:41.880]   you're not going to pick up your phone,
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.840]   you're not going to bite your nails,
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.000]   you're not going to reflexively walk to the refrigerator
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.260]   at a particular time of day,
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.440]   but you find yourself doing it anyway.
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.480]   And what actually has to happen
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.720]   is bringing conscious awareness
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.360]   to the period immediately afterward,
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.820]   which I think most people recognize.
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:57.540]   They realize, oh, I just did it again.
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.480]   I just did it again.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.000]   And in that moment, capture the sequence of events,
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.680]   not that led to the bad habit execution,
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:08.260]   but actually to take advantage of the fact
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:09.920]   that the neurons that were responsible
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.280]   for generating that bad habit were active a moment ago,
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:17.680]   and to actually engage in a replacement behavior
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.400]   immediately afterward.
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.500]   Now, this is really interesting and I think powerful
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:22.720]   because I would have thought
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.880]   that you have to engage in a replacement behavior
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:29.600]   that truly replaces the bad habit behavior, right?
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.020]   That you would have to be able to identify
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:34.040]   your state of mind or the sequence of events
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.760]   leading into the bad habit,
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.280]   but rather the stage or the period
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.320]   immediately after the bad habit execution
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:43.760]   is a unique opportunity to insert a different type
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.720]   of what we would call adaptive behavior,
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.920]   but that could be any behavior
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.600]   that's not in line with the bad behavior.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:51.800]   So let's give it an example.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.560]   Let's say you find yourself,
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.180]   you're trying to do focused work, you pick up your phone,
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:59.560]   you're disappointing yourself for picking up your phone.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.760]   You could of course just put it down
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.220]   and re-engage in the work behavior.
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:05.440]   But if you were good at that,
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.560]   then you probably wouldn't have done it in the first place.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.920]   And so what turns out to be very effective
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.920]   is to go engage in some other positive habit.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.960]   Now, this has two major effects.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:17.640]   The first one is you start to link in time
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.500]   the execution of a bad behavior
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.960]   to this other good behavior.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:26.400]   And in doing so, you start to recruit other neural circuits,
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.500]   other neurons that can start to somewhat dismantle
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:33.580]   the sequence of firing associated with the bad behavior.
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:35.520]   In other words, you start to create
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.440]   a kind of a double habit that starts with a bad habit
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.320]   and then ends with a good habit.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:44.260]   And that seems to create enough of a temporal mismatch
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.000]   so that then recognizing
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.880]   when you're heading toward the bad habit
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.120]   becomes more apparent to you.
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:52.180]   So again, I want to make this very, very concrete.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:53.700]   Let's say that the behavior
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.940]   is reflexively picking up one's phone.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.540]   You do that, you think, "Oh goodness, I did it again."
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:39:59.620]   Here's what I'm going to do.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.780]   You would set that down
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:04.080]   and then you would engage in some other positive behavior
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.240]   that you've deemed positive.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.500]   And here it's very subjective.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.860]   So it's hard for me to give an example
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.500]   that will necessarily make sense to everybody.
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.680]   But perhaps you're working on hydration.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.320]   So maybe you go have a glass of water.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:18.900]   Maybe you are trying to do breath work or something.
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:20.320]   Maybe you are trying
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.100]   to enhance your language speaking skills.
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:24.880]   And so you go and you spend five minutes
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.040]   doing a particular type of language learning.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.240]   You literally exit whatever you are doing
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.940]   and perform that other new positive habit
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.720]   in the immediate period right after that,
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.500]   even for a short period of time.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.160]   It's a little bit counterintuitive,
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.900]   but what this does is it creates a kind of a cognitive
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:45.020]   and a temporal mismatch between the initial bad behavior,
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:47.980]   which before is what we would call sort of a closed loop.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:50.540]   And the engineers out there will know what I'm talking about.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:53.620]   But in closed loop, it's one behavior,
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:55.420]   one set of neural firings leads to another,
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:56.260]   leads to another,
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:58.100]   and then just kind of sets the same thing in motion.
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:00.700]   It can be kind of a self-perpetuating system.
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:03.740]   By changing the number of features that are in that loop,
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:06.680]   it disrupts the closed nature of that loop.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.500]   It creates what we call an open loop.
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.540]   And in an open loop, you are better able to intervene.
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:14.420]   So as I mentioned before, this might seem counterintuitive.
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:17.140]   You might think, why would I want to reward the execution
[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:19.860]   of a bad habit with a good habit?
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:22.100]   I don't want to reward myself for the bad habit,
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:23.380]   but really what you're trying to do
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:26.580]   is you're trying to change the nature of the neural circuits
[01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:29.380]   that are firing so that you can rewrite the script
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.200]   for that bad habit.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:34.500]   A different way to put it would be,
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:38.660]   imagine that the bad habit is like a chord on the piano
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:40.240]   that you play, or a chord of notes,
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.500]   or a sequence of notes that you would play.
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.120]   And it comes very easily.
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:45.820]   You can play it every single time.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:47.880]   But let's say as you're trying to learn a new piece of music,
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.300]   you're just constantly inserting that
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.380]   at the inappropriate times.
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.340]   That was a, you know,
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:53.760]   I think it's a decent enough analogy for a bad habit
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.620]   because it involves some motor execution.
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.260]   You just find yourself doing it.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:59.740]   Rather than trying to prevent yourself from doing it,
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.240]   the next time you do it,
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:05.680]   add in a new quarter sequence that you're trying to learn.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.280]   What this does then is it changes the whole nature
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.440]   of the sequence of neurons that are firing
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.720]   from bad habit through to the end
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:15.440]   of this newly applied good habit.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:19.360]   So this is the way in which you start to dismantle,
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.700]   or when I say dismantle, really weaken the likelihood
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:25.120]   that if neuron A fires, neuron B will fire.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:28.100]   Because as you're starting off in the mode
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.760]   of very reflexively performing a bad habit,
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.620]   those neurons are firing together
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.660]   without you consciously being aware of it.
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:38.820]   It's almost impossible for you to intervene in yourself
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:42.380]   without a number of other features like severe punishment,
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:45.260]   severe consequence type outcomes.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.000]   Rather tacking on some additional sequences,
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.560]   like if neuron A fires, neuron B fires,
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:53.220]   and then you're saying, okay, well, if neuron B fires,
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:57.580]   I'm going to start inserting neuron CDEF to fire, right?
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:00.860]   That's the CDEF being the positive behavior
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:02.020]   that you're going to insert.
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:05.400]   And in doing so, you create a chain of neuronal activation
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.820]   that then is very easy to dismantle.
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:11.460]   And so when people have applied this kind of approach,
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:15.380]   it removes the need to have constant conscious awareness
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.420]   of one's own behavior prior to that behavior,
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:20.920]   which is very, very difficult to achieve.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.420]   Rather, what they find is that they are able to engage
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.900]   in remapping of the neural circuits associated
[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.180]   with bad habits in ways
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:30.820]   that are very, very straightforward, right?
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:32.540]   Because you can always identify
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:34.180]   when you've done the thing you don't want to do,
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.620]   and then tack onto that something additional
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:37.680]   that's positive.
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:40.680]   Now, the nature of that positive thing is important.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:41.740]   You don't want it to be something
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:42.980]   that's very hard to execute.
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.580]   You want it to be something that's positive
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.360]   and fairly easy to execute
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.060]   so that you're not struggling all the time
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.340]   to insert this on top of this bad behavior,
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:53.500]   whatever that bad behavior might happen to be.
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.520]   But again, this is rooted in the biology
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.800]   of long-term depression.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.620]   It maps very well to the behavioral change literature
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:01.380]   that I was able to glean that really shows
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:03.220]   that rather than just get reminders,
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.880]   rather than trying to instill punishment,
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.740]   rather than setting up reward for breaking bad habits,
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:10.120]   that perhaps the simplest way to approach this
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:13.600]   is to tack on additional behaviors to the bad habits,
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.980]   make sure those behaviors are good behaviors
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:18.220]   or behaviors that are adaptive for you.
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:20.620]   And in doing so, you will soon find
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:22.460]   that the initiation of the bad habit
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:23.620]   takes on a whole new form
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:26.220]   or that you're not even inspired to do it at all.
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:27.620]   And of course, I want to acknowledge
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:30.440]   that breaking bad habits is really hard.
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.940]   We had an episode all about addiction
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:36.080]   with Dr. Anna Lemke from Stanford Medical School.
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:37.420]   She's a colleague of mine
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:41.180]   who runs the dual diagnosis addiction clinic at Stanford.
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:44.120]   And in that episode, we talked a lot about how addicts
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.400]   for drugs, alcohol, people who have addictions
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:50.500]   to certain types of behaviors or avoidance behaviors even,
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:51.780]   that in the case of addiction,
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:55.420]   there has to be a tremendous kind of full-scale campaign
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:57.500]   for them to be able to intervene in their behavior.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:58.580]   So for those of you that are thinking
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.660]   about bad habit breaking
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.300]   in the context of addictive type behaviors,
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.140]   definitely check out that episode.
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.620]   Addiction does employ some of these principles
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:11.980]   around habit making and habit breaking, as it were.
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:15.940]   But of course, because the consequences of certain habits
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:18.140]   in addiction can be so severe,
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:19.980]   there's other sets of protocols
[01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:22.060]   and there's a kind of a psychological backdrop to it
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.160]   that's very important.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.020]   It also relates to the biology of dopamine,
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:26.100]   and you can find all of that
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:28.460]   in the episode with Dr. Anna Lemke.
[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:31.300]   So today we've covered a lot about the biology
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:35.000]   and psychology of habit formation and habit breaking.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000]   We talked about why certain habits are so hard to wire in,
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.980]   why certain habits are so hard to break down and eliminate,
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:48.160]   and how we can determine which habits are going to be easier
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:50.940]   for us to access, which habits are going to be harder
[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:53.420]   for us to access and break.
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:55.880]   We talked a lot about this notion of limbic friction,
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.740]   and we talked about context dependence,
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:00.920]   and we talked about a number of different things
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.560]   as it relates to neural circuits
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.000]   and the formation of new connections in the brain
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.880]   and strengthening and weakening of connections in the brain.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:10.340]   We also discussed two programs,
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:12.160]   programs designed specifically for you
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.020]   on the basis of the neurobiology literature
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:17.400]   and the literature on the psychology of habit formation
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.500]   and habit breaking.
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:20.120]   Just to briefly recap,
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:24.380]   one program involves dividing the 24-hour day
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:27.660]   into three phases, phase one, phase two, phase three,
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:30.260]   and to try and tackle specific habits
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:33.860]   at particular phases of the 24-hour cycle.
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:37.560]   The second program involved a 21-day process
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:41.700]   of engaging approximately six new habits per day,
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:43.460]   although the expectation, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:46.120]   is that you're not going to perform all six of those,
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.660]   and an assessment in the following 21 days
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:50.500]   as to whether or not you have indeed
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.700]   formed those new habits or not.
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:55.020]   And there were a number of other features that I mentioned
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:57.140]   that were related to those two general programs,
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:00.200]   phase one, phase two, phase three, and the 21-day program,
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.420]   and how those could be meshed together.
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:04.780]   So I'm guessing some of you will probably have questions
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:06.900]   about those programs and how to apply them,
[01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:09.860]   but hopefully they were clear enough for you to get started.
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:11.800]   This is a good opportunity for me to mention
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.700]   that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:16.360]   has something called the Neural Network Newsletter
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:19.560]   that is sent out approximately once a month.
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:21.120]   For the next newsletter,
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.940]   I will release a on-paper version of these two systems
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.040]   and how they mesh together
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.380]   for habit formation and habit breaking.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:31.340]   And if you'd like to access that,
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:33.880]   you can go to HubermanLab.com, you go to the menu,
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.480]   you can sign up for the newsletter.
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:37.580]   First of all, it's zero cost.
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:40.000]   Second of all, we have our privacy policy there,
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.080]   but I can tell you right now we don't share your email
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.460]   with any vendors or any other sources.
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:47.080]   Those emails stay internal to us.
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.060]   And if you'd like to see what the sort of flavor
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:52.620]   of those newsletters is, the previous newsletters,
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:54.740]   for instance, one on tools for sleep
[01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:58.300]   that I mentioned earlier, or tools for neuroplasticity
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:00.600]   in the classroom and outside the classroom as well
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.780]   for teachers and for students of various kinds,
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:04.300]   those are also posted there
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:07.100]   so you can access any of the previous newsletters.
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:08.580]   My hope is that today you've learned
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:11.540]   both the biological mechanisms and the practical tools
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:15.160]   by which you can start to establish habits that for you,
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.080]   you deem adaptive, healthy,
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.900]   and that are going to support you and your goals.
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:21.860]   And that you can start to dismantle some of the habits
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:25.140]   that you find to be unhealthy or maladaptive for you
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:26.520]   and for your goals.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.660]   If you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,

[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.480]   During today's podcast and in many previous episodes
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:12.120]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, I mentioned supplements.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.720]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.600]   many people derive tremendous benefit from supplements.
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.540]   Supplements for sleep, supplements for focus,
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:20.940]   supplements for various other things
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.800]   related to mental and physical health and performance.
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.020]   One key issue anytime there's a discussion about supplements
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:30.060]   is you have to be sure that the supplements you are taking
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:31.460]   are of the very highest quality.
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.580]   And for that reason, we've partnered with Thorne
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:35.740]   because Thorne has the very highest stringency
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:38.220]   with respect to the quality of the ingredients they include
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:40.480]   and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:42.540]   that they include in their supplements.
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:44.620]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:46.860]   and get 20% off any of those supplements,
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:51.740]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:54.340]   And in addition to being able to get 20% off
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:56.460]   any of those supplements, if you navigate deeper
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.500]   into the Thorne site through that web portal,
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:02.140]   thorne.com/u/huberman, you can also get 20% off
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:04.480]   any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:07.220]   If you're not already following us on Instagram and Twitter,
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:08.980]   please feel free to do so.
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:12.100]   There, I teach neuroscience and neuroscience-related tools
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.640]   in short format.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.060]   Some of that material overlaps
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:16.340]   with what you hear on the podcast.
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:17.840]   Some of it is unique and different
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:19.300]   from what's on the podcast.
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:21.000]   And once again, I want to thank you
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.940]   for going on this journey of exploring the neuroscience
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:28.100]   and the psychology of habit formation and habit breaking.
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:29.940]   I hope it supports you in your goals.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:32.100]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.860]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:36.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:39.020]   (upbeat music)
