[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper, and once again
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.520]   we're going to address a sensitive subject today that is not suitable for
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.660]   younger listeners, and sadly this is a question that we get a lot, a lot
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.920]   more than you might think. Pastor John, somewhere around 30 times over the years
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.400]   this question has come in. We haven't addressed it yet. It comes sometimes from
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.960]   men, but mostly from perplexed women, and most recently the question came from an
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.280]   anonymous listener who simply asks this, "Pastor John, is it sinful to watch
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:42.720]   pornography with my spouse before sex?" Yes, it is. It is sin, and it is a
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:54.720]   revolting sin, and what makes it so revolting is that in that sacred moment,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.920]   very sacred moment, I wonder if our questioner even has a concept of sacred
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   or sacred sexuality. In that sacred moment, corruption is abounding in three
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.320]   directions, toward Christ, toward the spouse, which I assume is a wife here
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.840]   being asked to do this, and the marriage, and toward people, so the spouse and
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.040]   marriage and toward people in the pornography. In other words, in so many
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.960]   directions, defilement is happening in the mind that carries those sinful
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.480]   images all the way through life, day and night. This act, sexual union of husband
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.520]   and wife, is the apex of marital pleasures that represent the pure and
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.040]   holy pleasures between Christ and his church. That's the meaning of sexual
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:15.200]   intercourse. When the Bible says, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.280]   church," it is inconceivable that the pleasures Christ has in the church would
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.640]   be awakened and stimulated by his imaging a prostitute to get his juices
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.840]   flowing. This act of marital sexual union is one of the most intense expressions
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   of the very meaning of marriage, namely, the truth of the words, and I mean words
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:57.480]   spoken, I pray, in the sexual embrace with your eyes six inches from hers, "You have
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:08.040]   I chosen above all others. You alone are the one where I feast with pure and
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   unsullied pleasure. I have eyes for no one but you. I do not run after other
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:29.000]   women in my mind or in my body. I am utterly devoted to you with my mind, with
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.200]   my eyes, with my body. You alone are my pleasure." That's marriage. That's how the
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:49.800]   Lord Jesus relates to his bride. That's what you vow at the altar. He has eyes.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:04:01.200]   Jesus has eyes for no other. What does it say about Christ and his love to his
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.680]   church if you feed the moment of sweetest, purest union with the poison of
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:21.720]   putrid food from pornographic sexual sin? And make no mistake, the performing and
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:32.440]   filming of pornographic acts is sin. What they are doing is sin. They're not acting
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.680]   for the glory of God as you watch them. They're not acting in step with the
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.400]   gospel. They're not pursuing holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.560]   They're not acting from faith in Christ, and whatever is not from faith is sin.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.360]   They're not putting to death what is earthly and setting their minds on
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.520]   Christ and the things above. They're not inspiring righteousness and purity and
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:10.680]   self-sacrificing love in anybody. They are modeling selfish indulgence, bondage
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.440]   to the flesh, rebellion against God, and the desire to suck as many people into
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.300]   their sin as they can. And this is the wine you would drink to assist in the
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.560]   sacred enactment of the purest Christ-exalting marital pleasures. I do
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.040]   not know if you're a husband or a wife who asked this question. It is difficult
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.960]   to imagine a wife urging this on her husband. So let me say to the man, "This is
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:51.400]   a great insult to your wife. If you have tempted her, cajoled her, lured her,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.040]   persuaded her, seduced her into this pornographic delusion of marital love,
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.960]   you should be ashamed. You should repent now to God, and you should tell her how
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   sorry you are for contaminating something so pure, so tender, so deep, so
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:20.440]   holy with something so vile. And yes, you should say "vile." You need to have a word
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:28.880]   like "vile" in your vocabulary. She is not honored by this practice. She is debased.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   And a husband who insists on this is acting like an animal, not a husband. So
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:46.320]   yes, this is a sin, a revolting sin. Revolting because it blasphemes Christ
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.240]   as if he needed sin to help him love his bride, because it celebrates the sickness
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:02.920]   and sin of the pornography industry, and because it insults the preciousness of a
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   wife's heart and body by the one above all others who should cherish and
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.800]   nourish her soul. Deeply sobering words, Pastor John. Thank you for tackling this
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.520]   question, and thank you to the listeners who have over the years sent in questions
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.000]   on sensitive topics like this one. It's hard to talk about, but it's necessary
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.760]   that we do. Well, let's end this episode on a happier note of celebration. This is
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.200]   the anniversary of the Reformation. It's coming up next week. 499 years ago on
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.960]   Monday, Martin Luther wrote his 95 Theses, and he sent them to the Archbishop.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.760]   And about a month later, legend says he nailed them to the door of All Saints
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.280]   Church in Wittenberg. And we celebrate the date of the letter when Luther
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.300]   wrote these things down and sent them to the Archbishop. It was a shot across the
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.000]   bow for sure, and it was a moment that we celebrate in Reformation Day, as we now
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.440]   call it, which is celebrated on the same day as Halloween in the States. And we
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.600]   have a couple of questions on the lingering importance of the Reformation,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.520]   and I'll serve those up to John Piper on Friday, and then on Monday. I'm your host
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.760]   Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
