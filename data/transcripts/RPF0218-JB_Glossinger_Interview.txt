[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I figured it would only be fitting.

[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   We're gonna talk about his story and also
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   all the stuff that you can do every day

[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Interview for you, as I said, JB Glossinger,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   founder of themorningcoach.com.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He's been doing this podcasting thing for a very long time.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And I want you to learn a couple of things
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   that are important in today's show.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Number one, listen to his actual coaching advice,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   but also listen to his story of how he transitioned
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   from something he hated to something he loved.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Pointing it out to you 'cause I see it everywhere,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and since I see it everywhere, I gotta point it out to you,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   is the best way to build financial independence
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and financial freedom for you is just simply transition
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   from something that's not a good fit for who you are
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   as a person, your skills, talents, knowledge,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   and ability, interests, goals, et cetera,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   to something that is a good fit for you.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And that road of transition might be tough
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   or it might not be.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And regardless of how difficult it is
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   or how long it takes, it's still worth it.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Here's JB.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   (swoosh)
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   JB, welcome to the Radical Personal Findings Podcast.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I appreciate you being with me.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   - Hey, I'm glad to be here.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Excited, excited.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   - Been looking forward to chatting with you
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   ever since we met at the podcast South Florida meetup
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   a couple months ago.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And I'd like to start with talking a little bit
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   about your day-to-day work as a coach.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Before we get into actually your advice for people, though,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   what's your story and your background
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   with regard to building a life that you love
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and building a lifestyle of freedom?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   How did you wind up in this world of coaching?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   - Well, I stumbled and bumbled and fell forward, I guess,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   and failed a lot.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   That's kind of how I got there,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   just by making a lot of mistakes.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I gotta say, it's not been a pretty picture.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I was in corporate forever, thought that was my dream,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   did the MBA, did the PhD, went through school,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   spent tons of money, got totally into student loan debt
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and woke up one day just wondering,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   what the hell am I doing with my life?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Sitting in an office on the board of directors,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   making a ton of money in a very glamorous position.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I actually went from selling aircraft,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   literally aircraft, to running a host shop
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   for aircraft here in South Florida
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   because they needed some help down in Miami.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And I was just miserable, man.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I was getting up Monday morning, going in, hungover,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and then work until Friday, and then Friday night
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   going out and just trying to forget about my life.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And on the outside, everybody,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   it looked like this great life, company car,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   board of directors, a lot of money,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   but on the inside, I was crumbling.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So the money was great, but my life wasn't.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And I knew that I needed to make a change
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   because I always said, if I'm gonna be the person
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   that's always complaining,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   that that means there's a change that needs to be made.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And I decided to make a change,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and I wrote a book because I'd followed Tony Robbins
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and all the great pioneers in personal development,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Zig Ziglar and Tom Hopkins and those guys,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   and said, "Hey, I can do that."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And I wrote a book and decided to go out
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and put a website together and go out
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   and promote this book and become a speaker.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   But I didn't realize that there's a lot more to it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   You just don't write a book and build a website.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I thought everybody would buy my book
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and everybody would come to my website.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   In fact, I spent 40 grand on the book,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and we put all of our savings in this business,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   and I just failed.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It was really ugly.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I quit my job.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Anybody with a dream,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   it wasn't the smartest thing to do.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Now I had no revenue.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I had no way to pay the bills,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   but I had a house full of books.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And so it was really ugly.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Many times I almost gave up and went back
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and got the paycheck,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Sometimes you need to go get the paycheck.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   But I stuck with it long enough and really failed forward.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I did a podcast that got really successful,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and over a couple years it was free,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   and then we went to paid.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   That's what allowed me to eventually break free.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   But it really was just chasing my dream
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and working on it every day
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and taking a lot of chances
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and failing over and over again
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and not really worrying about what everybody else thought
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   through that failure.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   That's what got me to the point where now I'm pretty much done.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I actually do my podcast,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   my motivational stuff, on the weekend.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   On Sunday night for two hours.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I used to do it every morning,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   and now I do it on Sunday.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I do five of them just because I like the energy.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I'm all in one place.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Plus, it gives me nothing to do during the week.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I literally play golf every day,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   just write and have fun.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I don't have any really commitments anymore,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and it's just a wonderful place to be.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I've been able to build systems to give me freedom.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   What's crazy is my business doubles and triples
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   and quadruples every single year using these systems.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's just been really a fun ride,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   but a painful one at that.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I wouldn't wish those first five years on anybody,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   but here I am ten years later,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   the overnight success, and it feels good.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I've got to be honest.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It feels good.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   The ten-year overnight success,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   just like every other overnight success
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   that I've ever talked to in my life.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Exactly.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   They weren't with me for the first five years.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You know what's funny is those five years
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   when we were losing everything,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   nobody wanted to be with me.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I was like, "Why can't we sell a damn book?"
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   or "Why won't somebody listen to me?"
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It was a challenge.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   We just kept going after it and rowing the boat
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   and here we are.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   What's interesting to me is just kind of hearing
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   your own progress.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   At what point did you walk away from the corporate job?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   When I banked in my head,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I call it banking in my head.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I did the math and I said,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   "Okay, if I buy these 4,000 books,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   "10 bucks a piece, and sell them for 25 bucks,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   "that would give me enough money to get going."
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But when all the books came in
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and then I sold five copies in the first month,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   then it got really scary.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I thought I was going to make all this money
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and you put a website and it just works,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   but it just didn't work.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   The reason I was asking is because it's funny
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   because it sounds almost like my own story
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   with radical personal finance.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I was doing well, had the nice practice
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   that I thought I wanted,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   and then it's like, "This needs to be done."
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Unfortunately, there was no way for me
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   to build radical personal finance
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   as a practicing financial advisor
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   due to the industry laws.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I did what I would advise no one else to do,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   which was just simply walk away
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   without a business plan.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I have a plan, I mean a little bit of a plan,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and I'm a year into it,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   so it's just nice to know that other people
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   have gone that path before.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   - Yeah, and I'm a very analytical
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   and detailed person, very anal,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   but sometimes you just got to take the chance.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I call it intelligent life design.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I teach it.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Do your hobby or passion two hours
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   or three hours a day and keep your job.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I think it's a better way to do it,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   honestly, for a lot of people.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I think it's smarter.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   But you know what?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   There's a couple of us crazy people
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   that just jump in.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And you learn.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I mean you really learn,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   and you become an entrepreneur.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   You realize that weekly paycheck's
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   not gonna come in,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   and that makes it really difficult.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   - So I'd love your input as a coach
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   and to talk about some of the types of things
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   that listeners can do to improve their mindset.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And what's interesting is
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   you are working in an industry
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   that there's a lot of shysters,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   and there's a lot of great leaders.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   So in your work as the morning coach,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   what have you learned is probably the biggest area
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   that most people ignore
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   that impacts their either success or failure in life?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   - Honestly, I think it's the egoic attachment to things.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   You know, so many people are,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   since we're talking about finance
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   and that area of life,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   let's talk about that.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   So many people are striving to get more
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and to bring more into their life.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   But the truth is if they could set up
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   residual or passive income streams
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   for $3,000 to $10,000 a month,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   they could probably do so much more with their life.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   But because they've got themselves set up
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   on a $11,000 to $15,000 or $20,000 a month,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   not because it was an egoic thing.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You know, they gotta have their Mercedes,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   they gotta have the six-bedroom house,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   they have to continually push, push, push
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   to try to keep up with the Joneses,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   they lose their freedom.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And I know that 'cause that's what I did,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   and a lot of people are doing that.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And it's a scary thing
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   because there's so many people
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   that are close to freedom
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   where they could spend more times with their family,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   their children, or just themselves,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   or going to the beach, or playing golf.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   If they just step back a little bit
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   from what they've been taught
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   and recognize that there are other ways to do things.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And I think that's the big thing.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Yes, I'm a personal development guy,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   but my dream is to have a million friends
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and then help a million people become free or more.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And that's really important to me
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   is to see people create streams of income
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   and get their time back.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Because at the end of the day,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   we talk about finance all day.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You can always make more money,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   but you can't make more time.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And I just see people crumbling because of this,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and they just get themselves in the hamster wheel,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and they can't get out.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And it's a sad place to be
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   because they don't have freedom.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And I really want to help people do that.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And in order to do that,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   you've got to find your authentic, true self
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   and stop worrying about what other people think.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   - Expand on how you actually deal with it.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   You just gave a start of an answer there,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   but let's say I've identified that, man,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I'm really caught up in living a lifestyle
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   that might seem impressive in the pictures on Facebook.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   What do I actually do about that?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   - Yeah, well, you've got to just realize
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   that you've got to be true and honest to yourself
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and start to step back and, first of all,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   organize your finances and see what you really need,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   and then maybe cut back a little bit
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   and recognize that you don't need to buy things
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   or do things for other people.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And getting more of a prosperity mindset
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   or an investment mindset is critical.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Become a producer instead of a consumer.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And 90% of the people out there are consumers out there.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And the more you can produce,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   the more you can understand value
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   and put it out into the world,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   the more you're going to be able to step back
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and then achieve freedom.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And then in that free area
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   is when you can just be yourself.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And I think it's important.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   When I wrote my book and went out there,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I paid $5,000.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I had no money.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I mean, we were broke and broke,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and I paid $5,000 to an image consultant.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And I put this suit on.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I mean, you can see I did an NBC interview
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   that this PR agency got me,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   and I looked like an idiot, really.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   It wasn't me.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And I just was egoic.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I thought that you had to do all these things
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   the way people tell you to do them.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And I sucked so bad that I finally realized
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   that if I'm going to lose all my money,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I'm going to suck.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I'm going to be myself.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And that was a turning point in my business, in my life.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I just quit caring.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I was like, "I'm going to do the things I want to do
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   "the way I want to do them,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   "and you know what?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   "I'll find people that are the same.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   "And if nobody likes me and it doesn't work,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   "well, there's always McDonald's."
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And that really was my mindset.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And it's what finally turned it.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Instead of trying to focus on what other people thought
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and what other people needed me to be,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I finally stepped back and said,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "Okay, what do I want to be,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   "and how do I want my life to look like?"
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So I think the key thing is to first understand
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   that aspect of it and get really clear
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   of how you want your life to be.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And I'm going to tell you,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   being a housewife of Atlanta
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   or living those lifestyles that are very empty and shallow
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   is not the life that most people want,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   but that's what they're trying to live like.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   They're trying to live like the Kardashians.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   They're trying to live these lives
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   that are just really reality-based TV,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and there's no truth to that.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   It's sad.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   So how do you identify, though,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   the difference between being yourself,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   being like you want to be,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   being your authentic self,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   versus recognizing the fact that in the marketplace,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   perception is reality.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   People do perceive you in a certain way,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and it might be intelligent to listen
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   to some of the coaching that would tell you
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   to make sure that you're presenting yourself
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   to the marketplace carefully.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Where's the distinction between those things?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   - I think that's BS.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   There's billions of people in the world,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   billions, with a B.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   What I teach in the business side of things
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   is find 500 people that'll pay you $2,000 a year for value,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   and every single person I know is an expert in somebody
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   that would be listening to this show.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Yeah, there are some people that aren't there.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   We know that, and they need education.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   They need to get themselves to the next level.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But if you build your business around producing revenue
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   and producing value that produces revenue
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   at $2,000 a year, 500 people,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   which every single person that's listening to this knows,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   that's a million-dollar business.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So there are people making money
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   in every single market sector.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   There's people on Amazon writing dinosaur porn books
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   and making a ton of money.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   (laughing)
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   This is the greatest time to be alive.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And I think most people are just too concerned
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   about what other people are doing
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   and not willing to give their love or their passion time.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   That's the key thing.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   You find a few people, you give value out there,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   you grow, you learn, you develop,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   and you build your platform.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   It's there for every, if I could do this,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   believe me, anybody could do it.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   - I don't know, you're Mr. MBA and PhD.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   - No, but that's--
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   - It's a good way of selling it,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   but you're obviously a pretty capable guy.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   - Well, let me tell you that.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I wanna talk about that 'cause it's really important, Joshua.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I'm glad you bring that up.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I do not use that much.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   You know, I got a big book coming out with Hay House
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   and they threw a PhD up there.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And I'm telling them I don't want it on my name
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   because that was a crutch.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   When I was getting into this business,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   I thought I needed gray hair.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   (laughing)
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   It's a true story.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And I thought I needed an MBA
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   and I thought I needed a PhD.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And that's the only reason I spent all that money.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And it was a waste of time and energy and effort.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Yes, I learned a little bit from it.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   But at the end of the day,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I don't even like those things anymore.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I don't even want those letters
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   because those were my crutch
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   that I thought I needed to be successful.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   And I didn't need those things.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   So you just gotta caution that.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I mean, I meet people every single day
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   from all walks of life.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   You know, my new passion is golf,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   so I'm on the golf course every day.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And you know, most people that can golf a lot
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   have very different lifestyles, you know.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Not too many people golf every single day.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And so I'm able to travel
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   and go to some of these really cool courses
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   and meet some really cool people.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And they all have this common thread of uniqueness.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   That they've found this unique ability
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   to do the things they want.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Yeah, there's this certain sector
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   that has had money passed down,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   the lucky sperm, I like to call it, right?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   But at the end of the day,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   the people that are really successful
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   are the ones that have found their true, authentic self
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   and they've put something out
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   and they've put their passion,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   their love, their joy out there.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   And that's what I really want to help people find
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   is that ability to get up in the morning
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   and be excited about life, you know?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   It's like, I don't like to sleep at night
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   and I love to get up
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   because I'm ready to challenge the day.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   And so many people don't even want to get out of bed
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and it's so sad.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   It's just sad to me.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   - I understand what you're saying
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   about the MBA and PhD
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   because it aligns with my own experience.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   When I started in the financial planning business,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I was 23 years old
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   and I had an incredible perception of,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I struggled with the fact
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   of who's going to listen to me.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I'm 23 years old
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   and I have a tremendous baby face,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   so therefore I felt like I needed to prove to people
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   that I knew what I was talking about.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   So I went out and got a bunch of designations.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I got a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I got a CFP and a bunch of other stuff
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   that all matters to a very small number of people.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And now I look at that
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   and I look back and I think about today,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I could walk in in a pair of board shorts
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   and a t-shirt with a yellow pad
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   and a financial calculator and a pen
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and I can do a financial plan for somebody
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   because I'm confident in what I know.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And I don't need the CFP and the CLU
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   and all that stuff
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   because that's become part of my confidence.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   It's become part of who I am.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And so today, it wouldn't matter to me
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   whether it's there or not.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I leave it there in case somebody ever,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   it ever is helpful to somebody.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   But to me though,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I don't think I could have made that shift
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   without going through the process of the work.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And I'm not sure you could have made this shift
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   and developed the confidence
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   without going through the process of the work.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Do you think I'm wrong?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   No, I think we're all on our own pace.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I mean, Michael Dell, Quick College,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Bill Gates, Steve Jobs,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I mean, they didn't even finish college.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   I mean, but their passion flew through.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I think everybody's on a different path.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   So I'm not saying it's right or wrong
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   to get the education.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   No, I think it's great.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I think education's awesome.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   I think the problem is when you think
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   that you need the education,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   it's your crutch.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   You know, I wish I would have went back.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   If I had to do it all over again,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   I would have went for the education.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I was there for the letters
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   because I thought that would take me
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   to the next place.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   So I have nothing wrong with it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   I think it's great.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   If you can come from a place of authenticity
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and do your MBA,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It wouldn't be what I was there for
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   because I was there for the next career jump.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So interestingly, I 100% agree with you
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   because if I were going to go back
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   and do it again,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I would do the same thing.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I wouldn't have gotten a business degree.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I would go and get a degree in,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I don't know, something like philosophy
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   or something that I cared about
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   instead of just what I needed to do
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   to get into the business world.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And all the financial planning classes,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I just lined them up and took tests
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   to get as many letters as possible.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And I wish I had slowed down
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   and absorbed more of the information
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   and learned it better than I did
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   because that was just about getting things done.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   So we share the same perspective on that.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Yeah, well, I think everybody does.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   I mean, we don't have to pull any punches.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I mean, people are trying to get ahead, right?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   I mean, that's the truth.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I mean, I have not met one person
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   that I talked to that doesn't love freedom
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and to make more money.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I mean, I have not met one person,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   even Mother Teresa.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   The reason Mother Teresa was so successful
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   is because she could raise money, right?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   I mean, it just is what it is.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   So we have to have that background.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   My issue is that when we get so egoic,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   we get so caught up in TV
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   and just going throughout the minutia of the day
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   and plopping down and watching the next Breaking Bad,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   which I have no problem with.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I love Breaking Bad.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   I just finished it, but I watch it on Netflix.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   I watch three of them at a time and on airplanes.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   But we got to open our minds
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   to the pure potential that's in the world.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I know that's deep,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   but there's billions of people in the world
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and we got to open our dream
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   or start to build our dream.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And we just got to allow time to take place.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   And whatever business that you're in,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   I don't care.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   I have friends that build yachts.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I have all different types of friends,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   and all of them had to start somewhere.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And there's a thing in Zen that says the beginner mind.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And we don't allow ourselves to be a beginner enough.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And people buy passion.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And if you're passionate and excited
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   about the things in your life,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   that's going to come through.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And I don't know a person in the world
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   that can't do that,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   that has the motivation and wants to do it.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   There are a lot of entitled people
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   that just don't want to, and that's cool.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   But anybody that's listening to this,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   obviously, is somebody that has the ability.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   They just need to borrow the belief
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   and then have the patience enough
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   to build something that is going to work for them.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And personally, I would think they should
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   search residual and passive income type streams
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   or buy businesses, which is another thing I do,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   to try to generate revenue.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Because I just think it's just a wonderful time to do that.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And I think that's what creates true financial security.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And not only that, you made a great point, Joshua,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   is the lessons that you learn by doing those things
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   is really what's going to help you in the future.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   You've been doing this for 10 years.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   What's a story that stands out in your mind
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   as one of the most unlikely transformations
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   that you've seen with somebody
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   that's been involved in your coaching community?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Well, do you want me to talk about business
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   or personal life?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Because I have a couple.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   One of each.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Okay, well, in personal life, I'll tell you,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   my avatar, and I think everybody needs an avatar.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   That's the person you speak to.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   So when I sit down to write a blog
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   or write my book with Hay House
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   or to do a podcast or something in that manner,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I always have somebody.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And the one person I have is a woman
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   who lived in Europe, actually started in California,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   married a gentleman from Europe
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   and moved to Europe with him.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And she sent me a seven-page letter.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   So I opened this letter up one day,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   and she told me how awesome her life started,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   that they had two beautiful kids,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   and she was in Europe.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And about two months into the deal,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   he started to beat her.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And so she used to hide in the closet.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   That was her thing.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   He would beat her, and she would go in the closet.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And so I'm reading this in a letter,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Joshua, by the way, which is pretty intense,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   and I'm reading about her being beat.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And then I read that she found me.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And she found me on iTunes
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and started listening to me every day.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And she would get beat,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   and she would go in there with her little iPhone,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and she would listen to me,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   trying to get her going.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And finally, and again, I'm reading this letter,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   she said that he started beating the kids.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And she didn't have any strength,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   but she listened to me every day,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   and she said, "You know what?
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   "This guy's telling me to go after my dreams,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   "and I believe I can do this."
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   And she took the money out of the bank,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   like three grand, moved to California with her kids,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   left this guy, didn't know anybody there,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   still paid me my 20 bucks a month
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   to be a Morning Coach member.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And in this letter, she finished by saying that,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   "Yesterday I ran my first marathon.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   "My kids were at the finish line.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   "I have a beautiful husband now
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   "and a beautiful life in California.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   "I just want to thank you."
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And it's just a testament
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   to the power that we have to touch others.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I'm just a normal guy from Indiana.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I never thought.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   In fact, I look in the mirror a lot of times and say, "Why me?"
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   But now, any time I need to get my butt up
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   and focus on writing or do something
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   or say, "Hey, I'm not playing golf today,"
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I think of her.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And I think of that woman in the closet being beat.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And that's what we need.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   That's what people need.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   If people say, "J.B., I don't know
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   "if I can go out there and talk to other people.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   "I don't know if I can chase after my dreams."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I guarantee there's somebody that needs what you have.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   And that's my job.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   My job at Morning Coach and what I do
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   is to tell people to get out there and be great
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   because we need you.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   We do.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   We need everybody's greatness,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   whether it's curing cancer, which is awesome,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   or creating a new paper clip to put papers together.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   They're all relevant, and they all make the world better.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And so I'm kind of selfish in doing Morning Coach
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   because I want to have a better life
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   because of the greatness that people bring to me,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   the Teslas of the world,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   and all the things that are going on out there
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   to make our life better, the new MacBook that I got.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   All these things make my life better,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   but we can't make our lives better
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   unless we get greatness from individuals.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And that comes from people going after their dream.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   - That's a remarkable story.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   What about the business example?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   - Yeah, my business is another one.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Janelle Mills, she's the CEO of Kool Wazoo.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   She listened to Morning Coach
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   and was listening for a while, stay-at-home mom,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   three kids, took her kid to a swing set,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   set the baby in the swing set,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and the baby burned her butt.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And she's like, "I've got to do something about this."
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   So she created a product, listened to Morning Coach,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   got the beliefs, thought she could--
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   said, "I could do this."
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   I'll never forget the day I got a Skype from her
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   as a Morning Coach member.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   She goes, "Can I ask you a question on speaking?"
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And I said--she goes, "I've got this thing coming up."
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And I said, "Yeah."
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   I said, "What do I need to do?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   "These people are preparing me for a proposal."
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   I had no idea what it was, and I said, "Just be you.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   "Be you. People buy passion."
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   So she went on Shark Tank.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Went on Shark Tank, and everybody turned her down.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And then she started crying.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   She decided to be herself.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   I had no idea this was going on,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   and so she started, you know, crying and being herself
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   on why she's so passionate about this product,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and she got funded.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   So it was so cool to see somebody that listened to
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Morning Coach, stay-at-home mom,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   actually go on Shark Tank and get funded.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And I actually tell her story in my new book
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   that's coming out next year with Hay House
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   because I just think it's phenomenal.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And it's just a point.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   It's just proof that somebody--you know,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   business is finding a need and filling it.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   She found a need. She filled it.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   She's not killing it, but she's building a life.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   She's learning, and CEO of a company.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   You know, I just think it's awesome.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Yeah, and in today's world, I agree with you
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   as far as the opportunity that's out there.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   I don't think it's ever been easier for people
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   who have an idea and see a need to take that forward.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Whether or not you can take it all away,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   there's a big difference between starting and selling
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   one unit versus selling a billion units.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   You may not become a billionaire off of your idea,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   but you can at least move it forward.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And it's never been easier in the history of the world
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   to move business ideas forward
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and solve the needs that society has.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Three to ten grand a month, I mean,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   it creates freedom for most people, you know?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And if you're doing what you love every day,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   you don't work a day in your life, and it's the truth.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   So, you know, try to figure that out.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And you know what?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   If it takes you ten years to get to that point,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   was it worth it?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   You know, the towers were hit 14 years ago.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   What could people have done in that time
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   that could have changed their life to be making
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   three, five, ten thousand dollars a month
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   doing what they love?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   That's my dream.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   It's just what I do.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   You can tell I'm passionate about it
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   because there's nothing I like to see better
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   than when I see people take hold of that dream
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   and they go out there and make it happen.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And they fall down and get beat up and lose
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   and get back up again.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I just absolutely love it.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   - I know I spent a lot of years
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   consuming inspiration, encouragement, motivation,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   and really being fired up about the idea
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   of going out and getting my dreams
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   and fulfilling my passion.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And then I would sit down and say,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   "Well, wait a second.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   "I'm not sure what it is.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   "I don't know what my passion is.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   "I don't know what that business idea is."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And I spent years kind of looking for it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   I know a lot of my listeners are in a similar position
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   based upon some of the emails that I get.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   What advice do you give to somebody in that situation?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   - I would say, it's funny, I just did an e-book
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   called Seven Days of Finding Your Passion.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   We're gonna do some Facebook ads
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   to a conversion funnel to help people with this.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   But I think Steve Jobs, who I think
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   wasn't the nicest person in the world,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   but he said it best in his Stanford speech
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   that death is a great motivator.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   And I'm a positive guy,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   but sometimes you gotta embrace the dark side.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   You're not gonna be here.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   There's a video on YouTube that's viral
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   about jelly beans and how many moments
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   you're gonna have in your life.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I think you gotta look at your funeral.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And you gotta step back and see yourself.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   This is a great spiritual exercise, by the way, too.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   But see yourself and look back at your accomplishments
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   and the things that you did.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   That's one thing.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And as you look at that,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   you're gonna have some discoveries there.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   The other thing that I always suggest
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   to people that are stuck with their passion
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   is to go back to their childhood.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   If you come into my office,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I have an X2 robot, 2XL,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   from my childhood.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I used to play 8-track tapes.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   I have that.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   I put 'em in all the time.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I have a big Centurion helmet.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I got a big thing cut out of Groot behind me.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   I have an Excalibur poster.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I have Dungeons and Dragons books.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   I have comic books.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   All this stuff from my childhood
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I surround myself with.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And I actually go to eBay when I'm struggling,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   and I'll buy a toy from my childhood.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And it just brings back the passion
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   and the youthful energy.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And I think those two things,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   envision your funeral,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   if you wanna get a little bit morbid
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   and your left brain serious type,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   or if you're a little more right-brained and creative,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   then go back to your childhood.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Buy those toys.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Fill your office with them
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   and allow that creativity to flow,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and you'll find your passion.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   It's there.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And I think, really,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   the childhood one really works well
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   for a lot of people
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   because that's where it all began, right?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   And that energy's there.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   - You're pretty hardcore on entrepreneurship.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Do you think that you have to be an entrepreneur
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   to be free?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   - Absolutely not.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   I think there's a lot, you know,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   one of my big group in Morning Coach
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   that I love is HR.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   You know, they take care of the people at the jobs.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And I think you could be free
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   if you love your job.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   There's so many great doctors.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   There's so many nurses.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   There's janitors.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   There's nothing,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   I mean, I don't care what I'm doing.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   You know, I have a house in Bogota, South America.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And one of the reasons
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   I love to go to Columbia so much
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   is those people down there
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   are passionate about everything they do.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   You know, we have people come clean the house.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   They're passionate.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   They want to do the best job.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   The people want to cook.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   They want to be the best cooks.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   No, you don't have to be an entrepreneur.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   I love being an entrepreneur
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   and that's what we're talking about
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   'cause we're talking a little bit about finance.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   But there's nothing wrong
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   with growing up through a company
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   and being able to shape the culture
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   and be somebody that gets in there and really cares.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And I tell you what,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   if you take that attitude,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   a little bit entrepreneurial,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   but if you take that attitude
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   that I'm gonna come here
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   and I'm gonna do my best
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   to make this place great,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   you're gonna move right up the chain
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and you're gonna never have to worry
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   about financial matters.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   You're just gonna have to,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   you know, your time's gonna be off.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   But you'll get there someday
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   where you have four weeks vacation
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   and if you love what you do,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   hey, go in there and make a difference.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   So no, I love people that are in careers
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   as long as they're in careers
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   that they love to do.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   - The self-help section at the bookstore,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   at least my bookstore,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   is massive and it's packed.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   It's wall to wall.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And it's even bigger on the internet.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   All the time I'm finding a new YouTube channel
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   with another self-success guru.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I'm finding another website
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   from somebody who's decided
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   to set up a coaching business.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   There's a lot of voices out there.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   How do you differentiate
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   between the good ones
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   that can be useful and helpful
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and the ones who may be
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   leading you down a path
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   that might not have a lot of success in it?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   - You know what?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   There's a lot of great stuff in everything.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Even the garbage I've bought over the years.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   You know, I always have a percentage
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   that goes to my education budget.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   You even learn the stuff you shouldn't do.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   But at the end of the day,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   it's pretty simple.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   It's follow people
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   that are doing what you want to do.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And get coaching from people
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   that are doing things that you want to do.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's that simple.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   If you want lifestyle, I'm the perfect guy.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   I mean, that's what I live.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   If a speaker or a teacher or an educator
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   isn't willing to let you look into their life,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   there's an issue there.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   They have to be congruent
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   with what they're teaching.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And I think that's where Facebook
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and Twitter and all those areas,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   if you're a teacher, you gotta be out there.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   You can't, you know,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I've met so many of these people
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   that have never read their own books.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   You know, it's like, God, really?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Really?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And as I get deeper and deeper into the business,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   it's shocking to me.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   It's like, didn't you read your book?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   You know, but I'll be fully transparent.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   There's days on my golf course,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   you know, like today,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   I had a horrible day.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I was angry, I was frustrated.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   And you know, I wear three snappable rubber bands
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   and I wasn't snapping them.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And I knew I should have, you know.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   I use essential oils to keep myself positive.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   I smell peppermint, you know, those type of things.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And I wasn't congruent with my message today.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   We all fall down, even the best teachers.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   But at the end of the day, you know,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   you gotta dig into the people, do your research.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   You know, if you're a social media expert
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and you have 500 people on Twitter
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   and 1,000 Facebook likes,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   how the heck are you a social media expert?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Right?
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   - Right.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   - You know, I mean,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   it's just doing a little due diligence
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and digging in to find out
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   who the people really are.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   If you're a relationship expert
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   and you've had three divorces
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   and you're trying to teach people about marriage,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   I don't think there's congruency there.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Unless you're very honest and very transparent
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   that I've had three divorces
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and I could take you through that.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   So I think it's really important
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   that people do their due diligence
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   and learn about the people and who they are.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   It's critical.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And then, obviously, the big one is
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   get, you know, recommendations from other people.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And that's why I built Morning Coach as a community
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   more than anything else
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   is because I want a group of people together.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   I got tired of friends that didn't believe in me
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   and people that just didn't have the right attitude.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And this isn't some cheesy positive thing,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   like, "Oh, stay positive, read affirmations every day."
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It's just real people that are cool,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   that are trying to get ahead.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And that's what I try to put together.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Because I've been a product of all the books and tapes.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   They were tapes and then CDs,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   and now MP3s that I've read.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And I don't think you can not get away,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   you know, you can take something away from everything.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   But, yeah, you gotta be a little cautious.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   And if you see a book or something,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   you want to read or resource,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   do some due diligence, find out the person,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   read their backstory.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   And if you can't, run away,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   because they're hiding something.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   - There's probably a business for a success coach
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   who simply says, "I'm just gonna tell you
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   "about all my failures."
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Jim Rohn used to have a few lines about that,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   about how fascinating it would be to study somebody
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   who would just open up about all their failures.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   He could have learned what not to do.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I've never heard the person actually proclaim that,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   but I guess if somebody had been through five divorces,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   they could build a business and a career.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Just simply saying, "I have no idea how to run a marriage,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   "but let me tell you about the problems I've had,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   "and maybe you can spot some mistakes that you're making."
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Yeah, and I would love that.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I would love that.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   I mean, I don't like to speak in your coaching industry.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I'll just put it out there.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   I just am not a big fan of it.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I just see a lot of desperation in it.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   I see a lot of people just using it for an egoic basis
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and not really wanting to help people.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Honestly, I got to build a business too,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   but at the end of the day,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   you got to care about your people.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   We always go back to that.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   We're getting big.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Things are starting to really move for us.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   We always say the last person in is the most important.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Our events are getting bigger.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Everything for us is growing,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   my inner circle, my mastermind groups.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   I just care about people,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   and I believe that's why we're growing.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   I think that's why some people struggle as coaches
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   and as speakers, because I was that guy.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   I put the suit on.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   I just expected everybody to buy my book.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   My book was horrible.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   It wasn't edited properly.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   I just said, "I'll just sell people,"
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   because that's what I was good at for years.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   It wasn't until I got truly authentic,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   and then I started to really care about people,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   truly care, not just BS, "I need your money."
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   That's when things started to really flip for my business.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Now I got a whole team that does the same thing,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   and we're building this culture of really believing in people
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   and helping them go.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   I really, really suggest people do due diligence
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   on who they listen to.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   There's great teachers.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I wouldn't be where I'm at today without my teachers,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   but there's some bad ones out there too.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   You're 100% right.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   - You talked about investing a percentage of your income
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   back into your education,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and my mentors convinced me of the value of that
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   in years past.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Take me back over about the last 20 years,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   before Morning Coach and since then,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   and talk about some of the ways
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   that you've invested in yourself
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   and what has had the highest return
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and what perhaps didn't have a very high return for you.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   - I'm a product of what I've read and been to and watched.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   I try to read three books a week.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I've done that for as long as I can remember,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   even when I was poorer than poor,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and I had to go to Bookman's Bookstore in Tucson, Arizona,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and trade my books back in.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Literally, I was running a health club,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   running on 20, 30 bucks a week to eat and get my books.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I just read everything.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I mean, I just constantly, I still do.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I listen to a lot of audio books.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Right now, it's usually two books I read and one audio book,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   but I try to get through three books a week,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   which is kind of insane.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I listen to audio books on two times speed
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   when I walk the dog in the morning.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Got a system down for that.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Events, I think, are invaluable.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I don't like to travel.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   I absolutely hate networking.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I think if there is a hell somewhere and I go to hell,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I will be sent to a networking event.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I can't stand it.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   - I'm with you on that one.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   - Yeah, it sucks, but there's just something
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   about networking that's really good.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   I'm not networking, but events that are just amazing.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   I joined Jeff Walker's Mastermind,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   who's very successful, in Product Launch Formula
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   a couple years ago.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   I didn't believe in those groups.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   I just didn't think I needed them,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   and boy, has that changed my life.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   But events are very important.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Masterminding with other like-minded people
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   who have skin in the game.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   I'm paying $30,000 plus a year to be in Jeff's group,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   so when I sit down at that meeting,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   we know people have skin in the game.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   You're not going to pay that kind of money.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Most really good masterminds are $20,000 plus.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   If you're spending that kind of money,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   you're going to sit next to somebody
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   that's also committed.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   So those type of groups are great.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Events have been great throughout my life.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   When I was broke and I couldn't obviously do a mastermind,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   then I would go to events, 97th, 297th.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Whenever I could get, I would go to an event,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   which are very important.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Then I get audiobooks.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   I mentioned it, but I listen to Stephen King
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   on writing at least once a month,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   and I'm getting taught how to write by Stephen King.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   It's the best time to be alive.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Come on, give me a break.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Stephen King is teaching me how to write
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   for a $9.99 audiobook.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Where else are you going to get that?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   In my mind, that's one of the...
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   When people tell me I don't read,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I just think, "Huh? Are you stupid?"
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And you are, because you've got the greatest people
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   in any industry, in any part of society,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   any historical period,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   that have sat down and synthesized
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   decades of experience
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   into something that in 5, 10, 15, 20 hours,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   you can absorb decades of experience of this person.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And that's sitting there and you don't pursue it.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   You'd only stand on the shoulders of giants
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   if you actually climb up their backs.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   It's not some kind of automatic thing
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   that somehow because you magically are alive in 2015
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   that you can absorb the wisdom of the universe
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   through osmosis.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   You've got to sit down and educate yourself.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   And an audiobook is the best way to do that.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   100%.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   I'm a C student through college,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   all the way through, until I get to my upper grades.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Then I actually did good because I actually applied myself,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   but most of the time I was bored as hell
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   in those other classes.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And so I still have trouble adding up
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   my golf score at the end of the day.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   But the thing that I do have is tons of knowledge
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   about reading and I just think everybody should do that.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   It's why I'm here today.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the reading.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   - You built a business,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   and this is the final area I want to explore with you,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   you built a business Morning Coach,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   and this was based, as far as at least your initial approach,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   was based upon the concept of a daily coaching discussion.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Was that a unique concept at the time?
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   - Yes, I mean it was very unique.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   In our space, nobody had ever done it,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   and really nobody really ever still has.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Personal development every single day,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   creating a system, because one of the issues I had,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I'll just tell you quickly, the history of Morning Coach,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   I was going to get 52 different speakers and have them do it.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   I wasn't going to do it myself.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   I was going to get 52 speakers
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and then join the National Speaker's Association,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   and I just couldn't find speakers I wanted.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   I just couldn't find people that were in alignment with my methods,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   so I decided to do it.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Because the issue, what happened with me as a reader,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   is that I would read Tony's book, then Zig's book, then Covey's book,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   and I would start to apply these things,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   but I didn't even recognize I was confusing myself subconsciously.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   So where Morning Coach really started
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   is when I started to try to find speakers
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   to give me something every day,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   because I was running on that content, even with the books,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   and I wanted something consistent.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   So when I started to do that is when my life started to change.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   It started to move in another direction.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And so that system came to be that, hey, you can read everything.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   You can get all the information from all the different teachers,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   but get something consistently and concurrently on a daily basis.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   And all the great teachers have always said that.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Do 30 minutes of positive personal development every day.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   But the issue is when you're reading Jim Rohn and Stephen Covey
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   and Zig Ziglar and Tony Robbins,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   you're getting different philosophies every day,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   and if you don't have some glue to hold that together,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   it really can get frustrating,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   because subconsciously you're setting goals one way,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   and the next day you're doing something else.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   It's different to get inspiration.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   It's another thing to have a systematic system in place of your growth,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   because you're switching systems all the time.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   So that's where Morning Coach came from.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   It's like, man, I need a system.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   I need something that I can do every day that's going to be in alignment.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   So if I get an idea from Zig, it's not throwing something into the--
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   throwing a problem out there because I didn't realize it,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   because all of a sudden I'm reading another system on goal setting.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   It's a totally different one than I read yesterday.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   So that's the whole reason that Morning Coach came through,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   was there was this need for something in the morning
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   to really help people get a consistent system as they read their books,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   as they went to events, as they did everything else,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   not burn out from going to see Tony.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   They're all excited.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   They come back, and two weeks later, they're back into their regular life,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   but to have something that they could plug into
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   that was going to be consistent and similar in scope over the whole period.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   So what is the organizing framework, though?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Is it a unique system that you created,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   or is it just the fact that you have one specific actionable principle each day?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   No, it's pretty much the system that I've created from over the years.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   One of the big philosophies you have is the Sacred Six philosophy,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   which is the actual book coming out from Hay House.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   We have a lot of metaphysical aspects to it.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   We have Financial Fridays where we kind of go over
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   prosperity, consciousness, and things there.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So there's a lot of structure.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Mondays we organize.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Tuesdays we do personal evolution, personal development.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Wednesdays is a metaphysical spiritual day.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Thursday is a book study.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   We do people's various books, and then Friday is prosperity and abundance.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   So we have a structure that we're always constantly working.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And the idea is to focus on 1% improvement.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   That's it. 1% improvement.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And people that plug into the system get really great results
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   because it's a simple system yet effective because it's consistent.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   It's every day.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   And I don't care if it was me or somebody else.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   We did some growth work every single day, whether you're listening to me or somebody else.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   It's going to work.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   You just got to give it time, be patient, and commit to it.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Yeah, that's been my experience.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   And last question on this, and then we'll just talk about morning coach.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Last question.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   How do you balance the tension between learning more and applying more?
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   You know, again, it goes back to my Sacred Six philosophy.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   So with the Sacred Six, we do not do more than six activities at any one time.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   So if you've got six projects, you can't add anything else to it.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   So you can learn more, but you can't add anything to it.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   So like my team, we have six things that are going, and we have a list, you never know,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   of so many things that are million-dollar ideas, but we can't touch them because we're not ready.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   And I think the biggest issue with most people is they run around doing too many things.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   So the first thing they have to do is get one thing going.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   So it's like one stream of revenue or learn Spanish or something, right?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   So they have one thing, and then they can start to move into more things.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   But, you know, in all the research I've done, and that's why we're writing the book on this,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   you can't have too many things going on.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   Essentialism, one another book that's come out that's really big.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   People are so scattered, and really the problem is it's not time management anymore.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It's not balance. It's focus.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   And it's really learning about focus management.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   I always say time management is so '80s, right?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   It's like nobody should be teaching time management anymore.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   I mean, I literally have one, two, three, the MacBook just came in, four, five, Apple Watch.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   I mean, I have six devices right now.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I'm probably getting bombarded by radiation.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   iPhone 6 Plus, a Mac Pro, a Mac Air, a new MacBook, and an Apple Watch on.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   You know, all this is around me, an iPad.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   And then when I look at my screen, you know, we're doing this as a recording,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   and we're talking to each other.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I've got Skype going. I've got my chat going. I've got HipChat going.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   This is all in my environment, just by looking around.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   You know, so, I mean, the stress comes from lack of focus.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   You know, and it's Stephen Pressfield, who I love.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   A friend, Pressfield's awesome, and everybody should read The War of Art.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Those are things that just add to the resistance of not doing things.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   You just got to get focused in on a few things that you're going to do, a few actionable items every day.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Stick with it.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And, you know, what you'll find, what will happen is you'll start on plan A,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   and you'll have this dream, and you'll start moving it, and it won't work.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   So you go to plan B, and it won't work.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   I'll tell you this. You'll be lucky if it works on A or B.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   You'll go to C, then D happens, then E, then F.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Then, you know, I think morning coaches like T.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   That's where we're at. And, hey, it worked. Oh, my gosh, it's working.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   You know, it's like a par on the golf course or a birdie. Wow, we hit one.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   And that's the way it is.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   And if you get the right support structure around you, you'll eventually get there.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   I made myself a rule that helped me back to that focus management.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   I realized that my skills of focus had significantly atrophied through the last few years with the Internet age.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   There's always something going on.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   And I realized that I wasn't simply able to process information in a linear format as well as I used to.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   So I bought a printer, and I made myself a promise.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   If there's something worth reading, I'm going to print it out, put it on my desk,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   and turn off the computer and sit and read it by hand with a pen and a highlighter in my hand.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   That's helped immeasurably because no matter how awesome Instapaper is
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   and no matter how great reading it on the devices is, there's so many distractions there.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And even though I have most of them turned off, everything just turns into a rabbit trail.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   And that's been hugely helpful to me to rebuild my skills and my muscles of focus.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Well, we're finding not only that in our research,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   that the narrow connection between writing and reading off the computer is actually very strong.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   So much so I'm doing a lot of research with a dip pen.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Kate was in Italy and brought me a dip pen back, and I'm journaling with a dip pen.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   I'm going really old school.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   A fountain pen with a dip, you dip in the ink.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Think Ben Franklin.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   And there's just a connection there.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I actually use a pencil, a number two pencil a lot of times.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   I have a writing coach that helped me with this because I was struggling.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   So a lot of my writing will start with a number two pencil and a yellow pad and then move to the computer
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   because there's a narrow connection between those two.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And yeah, we're moving more and more to computers,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   but I think we're finding people actually moving more offline.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   And I'm actually building a journal that's a paper journal based on the Sacred Six program.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   We're going to build the technology, but we're also building a journal system that's paper and pen.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   And you'll find that for me, I have my Moleskins, and I have a new kind of notebook that I use, and I love them.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   But that doesn't take me away from I just got the new 12-inch MacBook.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   I got it here on my desk that I can carry everywhere in the world and type my notes in.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   But there's still something about being able to write things out that make a big difference.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Yeah, the integration of the two is probably the ultimate.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   That's what's key. Yeah, I mean, I got an Apple Watch on right now, into the phone, into the Evernotes.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   I'm using Dropbox now. I just absolutely love Dropbox because I can see things through.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   I use Scrivener for my writing. I mean, I absolutely love it. I'm a nerd.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   I love the computer. I love the ability to systemize and organize.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   That's why I can play golf every day.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   But at the end of the day, when I sit down and I got to be creative and really connect,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   like something as personal as journaling or something as personal as setting up my day and what I need to do,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   I like to write that down. I don't like a program to send that out to me.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   I'm with you. JV, tell us about Morning Coach, where people can go for information to subscribe and sign up if they're interested.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Yeah, Morning Coach is cool. It's very laid back. We do charge because that's our business.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   I think we're one of the few people that charge for a daily podcast is what it is.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   We call it a coach cast, but it's 20 bucks a month. We do seven days free.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   We've got this wonderful community of people all over. Just go to MorningCoach.com.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   It's a really great group of people, and we're just working to help each other.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   That's what we do. We do two events a year. We do a motivational event in February called Awaken My Life,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   which is really cool, and we have a lot of people come to that.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   In October, we have another one called Lifestyle Design Summit, all based on lifestyle design.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   That's coming up on the 16th and 17th of October at Fort Lauderdale Convention Center.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   It's a cool environment. Anyone who wants to go to that, LifestyleDesignSummit.com.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   That's it. We're pretty chill. Find out about me, Glossinger.com.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   I keep some information up there on things that are going on, my golf game and life.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   People want to find out more about me, that's a good place to look us up.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Thanks for coming on, man. I appreciate it.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   No problem, brother. Glad to be here. Just keep doing what you're doing.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   We need more people out there like you.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Hope you enjoyed that as much as I did.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Always something that you can learn from somebody who's a morning coach.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   The story, just as we close, I just want to emphasize his story about the lady listening in the closet.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   You never know the impact that you can have on somebody else, and it's truly incredible.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   We really do live in an amazing, amazing time.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Take some of the ideas and concepts that JB has, apply them to your own life.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   It's a good promo for entrepreneurship like we've talked a lot about.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   You can just see the benefits of entrepreneurship from JB's story.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Obviously, not easy, but it might be worth it for you.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   Check out some of his links. Check out themorningcoach.com.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Also, let's see, lifestyledesignsummit.com.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   I don't have any kind of an affiliate link for that or anything, so just go to lifestyledesignsummit.com and check that out.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   I actually will be going to that.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   I met JB here. Where I originally met him was at a podcast South Florida meetup here in Fort Lauderdale, and I'll be going to that myself.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   So if any of you want to come, feel free to plan on meeting me and seeing me there in Fort Lauderdale when that event happens.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Thank you, JB, so much for coming on. I really appreciate it.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   And thank you all so much for listening.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   If you benefited from this information, check out JB's stuff, but also I'd be thrilled if you become a patron of the show.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Details of that are at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   The way that works is the show is directly supported by you, the listener.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   You figure out how much this content is worth to you.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Figure out what the amount of money is, the difference that you expect my content to make in your life.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Take 10% of that, trot over to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Put that number in. It literally can be as little as a dollar a month or it can be as much as a couple hundred bucks a month.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   I got some different bribes and benefits for you at different levels, early bird access to the show, access to a private Q&A, which, by the way, that is coming up soon.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   So radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron. Hurry up and get over there. I think the Q&A is next Friday.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   I will be sending out notice to that very soon, radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Thank you all so much for listening. Be back with you soon.
