[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   - You traveled a lot as a solo traveler,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.820]   you just got married, congratulations.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.240]   I've heard you on a couple podcasts say,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.960]   you know, one day maybe there's a family, I have one.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.340]   How do you think that changes?
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.240]   Or, you know, you haven't been through it yet,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.360]   but you've probably met lots of travelers.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.060]   You know, the idea of spending the afternoon
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.880]   kind of sitting in a bar, meeting some astrophysicists,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.920]   going out to a random show,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.960]   is not the kind of experience it's easy to have
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.200]   with, you know, young kids around.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.120]   So, how do you kind of create these interesting experiences
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.340]   when you probably have a tighter schedule?
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.080]   And you, have you thought at all about that
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.360]   or talked to anyone that's done it successfully?
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.000]   - I'd be curious actually from you actually,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.840]   if you've felt, you know, as you've,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.080]   as your travel style has been, has changed,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.920]   how you've felt yourself adapting.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000]   I think what's exciting about traveling with kids
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.980]   and having kids is that you now get to instill
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.440]   that curiosity and that sense of serendipity
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.760]   in someone new, right?
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.320]   And encourage that in someone
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.560]   and have them grow into the kind of traveler
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.500]   that maybe it took you longer to be.
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.680]   And I know that that's much easier said than done
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.280]   when there's like nap time and, you know,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.440]   meal time and all these things
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.080]   that are pretty set in stone when you're traveling.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.440]   But I do wonder if there's not like,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.180]   of course, yeah, you can't be like,
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.920]   peace out partner, I'm gonna go hang out at the bar
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.500]   and meet some astrophysicists, have fun with the kids.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.300]   But I do wonder if there are like micro moments
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.820]   of serendipity that you can create,
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.260]   where you can be like, you know,
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.460]   we're gonna go for, we've rented this car,
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.080]   we're gonna go for a drive on this route
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.920]   that we've researched,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.940]   but we don't know where we're gonna stop yet.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.460]   We don't know where we're gonna have lunch.
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.980]   We don't know where we're gonna go for a little hike.
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.340]   These little things that you just leave open enough
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.300]   so that when you do do it, you're discovering it together.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.980]   You're discovering that moment together.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.440]   You're having that moment of uncertainty
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.340]   and you're like, oh, is this the right place for the hike?
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.460]   Ooh, this looks like a little intense,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.820]   but then you do it together and you're like, wow,
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.820]   we did that, that was crazy.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.100]   Remember when we did that thing?
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.020]   And I think I learned that from my parents too.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.700]   And my parents were very good about doing that.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.540]   I don't, I have like this problem.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.740]   I like, I don't remember a lot of things concretely
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.120]   from my childhood, but I have like vague,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.740]   like more like snapshots.
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.920]   And I have so many like mental snapshots of family trips,
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.580]   of like the car pulled over on the side of the road,
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.380]   the physical map out over the hood of the car
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.140]   while my parents are like tracing our route
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.440]   and trying to figure out where the hell we are
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.540]   and where the hell we're going.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.300]   I have so many memories of us before smartphones,
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.180]   before the internet, pulling into hotels
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.500]   and like knocking on the door and being like,
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.380]   hey, do you have space for five at like 10 o'clock at night?
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.960]   Like my parents did that stuff a lot.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.180]   And I think that they still, of course,
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.100]   their safety was the first priority when we were younger.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.300]   There was all these other needs they had to cater to,
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.560]   but they still kept that little bit of mystery to travel.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.880]   And that little bit of,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.540]   we're kind of gonna make it up as we go along.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.580]   We're gonna improvise a little bit
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.900]   and we're gonna do it together.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.340]   And we're gonna have a conversation about like,
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.800]   ooh, which of these two restaurants looks better?
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.660]   What do you think, little Jimmy?
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.580]   You know, like bring them into it,
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.140]   bring them into that experience.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.780]   So I think there's ways.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.380]   I think, yeah, maybe you can't do it like you used to,
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.780]   fully kind of flying by the seat of your pants.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.540]   But I think in micro moments and through little adjustments
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.360]   and through involving them
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.100]   in your decision-making process as you go,
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.460]   you can still keep that mystery of travel alive.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.300]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.120]   As you were talking,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.520]   I just started thinking about a trip we haven't planned yet,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.460]   but different ways that we would kind of bring it to life
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.300]   with children.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.700]   And our kids are two and two months.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.860]   So, you know, we're not quite old enough
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.540]   to take them on all the adventures,
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.980]   but a few things came to mind.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.620]   One, in the last few, I don't know, months, year,
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.340]   we've met a number of interesting people
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.540]   that live in our neighborhood going to the park.
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.340]   Like just the park down the street from our house,
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.780]   we meet parents almost every time.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.140]   So for some reason,
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.100]   I hadn't thought about it until you were talking,
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.100]   but I feel like we could just,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.340]   if you want to meet random stranger,
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.800]   instead of doing it at the bar
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.940]   where you're sitting having a drink,
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.900]   which might be, you know, the solo traveler,
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.420]   you know, place of choice,
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.620]   you could also just go to a park.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.880]   You probably meet other parents.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.260]   They probably have other kids your same age.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.620]   You could make that your place
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.980]   to serendipitously strike up a conversation.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.740]   So that was one that came to mind.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.620]   Another thing that I think every person I know
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.660]   that seems to have unlocked travel
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.700]   one level beyond with children does
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.500]   is they all contact their hotel in advance
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.640]   or wherever they're staying
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.500]   and try to find some trusted source of childcare
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.620]   that can, not for the entire trip,
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.940]   but maybe help out one night
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.220]   so the parents can go out
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.900]   and have that kind of interesting, unique adventure
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.100]   of just walking down the street,
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.300]   finding a place to eat, et cetera.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.140]   - Another way to do that,
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.660]   and I know I have some friends with kids
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.500]   who have taken this route as well,
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.660]   is traveling with another family
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.700]   or another two families that are friends of yours
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.100]   with kids the same age.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.860]   Then like you either can kind of rotate
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.460]   who's in charge of the kids that night
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.300]   while the others go out to a show or dinner
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.260]   or to meet people or whatever else,
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.100]   or you all kind of pull your money together
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.700]   while you're hanging out in France for some childcare
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.260]   that can take care of the kids one of the nights
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.740]   or two of the nights or whatever,
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.420]   and that way you're doing it together
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.920]   and it's a little easier.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.500]   So I know some people who have gone that route too,
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.420]   and I think that's a great, great way to tackle it as well.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.380]   - The last one that I'm really excited about,
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.260]   and Japan hasn't opened the borders yet,
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.620]   but I'm a big fan.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.660]   We've been a few times.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.880]   It's like re-experiencing the places
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.020]   that you know a little bit, right?
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.740]   Like I've never lived in Japan.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.140]   I've been three or four times.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.900]   I wouldn't consider myself an expert,
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.220]   but I do feel like I know it well enough
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.100]   to make it easier to kind of wander the streets
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.500]   and have a serendipitous experience
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.540]   than I would if I'd gone to Uzbekistan,
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.860]   which I've never been to,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.460]   and I feel like I would be trying to get my bearings
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.180]   as well as lead the family
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.540]   through the public transportation.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.460]   So one thing I'm excited about
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.620]   is just going to places I've been
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.560]   to kind of share that experience
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.020]   and make it a little easier, right?
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.700]   Like the first trip with two kids running around a city,
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.540]   probably nice if you'd go to a place you know.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.980]   Maybe you even test it out locally.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.740]   Maybe we go to New York for a long weekend
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.340]   'cause it's like I know that city even better.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.300]   You know, we've already tested it in San Francisco.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.380]   You know, we take the Caltrain.
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.040]   We actually throw our bikes on the Caltrain,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.060]   ride the Caltrain up to San Francisco,
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.900]   bike around, and then come back.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.320]   So like we're trying to get a feeling
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.660]   for what it's like to adventure in a city.
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.140]   You know, we have our own travel training wheels
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.860]   as new parents that we're kind of trying to take off
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.380]   before we take a big adventure.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.680]   - But also like what a fun thing to like see a place
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.140]   that you thought you knew well,
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.700]   like to see it anew through the eyes
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.860]   of someone else too, right?
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.180]   Like I think that's why people love taking friends
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.420]   to places that they love or whatever.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.500]   I'm in the middle of planning a bachelor party
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.660]   for friends of mine, and I'm really excited
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.180]   that they've chosen New Orleans,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.820]   which is like a city that like I love so much.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.260]   And now I'm gonna be able to like see it anew
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.020]   through their eyes, seeing it for the first time
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.360]   and go to all the restaurants that I love
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.660]   and all the bars that I love and do all these things.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.100]   And I think that's just like such a fun thing to do.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.720]   I can imagine with kids too, to like see them
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.480]   get excited about something that maybe you've taken
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.980]   for granted by the fourth or fifth visit.
