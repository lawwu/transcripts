[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:22.880]   The business proposition of radical personal finance is very simple. Works like this. I create
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.280]   great media that gives you ideas and inspiration on various ways that you can save a bunch of money
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.880]   and pile it up and become wealthy in every area of life. I do that first in advance and then you
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.840]   voluntarily just send me some of the money that you've saved because of the ideas and the tips
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:50.400]   and the tools and the tactics in this show. Simple. For details go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:58.000]   Today on the show let's dig into one of the most hotly debated topics of personal finance.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.840]   Should I buy a used car or a new car?
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:24.880]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.360]   and this is the show where we dig into all of the most hotly debated topics.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.720]   We just don't do it every single day. And today let's talk about those car things. People have
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.760]   very strong opinions and are very entrenched on both sides of this issue. I'm going to try to
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.840]   unpack it a little bit and give you a very simple framework for how to consider it so that you can
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:54.720]   make a wise decision for yourself. If this is your first introduction to the show, one of the
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.320]   things that you need to know about this show is that I don't tell you what to do. I give you ways
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.880]   for thinking about what you should do and then you decide what to do. That fits in line with my values
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.320]   and the way I like to approach life and so that's why I do it. So today is going to be no different.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.760]   I'm not going to tell you buy a used car or buy a new car and here's why. Rather I'm going to discuss
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.120]   the decision, talk about the things that I think you need to be aware of and then from there it's
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.280]   up to you. But let's start with this. Let's start with instead of talking about it from the
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.000]   perspective of a car, let's pretend it's something else. Now it can be just about anything else that
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.760]   we want to talk about. It can be a piece of clothing that you're buying. It can be a tractor
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.480]   that you're buying. That's actually the example I'm going to use because it's kind of a fun one
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.120]   because very few of you go out and look for tractors. But my point is that the car is not
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.280]   this somehow special decision. The reason it gets so much attention and so much press and so much
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.360]   publicity as a big important personal finance decision is because it's usually a big decision
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.280]   as far as dollar amounts involved. Anytime there's a big decision, there's a potential for
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.680]   big mistakes and also big – what's the opposite of mistakes? Good big benefits. We'll go with that.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.560]   Big dollar items matter is the point. So for most people, the number one thing that we spend money
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.600]   on is taxes and that takes up more of our budget than anything else. That's why I spend so much
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.240]   time on taxes. Number two is usually housing. For most of us, we spend a lot of money on housing.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.280]   That's why there's so much written about when to buy houses and how to buy houses and when not to
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.760]   buy houses. Third thing is transportation. Now it doesn't necessarily have to be that way.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.560]   You don't necessarily have to spend a ton of money on transportation. But generally,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.320]   at least in the US-American culture, we do. The US-American culture is the culture of the
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.280]   automobile. So if any of you non-US-American listeners are wondering like why do American
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   finance people spend so much time on this, it's because the United States of America,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.920]   we have a culture that's built around the car. Our country is very spread out. We have a culture
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.640]   that comes from driving. Driving is a rite of passage for young people where you transition
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.120]   from childhood to adulthood and you have your freedom. We in many ways as a culture worship
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.040]   the automobile. So that's – it's not the same throughout the world but in this culture, it is.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.560]   That's why there's so much content. But what I have to share with you is applicable no matter
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.080]   where you live. But let's talk about not buying a car because there's simply too much emotion
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.320]   associated with buying a car. Let's talk about buying a tractor.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.600]   Now, for a tiny percentage of you, by my best estimate, three of you,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.440]   there is actually a lot of emotion associated with the idea of your buying a tractor.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.400]   But for the vast majority of you, it's not something that you've considered. But let
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.720]   me paint this picture for you and let's talk about how you would approach buying a tractor.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.720]   Now, for all but the three of you who are committed to the myth and mythology of the
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.920]   beautiful bright red tractor, the beautiful bright green with yellow trim tractor, beautiful yellow
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.960]   tractor, whichever brand you prefer or blue, those are the four major ones that come to mind that I
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.160]   see out in the fields when I travel through farm country. But for those of you, you might have some
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.680]   baggage associated. Most of us don't have any baggage that's associated with a tractor.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.160]   So pretend I come to you as a farmer and I'm saying I think I need a tractor.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.280]   And I start listing off what I need in a tractor. How would you advise me
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.200]   in that scenario? What would you tell me that I needed?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.680]   So let me play just some fun little examples here to hopefully make you think. Let's assume that I
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.600]   am operating a small half-acre garden plot. I have an urban farm. It's a good example. I have
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.480]   an urban farm. And I come to you and I say, "Listen, I was down at the John Deere dealership
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.800]   this weekend and I saw just the most beautiful John Deere tractor. This thing was awesome. It
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.840]   had 800 horsepower. It has a total of eight tires. The tires are 68 inches in diameter and there's
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.280]   eight of them total so I don't get stuck in the field. And this thing can haul three implements
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.920]   all at the same time and I can put across a 30-foot..." I'm not good enough making these
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.840]   examples up. So those of you who actually know are making fun of me right now, but let me keep
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   trying. "I can put in place a 60-bottom plow. It's 120-feet wide plow. I can get this tractor
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:43.040]   and I can plow my entire half-acre urban farm plot in about three minutes." And I got to tell you
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.960]   about this thing. After all, this thing, it's got air conditioning, it's got leather seats,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.000]   it's got an air suspension in the seat, it's got a GPS built in so I can just simply click the
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.800]   buttons in the GPS and allow it to... The tractor will drive itself. It's got a TV screen there. I
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.880]   can sit there and I can watch satellite TV. And yeah, I need to be in the cab, but I can watch
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:12.560]   satellite TV while I'm cruising down my half-acre garden strip in comfort. It's an utterly ridiculous
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:20.480]   scenario, isn't it? But do you see the parallels to what we do with cars? You would look at me if
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.480]   I were all hot and bothered about the fact that I had this big, giant John Deere tractor and you
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.520]   would say, "Come on, man. What's wrong with you?" But if I were coming to you and I'm all hot and
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.280]   bothered about this brand-new car that I'm going to buy and somehow it's going to enhance my
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.480]   self-image, you would look at me and say, "Well, that's normal. After all, driving a nice car is
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:48.320]   important, right?" Now, let's flip my scenario. Let's say that I come to you and I'm running a
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   15,000-acre corn farm in Iowa. I come to you and I say, "I'm running this 15,000-acre corn farm.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:03.280]   We're running a little bit short on our ability to get the corn out in time because the fields are
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.400]   muddy." So what I've done is I pulled out my local classified ad and I was able to find a used lawn
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   tractor from a guy down in Des Moines. So I'm going to drive a few hours into Des Moines with
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.120]   my little pickup truck and I'm going to put this little lawn tractor – you know what I'm talking
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.280]   about, right? Little ride-on lawn mower that people mow their yards with. I'm going to drive
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.200]   down there and I'm going to pick this thing up. It's about nine years old. It's really – but
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.760]   it's in pretty good shape for it being nine years old. I picked it up. I only given the guy $280.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:38.160]   So that's going to solve my problem. A little bit silly, right?
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:45.760]   But yet, haven't you noticed that some people, when they're trying to run a massive operation
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.600]   or it's massively financially profitable, they're trying to nickel and dime and save every last bit
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:59.120]   and buying a rusty old nine-year-old lawn tractor when they need a $180,000 brand-new John Deere?
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.280]   In reality, that's actually what they need. My point is simply to try to reframe this conversation
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.840]   because cars in our culture are a very funny thing. People have such strong opinions and they
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.000]   state them so strongly about this is the right thing to do and here's why. Again, people are so
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.280]   strongly stuck in either side of the camp, in either side of the buy used or buy new camp.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:29.360]   We're very prone to confirmation bias in this scenario. As an example, I personally, me,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.680]   Joshua, I've never purchased a new car or at least I haven't yet. Maybe someday I will,
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.480]   but I never have. I've had pretty good experience with all of the used cars that I've had.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.280]   I've got some data that backs that up, but what happens is I'm very prone because of my good
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.400]   experience, I'm very prone to indulge in a little bit of confirmation bias and say, "Well, here,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.120]   I've made these good decisions. This is right for me, so therefore it should be right for you."
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.800]   I'm very prone to that. Now, on the flip side, I know people who always buy new cars. Then there
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.920]   was that one time where they bought a two-year-old car and it broke on them.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.320]   They're very prone to confirmation bias of their decision as well.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.120]   But yet we've got to look through it a little bit more. We've got to actually understand the
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:19.040]   situation just a little bit deeper. If it helps you, set aside the idea of buying cars and think
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.440]   about buying something else. Think about buying a tractor if you like that example. Think about
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.640]   buying a chariot if you like that example. One of my favorite personal finance books is a book
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.800]   called The Richest Man in Babylon. If you haven't read it, read it. You can find it online for free.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.640]   You can get it in your library. You can buy it online, a paperback. Go to Amazon, use the book.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.520]   I'm sure you can find it for about 10 cents. It's a well-written book. It's really fun. I like it.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.240]   One of the things that I like most about it is the author. I think it was George Clayson
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.080]   is the author. He wrote it from a modern perspective but in a past time period.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.760]   In our modern perspective, we have so much baggage associated with all of our decisions,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.480]   so much baggage associated with the cars that we drive and the houses and the right way to live and
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.600]   the clothes and things like that. He goes back and he takes all of these things that we associate
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.720]   today and he puts them in a historical context. For example, he talks about somebody looking
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:21.680]   jealously and enviously at the brand new chariot to be pulled around town in or somebody buying the
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:28.880]   brand new tunic and robe and paying triple the cost to have the most perfect shade of tunic
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:35.760]   to wear or the new sandals. It makes you laugh because at least for me, not having been in that
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.600]   type of culture, I don't care at all about what color my tunic is or how fancy my sandals are
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.880]   but I do care what type of clothing I wear today and I do care what brand my shoes are.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:56.320]   Interesting. Sometimes it's valuable to look at things from a different perspective.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.360]   Now, when we look at cars, basically this comes down to a financial calculation.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.880]   What is going to be in my best financial interest given my personal situation and giving all of the
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.720]   decision input and criteria that I have in my situation? That's what it comes down to.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:23.280]   Now, I would encourage you, try to think of yourself like a business owner. Pretend you're
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:30.480]   the farmer or whatever business owner or other business owner that you want to figure out and
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.520]   think about your car not as an extension of you but just think about it as something that is useful
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:46.640]   to you in your business, the business of your life. Ask yourself, as the CEO of this corporation,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:53.280]   Joshua Sheets, Incorporated, what advice would I give Joshua Sheets? Well, if you were doing that,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.480]   you would probably sit down and you would write a careful list of your needs, what you actually need.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.440]   You would also make a list of what you actually want
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.680]   and those needs would be different depending on the scenario and the situation that you're in.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.480]   Now, I am going to give you some details on all the different aspects of the costs
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.680]   so that – and give you some tools which – through which no matter what decision you make,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.640]   you can mitigate the cost and lower the cost. But just think about this. Think of the farmer.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.080]   If I've got a half-acre farm, I probably don't even need the lawn tractor but if I need a tractor,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.800]   I need a small basic lawn tractor. It's probably not that big a deal if the lawn
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.240]   tractor breaks down one day a year. Now, flip it around. If I've got a 10,000-acre farm,
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.680]   a lawn tractor doesn't serve my needs. I need that big John Deere and I probably need
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.360]   to make sure that thing is in top shape. But I also have a difference of scale, right? Think
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.960]   about my profit potential on 10,000 acres versus my profit potential on that little tiny plot that
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:03.360]   I'm managing. There's probably a little bit of a difference as far as what percentage of my profit,
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.320]   the actual cost of that equipment is going to be. So when we're making needs and wants and we're
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.560]   making lists of those things, recognize what it is that you need and that you want.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:20.640]   Recognize the scale of the decision. Let me give you an example from my life. So far in my life,
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.280]   I have owned and operated three vehicles. The first vehicle that I owned and operated,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.760]   I bought while I was in college and I bought it from my brother. It was a 1993 Honda Accord.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:37.440]   I bought it with 193,000 miles on it. I paid $2,000 for it. I drove that car for many years.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:44.240]   I don't remember the exact number. I sold it with 315,000 miles on it and a total of $1,200.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.960]   I experienced a total of $800 of depreciation. I think it was over about five years,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.200]   something somewhere in that range, and a lot of miles on it and relatively trouble-free.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:00.320]   I only had one or two major repairs in the range of a couple hundred dollars. Other than that,
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.560]   it was all just normal scheduled maintenance, most expensive of which was swapping out the
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:11.360]   timing belt, but it was a good car to me. At that stage of my life, that was a good decision because
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.160]   I didn't need much car. I needed basic transportation and I'm still in the
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.000]   wealth-building stage of my life. I sold that car when I finally decided that, A,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   it was having a little bit of problems with some oil leaks and I decided I would go ahead and sell
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.480]   it rather than fixing it because I wanted to upgrade a little bit. I needed a car that was
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:36.320]   a little bit more appropriate for my occupation as a financial advisor. I was able to find a 2006
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.880]   Ford Expedition. I've told the story in the recent show with Tom Stanley. What I found with what I
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.280]   needed, my goals for what I needed at that time is I needed a vehicle that was, A, big enough and
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.720]   comfortable for me. It's a real challenge for me with cars. I'm 6'6" and over 300 pounds and I wear
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:59.680]   a size 16 shoes. As much as I love driving small sports cars with manual transmissions, I simply
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.920]   can't do it because to drive them, I have to be barefoot. My feet can't work the pedals. My shoes
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.240]   are too physically large to actually press the accelerator without also pressing the brake,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:15.520]   just the normal shoes that I wear. So I can't buy a small, cheap, manual transmission sports car.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.960]   I can't get into many of the cars, even with the seats all the way back. I remember one of the more
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.400]   disappointing experiences of my life. When I was a kid, I always wanted to have a Dodge Viper. That
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.320]   was my dream sports car. Then one day I was at the Dodge dealership, killing time. I had some time,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.160]   I was waiting and I decided to go look at cars. I've always enjoyed looking at cars at dealerships
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.400]   and they had a Viper on the showroom floor and I tried to get in it. I literally could not get in
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.080]   it. My head was too tight. My shoulders were too big. I couldn't shut the door and my dream was
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:52.800]   dashed. I knew that I would never be able to have a Viper because I couldn't physically fit.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.200]   Same things happen to me with Corvettes. Every time I've driven a Corvette, I've always thought
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.120]   that would be the best car for me as far as that it's a supercar that is very low priced. But man,
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.960]   I can't drive them comfortably. I have to take my shoes off and I can hardly see through the
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:13.680]   windshield because the top of the windshield is staring right at my face. So my dreams of
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.480]   owning and having supercars, I've basically decided that's never going to work for me.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:25.520]   But a big SUV works well for me. Now, it has high expensive gas mileage. It's not cheap to drive as
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   far as the fuel. But on that one, I got a good deal. It was four years old when I bought it
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.560]   and I bought it for less than a third of the new price. So you figure out the depreciation,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.960]   but in four years, it was less than a third of the purchase price. Bought it with almost
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:46.320]   100,000 miles. I think sold it later with $150,000, 150,000 miles. Replaced it with a 2007
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.400]   Hyundai Entourage that I bought for $5,000, the minivan. Bought it for $5,000 and something like
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.440]   160,000 miles. Now, it's at almost 200,000. It's been a great car. It's done a good job.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:04.080]   Did have one expensive repair, but that was not endemic to the car. That was probably due to
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.360]   mechanical error and just kind of a freak set of circumstances. But these vehicles have been good
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.440]   to me. But I have been at this stage of my life, I've been very focused on how can I buy for the
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.760]   least possible money that meets my needs. So the needs that I've tried to fulfill at various times,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.680]   the car needs to be big enough for me. It needs to be comfortable enough for me. It needs to be
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.040]   new enough and fancy enough to not be – when I was a personal financial advisor, to not be
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:35.440]   a negative mark on my image and my reputation. But I also didn't want it to be a negative mark
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:43.920]   from being too fancy. So I was trying to find the gray man vehicle. So I won't go more into that.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.840]   But also I live in a city where it's very easy driving. I have good local networks. I have
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:54.240]   little problems if I have a used car. Because it's a personal vehicle for me, then if the car breaks
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.560]   down, well, all right. I'm out in a little bit of inconvenience for a few days. But that's really
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:03.280]   not that tough. I've got a great family network of vehicles I can borrow. I've got – I live very
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.760]   close to everything. Now at this stage, I work close from home. So that's not a big deal.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:13.680]   Now, what if I were in a different place though? What if I were – well, I want to give one quick
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.840]   calculation and I'll give you some different scenarios on me. The way I look at it, if I were
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:25.440]   doing what many of my peers did, let's say that I went out and I bought a $30,000 vehicle. Well,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   if I were to go and buy a $30,000 vehicle, then each year I would have about $4,500 of depreciation
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.560]   assuming 15%. So in the first few years, I would lose let's say $9,000 in the first two years.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:44.160]   At this stage of my life, I am very much in the wealth building stage. So I run the numbers and
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.000]   I say let's say that I have $9,000. Let's do a quick calculation here. $9,000 today that I save,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.400]   invest it for 30 years, assume 10% interest for a nice round number, $0 into the account. At the
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:06.960]   end of 30 years, that's $157,000. At the end of 40 years, that $9,000 turns into $407,000.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.720]   There are a whole lot of things that I would like to do with $9,000,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.800]   not only having the money tucked aside for 30 or 40 years, but a whole lot of other things I'd
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.200]   rather do today than lose $9,000 of depreciation on a car. So I make different decisions.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.320]   Now, fast forward to the point. Let's assume that I'm 50 years old. I'm a multimillionaire.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.480]   I've got more money than I'm ever going to spend. I'm able to fund all of the financial
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:40.640]   goals that I have and I want to go and buy a fun car. If I'm a multimillionaire, if I go out and
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.600]   buy a brand new Corvette for $100,000, is that going to be a big deal in my financial life?
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.640]   No. My time is much less and so at that stage, if I want to go ahead and waste the money on
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.720]   the depreciation, it's no problem. So I can see different scenarios even in my own life in which
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:05.600]   I would make different decisions. Now, back to the farming example. I've worked with a couple of
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:13.040]   ranchers here in Florida, cattle ranchers and grass farmers and orange farmers. One of the
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.800]   things that's interesting is if you put yourself in the position of a farmer or rancher, you might
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:24.480]   spend a lot more time in your vehicle and the vehicle gets used much more – it gets used a
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.320]   lot more than anything else. Now, can you still buy a used vehicle? Yes. But now we're switching
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.440]   the transition and we're saying how much use is actually going to be put onto it. I remember being
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:43.600]   amazed at a former associate of mine, somebody I worked for in the past. I looked at his pickup
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.160]   truck one time. He was a rancher and I think the thing was four years old and he had almost 300,000
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:55.600]   miles on it. It was insane. The vast majority of that time or much of that time, the vehicle was
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.040]   used in very difficult circumstances, hauling a large heavy trailer with big equipment, things
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   like that. So the vehicle was extremely used. Now, when you put the context of savings,
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.600]   saving $4,000 or $5,000 up front by buying a vehicle that's a year or two old and you compare
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.680]   it to the life cycle of the vehicle of how much and how heavy it's used, it's a rather insignificant
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:25.120]   savings versus the intended purchase. But that's very different than my situation right now.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:36.640]   Understand that. The other thing that you got to understand with vehicles is not all markets are
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:44.000]   the same. We really have a luxury in the United States of America of having an amazing used car
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:52.080]   market with a tremendous supply of much less expensive vehicles that have been very lightly
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.360]   used in comparison to what they could be used in some places of the world. They're at very
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:07.760]   favorable prices and the quality is extremely high. Frankly, the used car market is phenomenal
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.680]   simply because cars have not been used that heavily. We have primarily paved roads in the
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:18.800]   United States of America. Most cars are not beat up that much and we have a culture of steady new
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.480]   car sales. So the reason that people go out and they replace their vehicle every three, four,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:28.720]   five, six years, however long, that leads to the fact that there always being a steady supply of
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:35.120]   used vehicles. But it's not the same everywhere. That's unique to this market. I remember reading
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:40.800]   about vehicles in Africa. There's an awesome, interesting car manufacturer that I keep my eyes
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:48.000]   on called Mobius. I came across it when I was – I like reading adventure stories from overlanders
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.400]   who load their family up in their cars and drive around the world basically. It's something that
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:58.320]   someday I think I'll do. These families – this one – I read the story of this couple that drove
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.800]   across the Congo and they described about the abuse that their vehicle had taken driving across
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.760]   the Congo. The thing was ripped to shreds practically after something like 30 days of travel.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.800]   They were talking about how vehicles in Africa, in that part of Africa were used. Somebody could
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.040]   buy a brand new Land Cruiser or a brand new Land Rover and the thing would be essentially
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:26.000]   demolished after a couple of months of use. It's a little bit of a different decision if you were
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.520]   in a used market like that where vehicles had been used so heavily. So that I don't leave it as an
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.640]   unfinished thought, the example of the Mobius is actually a vehicle that is – there's a founder,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.680]   an English guy who's trying to have this thing built in Africa by Africans for the African
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   context. It's an awesome little rugged SUV that he's creating and it's just very cool. Check it
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.960]   out. Just do a web search for Mobius. But it's very different in that market versus here in
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.880]   Florida where everyone drives on the highways. Think about even going and evaluating buying a
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.240]   pickup truck. Here in West Palm Beach, Florida where I live, the majority of pickup trucks
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:11.280]   are driven purely as status symbols. There's no actual practical usage to them. Go and look at any
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.800]   local fire department and the majority, there are usually about five pickup trucks and one jeep in
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.200]   the parking lot. It's a status symbol. It's a lifestyle choice. So I can find easily a hardly
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.200]   used pickup truck with 100,000 miles on it. It's just been running up and down the highway all day
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:34.400]   and that can be a great vehicle that might fit my needs if I have a need for a pickup truck.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:43.680]   Now compare that to my trying to find a pickup in West Texas and every truck that's got 100,000
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.800]   miles on it has been run up and down a gravel washboard road or been loaded with a cattle
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   trailer on the back of it for 85,000 of those miles. That's a very different market,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:00.960]   very different usage, very different market. Now obviously there would be probably some price
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.280]   differential but my point is you need to understand why do we actually have this market.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.520]   So you can't say, "Well, buy used in every country in the world or in every situation." No.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:16.160]   You've got to say, "What is the actual scenario that I need? What do I actually need and want?"
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:23.920]   And here's the fundamental reality. You want to make sure that you can meet your stated
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:32.960]   needs and wants at the lowest price possible. That's a good decision. Whatever method you find
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.400]   to be able to meet your stated needs and wants at the lowest cost is going to be the best scenario
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.520]   based upon the market that you have. I'm going to talk about times in a minute where markets will
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:50.160]   change and the person who would ordinarily have chosen a used car might find themselves choosing
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.720]   a new car and the person who would ordinarily choose a new car might find themselves choosing
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   a used car. Markets change. The marketplace is based upon supply and demand and you've got to
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:08.800]   figure out where do I make a good choice within this. Now, that being said, I think for many
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:15.600]   people, they seriously should consider always choosing a used car versus a new car. This is
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:23.120]   what's so frustrating why there's such an emphasis on this as personal financial advice because when
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.720]   you look at the fact that very few people are wealthy, very few people are just buying cars
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.520]   out of extra money. Many people, their car is sucking all their money out of their budget.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.320]   And when you have a heart to help people become wealthy, you see the opportunity cost and many
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.960]   people don't see that. We don't teach and train people on opportunity cost. At some point, I need
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.080]   to do an entire show on it. But in simplicity, basically, there's always two costs that are
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.560]   associated with something. There's the cost when you buy something. There's the cost of the price
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.120]   that you pay for and then the opportunity cost is what you could have done with the money
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.960]   or the resource if you hadn't made that choice. So if you choose to go see a movie, your opportunity
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.240]   cost for the movie is what the other decision you could have done – you could have made with the
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.080]   time, the other activity you could have engaged in with that same time. And so what happens is
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:20.160]   oftentimes people aren't clear about their needs and their wants and they don't recognize what
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:26.560]   could be done with the money with the alternative use of the dollar. So when I look at the scenario
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:34.000]   and say, "Well, if I choose to buy a – this is my thinking. I could go and I could buy a brand
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.880]   new minivan for $40,000 or I could buy my minivan for $5,000. That leaves me with $35,000 of
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:46.560]   investment capital. If I did nothing else other than that one decision, the $35,000 of investment
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:53.120]   capital, and if everything else were constant, it's not, but assume it is, $35,000, if I invested
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:00.400]   $35,000 today over my working lifetime of 40 years at 10% interest with no further contributions to
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:07.760]   the account, then I would probably have an extra $1.5 million in 40 years' time when I'm about 70.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:16.800]   That's compelling to me. When my primary need is I need a way to transport my family from location
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.920]   A to location B, that's the need that I have and fit everybody in the car. That's it.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:29.120]   And so I happily will drive the $5,000 vehicle so that I can have an extra $1.5 million. Now,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   that's motivating to me. That may not be motivating to you, but every person, if you go through what's
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.600]   my alternative use of the dollar, let's say that you're making a choice to purchase a used car for
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.880]   $10,000 less than the new car, then the question would be what else would you do with the $10,000?
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:53.920]   So would you rather, young person, would you rather have this cheaper used car and a motorcycle to go
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.920]   with it, or would you rather have the more expensive new car? Or would you rather have
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.160]   the cheaper used car and take a year off and backpack around the world, or would you rather
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:07.920]   have the new car? Or would you rather have this and stay home from work and raise your kids for
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.960]   a year and have a year off with your kids or have the new car? That's the decision that we're making,
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.880]   but we're often not clear and specific about the decision, as long as you're clear and specific
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.760]   about it, because there'd be many people who would say, especially at an older stage with greater
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.920]   wealth, there'd be many people who would say, "You know what? I actually don't have something
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.560]   that I'd rather do with this money. I'd rather have this money and just simply enjoy the new
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.680]   car experience." Then in that case, the new car decision is probably the right one. That could be
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.400]   due to scale, the scale of somebody's wealth, or it could be due to lifespan. They value
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.800]   the experience more than they value the money. If I didn't have a 40-year investment time horizon,
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.320]   my answer would be different. Let me get to some of the actual
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:58.000]   costs and benefits, some of the techniques that you can do that you should consider.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.080]   The key thing to keep in mind, as I said, is the total cost of ownership. What is the total cost
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.600]   of ownership of choice A, and what is the total cost of ownership of choice B, assuming that both
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:15.040]   choices satisfy your needs and wants? That total cost of ownership number is important, because you
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.840]   may find that your total cost of ownership would be lower with new or would be lower with used.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.160]   It's tough to get data on some of these things, though, so let's talk about what actually makes
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:30.080]   an impact. Price makes a big impact. The price that you pay for something matters,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.400]   but it's actually not the number that we should be calculating based upon. We should be doing most
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:40.800]   of these calculations based upon the depreciation. Depreciation is something you get very comfortable
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:46.960]   with in the context of running a business ledger, a business accounting system. In personal accounting,
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.040]   we don't often think about it. We don't recognize it. In business, you need to recognize the
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.800]   depreciation every single year, but in personal accounting, we don't usually even think of it.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.760]   Depreciation is very simple. It's the purchase price of the item
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:07.280]   minus the residual value when the item is sold. That's the actual cost of the item in terms of
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:13.600]   upfront pricing. It's not the total price. It's the depreciation price. If I purchase a car,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:20.240]   as an example, for $30,000, my upfront price is $30,000, but if I sell it in five years for $15,000,
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:27.600]   my total cost was $15,000, because the vehicle has $15,000 of residual value remaining.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.640]   It's very important to make those decisions based upon the depreciation,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.400]   because there are many situations in which I could see somebody purchasing a new vehicle
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:44.240]   and buying a vehicle that has a higher residual value
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:54.000]   and maybe other benefits and actually having a lower total depreciation than the alternative
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.960]   used vehicle. Let's assume for a moment that there is a hotly in-demand brand. Here, where I live in
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.840]   South Florida, it would be the Japanese brands, Hondas and Toyotas, and their associated luxury
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:12.480]   brands, Lexus and Acura. Hondas and Toyotas, and to some extent, Nissans, are very popular down
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:21.600]   here. They're especially popular with basically the non-ethnic white South Floridians. I have a
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.480]   lot of friends from the islands. They only drive Toyotas, because those are the vehicles that come
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.800]   or Hondas. Those are the vehicles that are in demand there. I've got a couple of friends from
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:37.760]   Jamaica. It's one of the islands, but they only drive vehicles like that. Down here in South
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.880]   Florida, where we have a high ethnic population of people from the islands, we have a high Spanish
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.600]   population, then those brands are very much in demand. It's hard to find a good deal here
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.600]   on something like a used Honda or Toyota. You got to take that into account.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.440]   Sometimes, you might be better off just simply going and buying a new one.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:03.360]   Usually not, but you can do the calculation. Always factor in what's the actual amount of
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:09.840]   depreciation. You also got to account for all of the other costs and look at it totally,
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.800]   all involved. Another example would be tax costs. What is the sales tax on the purchase price of the
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:21.840]   vehicle? That's a big cost that many people don't think about. The difference between buying a $30,000
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:30.000]   vehicle and a $20,000 vehicle, that's $10,000 in my state, 6%-ish sales tax rate, $600 extra cost.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.920]   You got to factor that in. Also, financing costs. If you're going to finance the vehicle,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.880]   what is the total cost of that financing? Then you have all of the operating costs. You've got
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.680]   the fuel or the energy to put into it. We've got to start changing as electric cars have become
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.640]   more popular. We've got to start changing our vocabulary to talk about the energy cost of
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.800]   operating the vehicle. You've got your maintenance and repairs costs, which is most people's biggest
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:01.360]   fear about used car versus new car. The used car is theoretically going to require more maintenance
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:05.520]   and repairs than the new car, theoretically. You have your insurance costs and then you have other
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:11.120]   ownership costs, so paying for a parking spot or a garage space or fixing up the stereo system or
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:17.920]   buying floor mats. This stuff adds up. Now, the big one though is obviously depreciation. This is
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:27.120]   primarily the biggest difference between a new car and a used car. We always ask the question,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:33.360]   why is there such a difference of the value? Why is there such a depreciation for the new car?
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:42.000]   There are probably many reasons, but very simply, if there's only a tiny difference between a new
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.920]   car and a used car as far as the price, let's say a new car were $30,000 and the used car were $29,000,
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:55.520]   then most people would go ahead and just simply say, "I'll be the first driver. That way I know
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.120]   that everything is taken care of from the beginning. I'll drive the first mile on the car."
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:07.040]   There's got to be a difference to make it worth making to incentivize people to buy the used car,
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:13.520]   but the big one is actually that knowledge. Because there's a difference, the car buying
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:19.200]   transaction is a transaction of an asymmetrical amount of information. The buyer has relatively
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.240]   little information about the quality of the vehicle and the seller has all the information
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:30.240]   about the quality of the vehicle. If the buyer is looking and saying, "Here's a one-year-old car,
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.200]   why is somebody selling a one-year-old car?" The buyer looks at it and says, "Wait a second,
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.000]   what's going on here? What's wrong with this? What's wrong? There's got to be something wrong
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.600]   with the car." Now, so to actually make that sale, then the seller will usually have to say, "Well,
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.640]   I've got an emergency in my family. I've got to unload it because I'm moving," or something like
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   that. But the reason is that there's an asymmetrical amount of information. So if the seller is trying
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.920]   to get rid of the car, then they got to get rid of it quickly. Well, you got to discount the price
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:06.240]   to get rid of it quickly. And so that's why recently purchased cars, whether it's a year,
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:12.720]   two years, three years old, they can be found at a substantial discount. Now, that's a great
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.400]   scenario for you if you'd like to save money. It's not so good for the buyer of the new car.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:22.640]   But it's all about that risk. You're taking a risk when buying a used car and there's more risk than
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.800]   when buying a new car. And then because of the difference in the amount of information,
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:33.840]   then you're in a weaker scenario, weaker position. It's a big deal. That's why there's
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:42.320]   depreciation. It's all about the market. But the key is not to get exclusively focused on the
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:49.280]   purchase price, but rather look at the total cost, factoring in all of those things, factoring in
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:57.440]   everything, and then make your decision based upon that. So the reason the scales tilt so heavily in
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:04.320]   favor of the used cars is we have a large supply of quality used cars in the United States of
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:10.720]   America. That massive supply is driven by the fact that many people choose new cars,
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:15.440]   drive them lightly and then get rid of them, but so you can find good deals. The cars today last
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:22.240]   longer than they ever have. Many people seem to have this impression that vehicle quality is the
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:28.160]   same today as it was in the 1970s where if a car reached 100,000 miles, it was practically used up.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:35.120]   It's not so. And you can find good quantitative evidence demonstrating that it's not so.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.440]   My anecdotal evidence, I've never had a car that had less than – let's see, I guess less than
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.600]   100,000 miles basically and two of mine had over 100 and almost 200,000 when I got them.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:53.200]   Anecdotally, I've had very few repair scenarios that were due to the mileage of the car.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:59.280]   And there are some things that you can do to care for that. And if you talk with people who are
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.880]   garage owners, mechanics, things like that, 200,000 miles is probably pretty normal for
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:10.800]   many cars to be able to get to without some major scenario. Build quality matters completely.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.960]   But add up all of those costs and figure out what the total cost is and then based upon that,
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:22.640]   make your decision. Now, focus on purser's price but also focus on other things while you're making
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:28.160]   the decision. I'll give you a couple of the bits of data when my wife and I chose to buy the minivan
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.760]   that we drive. What I was looking for was looking for a minivan of a certain vintage. And so there
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:39.920]   was in the minivan market, there is a – by the way, minivans, the best vehicle for – probably
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.720]   the best deal of a vehicle for all the benefits put together. I'll save that for another time but
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.840]   they're just great vehicles. But in the minivan marketplace, the Toyotas and the Hondas
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:55.920]   have a premium price associated with them. There is a substantial difference in the pricing.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:03.680]   But there's a substantial discount for the American brands and for the Kia and the Hyundai.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.040]   But based upon the research that I did at the time, the build quality of the Kia and the Hyundai is
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:15.120]   pretty good, pretty good, pretty comparable to the build quality of the Toyota and the Honda.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:21.600]   And so I was able to get a substantial massive discount by going with the second tier of brands
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.480]   and the build quality based upon the research I've been able to find seems to be pretty good.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:32.160]   Now, who knows? I did have one expensive repair and again, that was probably due to mechanic
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   error rather than to the problem of the vehicle. That can happen on any car. So I'm not ready to
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.360]   say that I had a bad experience. So far, it's been pretty good. So there's a substantial discount on
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.200]   the purchase price. But other things that substantially benefited me, the actual cost
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:54.240]   to insure the vehicle was at that time much lower than other comparable vehicles partly due to
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.760]   excellent safety ratings and partly due to the lower replacement costs, so much lower insurance
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   costs. Additionally, because the vehicle was so cheap, I could have much cheaper insurance by not
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.680]   necessarily choosing to put comprehensive insurance on it. I probably wouldn't make that decision if
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.160]   I were buying a fancier, newer one because it would be a bigger deal in my life. I could, if this car
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:24.880]   broke down, I could go and buy a whole other car. I could buy two Hyundais or Kias for the cost of
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.920]   the Honda or Toyota. And so it was no big deal for me to say, "Okay, I can get cheaper insurance
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.440]   costs." I was also able to find a substantial discount because of buying a high mileage vehicle.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.640]   But in my scenario at this point, I don't drive that much. And so to me, that's actually a benefit
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.040]   both ways. If you drive a lot, then driving a high mileage vehicle can be a benefit. And if you don't
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.800]   drive that much, then it can be a benefit. There's a sweet spot somewhere in that curve of usage
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.280]   versus repairs. I don't know where it is. I can't find the date on it, but there is a sweet spot
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:03.600]   there somewhere. So for me, all of those things resulted in a dramatically lower cost. Factor
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:08.560]   these things into your decision-making criteria. Try to estimate your actual costs. And let's start
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:13.840]   with depreciation. Depreciation is almost always going to be your biggest cost. So ways you can
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:20.080]   mitigate depreciation. Number one, buy a less costly vehicle. 20% depreciation on a $40,000
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   vehicle is a loss of $8,000 of value in one year. 20% depreciation on a $20,000 vehicle is a loss
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:35.760]   of $4,000 in one year. In just about any vehicle class, you could find a $20,000 vehicle that's
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:44.240]   just about as good as the $40,000 vehicle. And you can especially find that in things like the SUV
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:50.800]   marketplace, luxury car marketplace. You can find it. So unless you're rich, just buy a little bit
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:59.680]   less car, and built in, you're going to have lower depreciation. This is why the scales tip so heavily
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:06.560]   in the favor of used vehicles. Two or three-year-old vehicle, drop $20,000 in price.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:12.480]   And the reason is because $8,000 of annual depreciation, eight times what? That'd be two
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.960]   and a half. You're down now again, depreciation is always based upon the year. So $40,000.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:25.680]   So let me just explain. So $40,000, pull $8,000 off the price is now 30 $40,000, pull 8,000 off
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:32.800]   the price. That now is down to $32,000. Well, 20% of that is only $6,400 of depreciation. So
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.560]   basically, you buy a three-year-old vehicle for $20,000 versus a new vehicle for $40,000.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:46.080]   You can find a great vehicle, and you're not going to incur $4,000 in one year of maintenance
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:52.320]   costs just because the vehicle is a few years older. So simply by choosing to buy a less costly
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:59.200]   vehicle, you'll have lower depreciation. Another way to cut depreciation costs is get an upfront
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.160]   deal. Now, here's what I mean. It might sound the same as, and it is the same as buy a less costly
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.840]   vehicle, but sometimes you can find an inefficient market, an inefficient market where you can buy a
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:15.200]   deal that you shouldn't be able to find. So you can buy when the timing is advantageous.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.040]   Examples that come to mind, I've watched and paid attention to the hybrid and electric car market.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:26.720]   And a few years ago, the Chevy Volt just was not selling. Now, you couldn't really find a great
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.520]   deal on a used Chevy Volt, but you could find some phenomenal deals on the new Chevy Volts.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.360]   And they were so heavily discounted, especially through their leasing program, which is a show
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:42.000]   for another day. But you could find some deals that were so substantially great that it was a
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.800]   great buy for somebody who was in the marketplace. It wasn't a good enough buy for me because it was
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:52.400]   more car than I needed for my needs. It would have been me buying a $200,000 big fancy tractor
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:57.920]   for my quarter acre farm. But the Chevy Volt had that. The Smart car a couple years ago was that
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:05.040]   way. Right now, as I record this in 2015, March 2015, the Prius is pretty low priced. Gas prices
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.320]   have come down. That has a change in demand. And always remember this, the market does respond to
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.200]   supply and demand. The dealer, the car dealer needs to move their inventory. Inventory that's
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.520]   just sitting on the lot for a long period of time is not making them money. And most of them are
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:25.520]   incurring financing costs for their floor plan. So the market will react to demand. They need to
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.840]   be continually moving inventory. If they're not moving inventory, the salespeople aren't making
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.720]   commissions. If they're not moving inventory, then the dealership is not making money.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:43.200]   So the marketplace does respond to market conditions. The next way to limit depreciation
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.560]   is to buy a vehicle that depreciates at a slower rate than the market average.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:55.040]   How? Well, it could be that the market itself is demonstrating that the vehicle is more in
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.760]   demand. So back to the Prius scenario. A few years ago, I was shopping for one and disclosures and
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.920]   gas prices were high. At that time, people trying to sell a used Prius were sitting pretty. Gas
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:11.360]   prices were through the roof and so the market price of the used vehicle was extremely high.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:17.840]   If you can anticipate that in the long term, it's hard to do. But if you can anticipate it,
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:24.240]   you might be able to do better. Some of the cars that depreciate the lowest, things like Jeeps.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:28.000]   I don't know if you've ever gone out and shopped for a used Jeep, but the prices are extremely high.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.520]   So they depreciate pretty slowly. Novelty cars like Mini Coopers, sometimes things like diesel
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:40.960]   pickup trucks, depending on the gas prices again, is another big deal. So the market might be a
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   limited production market. It might be a luxury car market and you might find a certain type of
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:52.000]   the limited luxury car market that depreciates more slowly. If you go out and you buy a Ferrari
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.560]   Enzo, it's tough to find a substantial discount on a used one versus a new one. It's a unique,
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:03.600]   very small market. Now, if you go buy a Chevy Malibu, man, you can find those things for pennies
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:10.080]   on the dollars all over the place. Shop your market. Another way to limit depreciation is
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.120]   take better care of your vehicle so it depreciates at a slower rate and sells more quickly. Remember,
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:20.080]   any market still has competition. So when you're a seller of a car, your car is in competition
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.920]   against all of the other cars currently for sale. And if you can demonstrate a superior product,
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:32.400]   maybe you can mitigate the fear that a buyer has about their lack of information, back to that
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.160]   asymmetrical amount of information. Maybe you can save all of your maintenance records, have them
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:41.280]   carefully organized from the beginning. Your car can look better. We all know that intuitively,
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.320]   but it's good to actually identify it. And so if you take better care of your vehicle, you'll
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   limit your depreciation. Or you can buy a vehicle and keep it longer. Remember that depreciation is
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:02.400]   always the highest up front. But if you can keep an item for longer, then you can limit and spread
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:10.000]   out the impact of that cost. So even if you buy a new car, keep the car for a very, very long time.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   That's why so many people stay poor from constantly leasing and upgrading new cars,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.760]   because they're always operating a vehicle at the most expensive point. If you buy a new car
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:29.360]   every four years, you're automatically basically kissing goodbye 50 to 70% of the value of the car.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.880]   And you're always operating a vehicle in that most expensive price range.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:39.200]   Even if buying a new vehicle is a decision you made, just keep your car for 15 years.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:46.320]   And the impact of that decision is much lower. And it could, in fact, if the car served the
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.160]   needs for the long period of time, it could in fact be a lower cost than somebody who bought
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.480]   used at two years old and kept the car for six years. I don't know, you have to run the numbers
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.880]   in your scenario. But just always calculate in the purchase price and the residual value.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:04.000]   Now, how can you turbocharge these things? Do all of the above.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.520]   That's the key. You don't ever have to just do one thing. So if you really want to get the best
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:18.080]   deal on a car, then buy a less costly vehicle simply because it's used. Get an upfront deal
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:24.560]   because you're buying at a weird time scenario. Let's say, again, I just focus on gas prices
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:30.240]   because they're very connected to us. But you're buying a used vehicle that's a three-year-old
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.960]   vehicle that's out of favor because of the gas prices. And then you're making sure that you
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:42.000]   choose a vehicle that has a lower overall depreciation rate and you're getting an upfront
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.200]   deal. You're buying from a distressed seller, buying in cash, something like that, buying
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.240]   quickly. And then you take better care of the vehicle and then you drive it for a very long
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:59.360]   time. Well, now you've mitigated your depreciation costs in every area. And that's where your best
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.720]   benefits are going to be. But don't forget about all the other stuff as well. Fuel costs or energy,
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.880]   obviously, the lowest cost to operate a vehicle is going to be better. So one of the things that's
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:14.640]   interesting to me is looking at this from a behavioral perspective. Let's say that my choice
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:23.280]   is between buying a used expensive – I'll just use a used expensive SUV versus a new commuter car.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.880]   And let's say that I have a pride issue that I've got to drive a car that's of a certain fanciness
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.280]   and I'm not willing to drive a used commuter car. So I'm going to buy a new commuter car. If those
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:39.840]   are my choices between A and B, it very well may be that I'll save enough on the used commuter car –
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:46.800]   excuse me, on the new commuter car and gas to justify the fancier car and get a better deal
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:56.160]   over the used SUV. Calculate the total cost. Now, anybody listening to the show is probably – you're
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:02.000]   probably not stuck between those two decisions. And the reality is it's almost never a good idea
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:10.400]   to upgrade a vehicle based upon gas prices alone. You need to have a – either – if you're going
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.600]   to upgrade a vehicle based upon gas prices, you either need to have a level swap or go to a
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:21.520]   cheaper vehicle almost every time. I built a gas calculator years ago in Excel to demonstrate this
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:27.840]   to people and it was from my dad. He was trying to think through – he had a 1995 Chevy van at one
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:35.280]   time which incidentally, other anecdotal evidence for the quality of vehicles in my family, a couple
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:40.320]   of cars that we've had – we have had a couple of Chevy vans, all of which ended up with more than
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:46.320]   200,000 miles on it. We had a Chevy Caprice at one point that was stolen with 327,000 miles on it,
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:53.280]   little cost. Vehicles can simply last is my point on that. But with this van, he was trying to
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:58.640]   calculate based upon his commute, had a low value of the van but very expensive fuel cost, didn't
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.240]   need the van anymore. He was trying to calculate the switch to a more – a fuel-efficient car.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:08.640]   Unless the car were an even swap, I could not make it make financial sense.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:15.360]   I simply couldn't even with this atrocious gas mileage of a large full-size van as compared to
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:20.480]   a commuter car. There's got to be other reasons for it other than fuel and energy. But if you can
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:26.080]   get a vehicle that has lower total lifetime fuel costs, it's going to be better. Now, one of the
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.440]   costs that I do want to include here that most people don't think about would be the cost of
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:39.520]   downtime. The cost of downtime is a major impact or can have a major impact on some decisions
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:46.960]   but probably not yours. People worry about this a lot. If my car breaks down on me,
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:52.640]   I'm going to have a problem with my job. Does it happen? Yes, it does. But you as an individual,
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:58.480]   if you are just simply operating as an individual, the marginal difference of your not missing a day
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.320]   of work or having to work from home for a day or two when the car is in the shop,
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:08.240]   it's probably going to be worth a much lower – it would be a much lower cost than the cost
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:13.760]   of the guaranteed depreciation from buying a new vehicle continually. That may not be the case,
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.840]   however, if the vehicle is an integral part of your ability to create income.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:25.760]   So imagine if you're running a fleet of trucks for let's say a large supermarket chain or for
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:31.920]   a logging company or some scenario in which the vehicles actually make you money. One day of
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:40.160]   downtime, two or three missed loads might have an actual cost to you of – I mean it could be tens
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:46.480]   of thousands of dollars, maybe more. So when you compare the cost of downtime, you've got to
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:53.280]   calculate how to avoid that and that's why you'll see – for example, I noticed down here where I
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:57.520]   live, Publix is the largest and most popular supermarket chain. The Publix trucks, they're
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:01.600]   brand new as I understand it. There's some kind of leasing arrangement. They're almost always
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.440]   brand new. They're in a few years old and then they're leased, they're run and then they're
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:10.720]   slipped out. I'm sure that their accounting team has sat down and has decided that that is the best
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:17.920]   way for them to operate and accomplish what they need to accomplish because the potential cost of
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:23.120]   a load sitting on the side of the road with a broken down truck and a store that is missing
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:28.560]   some of the key ingredients, it's too much of a cost for them. It might be the same for you
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:34.480]   but it's probably only the same for you if you actually have a business that's dependent upon
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:40.560]   that asset to create money. So you need to calculate that, the cost of the downtime.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:48.720]   Understand also other costs such as financing costs. I've never borrowed money for a car. I
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:54.800]   think it's for the most part a silly idea. I can design a few situations in which it
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:55:01.600]   theoretically can make sense but it's almost never a good idea. But if you add that in,
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:08.160]   it can be a substantial increase in the cost, especially if you're at the bottom end of the
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:13.920]   market where you're paying a very high interest cost. Then of course also calculate any other
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:20.400]   maintenance, repairs, trying to estimate that, the insurance costs, the ownership costs.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:26.480]   When you add all these things together, for somebody who is focused on needs,
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.360]   I think that in the market that we live in, the United States of America, you'll almost
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:38.560]   always wind up with a choice of a used vehicle, almost always. There's simply such a flood
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:44.880]   of vehicles that are great quality vehicles at much cheaper prices available in today's world
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:51.280]   that when you start compounding these things, cheaper purchase price, the ability to pay cash
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.800]   instead of finance because of the cheaper purchase price to strip out financing costs,
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.320]   the ability to carry collision insurance only instead of comprehensive insurance so you have
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.400]   lower insurance costs. You have lower ownership costs because you don't have to pay for the
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:08.320]   covered garage to maintain this car. You're happier parking it out on the street. I mean,
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:13.360]   there are so many ways to compound this that almost always the question is what is the best
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:20.720]   financial decision? You're probably going to wind up with a used vehicle. But there may be different
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:28.480]   – there may be unique situations. Like I said, if I were in my former boss's shoes running a ranch
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:34.400]   and putting 300,000 miles on a vehicle in a very short period of time, would I worry too much about
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:40.400]   that year or two of depreciation up front? I wouldn't. I probably wouldn't. You get to a point
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   at which you're making enough money that the scale is not that big a deal. There's a Mercedes
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:51.280]   dealership right near my house. I've met a couple of the sales guys in there and people just trot in
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:58.080]   and trade out the cars once a year just for fun, just to keep current. It leads to an excellent
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:05.200]   used car market for the Mercedes brand down here. The key is figure out what you actually need and
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:12.240]   then look and calculate the total cost. It is hard to find the data. I ran a scenario recently and
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:18.000]   it was with a friend of mine who keeps careful records. This was one of those perfect used car
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.920]   scenarios. It was a Honda Accord. He had done everything. We calculated out and I calculated
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:30.080]   that with his current ownership cost, it was something like $385 a month. It was astounding
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:35.360]   because of the amount of repairs that he'd had on the vehicle. When you compare that to the cost of
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:40.400]   him going out and leasing something cheap and run the numbers on that, if he could find a good deal,
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:46.080]   it was comparable. This is not always a simple decision, which is why there's so much debate
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:50.720]   about it. You actually have to find some data and it's hard to find the good solid data.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:56.000]   It's hard to know in advance. Because you don't know, is this car going to be great and it's a
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.280]   used car and I'm going to run it for 10 years and it's not even going to have a single problem?
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:04.720]   Or is this car going to be a bunch of problems? At the end of the day, you're still guessing
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:11.200]   pretty much. That's what you're doing. Hopefully, you can make an educated guess.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.760]   Hopefully, you can do that. Remember that you might be able to solve some of your needs without
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:24.880]   actually owning a car. I am convinced more than ever after now a few years of my wife and I having
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:31.680]   one car instead of two, that the route that we took of downsizing to one car is a tremendous
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:37.920]   route for many people to consider taking. Even just one of the costs that I always hated was
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:43.200]   all the time spent just sitting on the oil change place, getting your oil changed or a new set of
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:48.800]   tires on two cars. Just going from two to one is a dramatic time savings. Recently, for the first
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:54.720]   time a couple of months ago, I took Uber and Uber, they have an Uber. Uber is active here in my area.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:59.280]   I took Uber. I think for many families, if you're keeping a car for that every now and then scenario,
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:06.560]   go ahead and try the actual cost of using some of the ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.400]   Go ahead and calculate what would be the cost of renting a car for the long over the road trip. Try
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:16.720]   to find a way that would solve it without owning a car. I really believe – just make the comment
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:22.400]   here but many people who are stuck in that two cars because we sometimes need the second one,
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:27.360]   if you just switch to Uber, using Uber as that second time and feel free with doing that,
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:32.560]   you might save enough money to where it's worth dropping from two to one.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:40.160]   Also, recognize the next phase of cars is going to be self-driving and electric and it's here.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.880]   I've said for a while, it's a decade or two. I'm convinced at this point, it's less than a decade
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:50.640]   where it'll be normal within a decade that it'll be normal that a bunch of us have self-driving
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:55.920]   electric cars. That's going to completely change the marketplace. It's going to make deals. It's
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.480]   also going to make more efficiencies. Then when you start compounding these technologies, if you're
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:07.360]   not paying attention to this, do so. It's here. When you compound Uber type of connections with
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:12.800]   self-driving, I think a decade – again, maybe two for this but I think it'll be very normal in the
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.520]   future. We'll pull out our smartphone and when we need to ride somewhere, we'll click a button
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.040]   just like Uber works now. You click a button on your smartphone, you tell it where you need to go
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.160]   and a self-driving taxi is going to pull up. We jump in and it's going to take us and drop us
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.000]   off and that's going to be in many cities. That's going to be the primary way of transportation
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.480]   works. It's not sci-fi. It's here now. Every bit of technology has been created and it's only
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:43.200]   waiting on legislative regulatory changes for it to happen. I want to close this show with a couple
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:50.240]   of topics from the Patreon page. I put out – I try to do this plenty of time in advance but I put
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.880]   out on the Patreon page what the show topic is going to be for tomorrow and I invite people to
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.120]   comment. When I put this show topic out for the patrons of the show, which by the way, if you're
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.400]   not a patron, you can be one. This is one of your benefits. Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron,
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.120]   check out all of the Patreon benefits. You can do this at any level, even a buck a month. I'll
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.280]   share this stuff with you. I got a lot of questions. I want to answer some of these
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.000]   questions specifically. John says, "How do you put a dollar value on the emotions involved when
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.520]   your cheap used car breaks down?" John, it's a great question because I think this is the number
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:30.240]   one reason why people make poor car decisions. You get into a point of stress. Usually, it's because
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.080]   many times the people when they're buying, trying to buy cheap used cars, cheap used cars, cheap used
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.040]   cars, car is breaking, car is breaking. They reach that point of stress and they say, "I've had it.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:46.400]   I just want a car that works." That is a very prime time when it's very possible to make a poor
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:53.200]   decision. Now, I'm not saying it's always a poor decision to buy a new car. It can be a good
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:02:01.600]   decision, but the key is avoiding that stress. I think that's the big one. Try in advance to have
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:08.080]   your plans worked out. Try to stay ahead. A comment that Marcus made on John's comment, he said,
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.160]   "That's why we have three cars. My wife and I have three cars. The good one, hers, the beater,
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.960]   mine, and the old beater, which is the spare. Then they can rotate the cars around if one breaks."
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.120]   That's a good strategy. I think also Uber is a good strategy. Knowing that you have cheap
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:29.200]   transportation can be a workable strategy. Evan talks about buying new with an extended warranty
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.560]   versus buying used as is. Evan, I think that one's so hard to answer. You got to go on the data.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.760]   Here, I would lean heavily on data like sources like Consumer Reports and buying carefully.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:47.680]   All cars are not made equal. It's foolish to compare a cheaply built piece of junk car
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:53.280]   with a well-built quality car. Go with the data. Go with the Consumer Reports data. Go with the
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.760]   other quality data. I think you can make a good decision on the used cars. Again, it's got to be
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.360]   a personal scenario. Peter asks about depreciation. Is it non-linear? What are the average percentages
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.920]   or anything else that comes to mind on depreciation? Peter, depreciation, it's hard to measure because
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.040]   it's individual to the actual car. It's also individual until you actually go out and figure
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.280]   out what the sale is. Oftentimes, how do you calculate your actual depreciation when you
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.320]   sell the car if you have to go and differentiate a dealer price and a private party price?
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.400]   The numbers that I've seen is generally pretty consistent. The first year depreciation is
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.760]   somewhere between 20% to 25%, maybe 20% to 30% depending on the car. It could be less for some
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:41.920]   other cars and then basically about 15% to 20% per year. I usually use in my mind 15% per year as the
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.040]   number that I go based upon but it varies depending on the car. If you go out and search, you can find
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.160]   some cars that have low depreciation like I've mentioned, some of the Japanese brands and also
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:57.520]   things like Jeeps. Of course, other costs as well. It's going to cost you a lot more to be driving a
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.720]   Jeep every day than a Toyota Corolla. J.Y. says, "What about electric vehicles negating much of
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:08.640]   the maintenance of the Rube Goldberg contraption we call modern internal combustion engines?" I
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.280]   think this is going to be changing dramatically quickly. If you look at how effective the electric
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.680]   cars are now, Tesla changed the game. I'm so thankful for the people that are supporting Tesla
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.440]   and buying their vehicles. They changed the game. In a decade, I think it's going to be very normal
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.520]   that many of us will drive electric vehicles. I've run the prices on them for myself. I've
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.480]   still not gotten to the point where it's worth it for me to go with an electric vehicle but I
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:42.320]   think for many people, it will be. If I were at a different phase of my wealth building journey,
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.400]   if I had the money and I just wanted to simply support it, I would probably make a choice to
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.440]   support. I'd have something like a Tesla to make a choice to support it. The future is bright.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.760]   You look at some of the stuff that's done, some of the research that's done with vehicles that
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.400]   can run over a thousand miles on a gallon of fuel. Now, of course, these are super slow,
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.720]   super light vehicles but there's some amazing research that's being done and there's no reason
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.120]   for us to have the atrocious performance that we have now. We recognize the market hasn't demanded
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.000]   it in the past. People are demanding it now. Car manufacturers are filling the market.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.800]   Rocky asks, "Does your used car have to be cheap? We bought an almost new Yukon and saved over
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.240]   $10,000. I put a warranty on it that'll cover me for seven years." I think no, Rocky. I think for
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:36.080]   me, that is one of the ideal scenarios. If I were wanting to drive a fancier car, I would focus on
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:41.280]   that couple-year-old space, especially if you get one off lease where somebody has just come in and
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.280]   off lease from a good part of the country where you have a few concerns. That's a real sweet spot.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.880]   I think one of the ideal scenarios is when you're a few years into a model year. For example,
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:06:00.000]   on the Yukon, what year was it? I think it was 2007 at which Chevy and GMC changed the badging
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.480]   of those things. If you buy the model year, I think a sweet spot is if you get to something
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:11.760]   like 2010 and then you buy a 2007 or 2008 model year, then your car is still very current. If
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.480]   it's in good condition, it looks very fancy and new until they change the badging in the future.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.200]   You get a substantial discount on the price. You're driving a very fancy current-looking car,
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:28.240]   so you get all the benefits of the image of the fancier car. You get the discount on the used car
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:34.800]   and that stays current for quite a while. For me, that's a big benefit is buying those cars that are
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:40.000]   a couple years old. Now, I'm not at the stage where that's important to me. I'm still at the
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.800]   very beginning wealth-building stage. For me, I would rather have a vehicle that's substantially
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:50.720]   cheaper in order to have more money available for other goals. But that changes throughout your
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:56.560]   time, throughout your lifespan. In the beginning, you have more time than money and so you've got
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.760]   to get all your money working for you for later in life. Later in life, you have probably more
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:07.920]   money than time and then you're looking for a different scenario. The key I think has to do
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:13.360]   with the actual marketplace. You have to actually look at your actual marketplace and you have to
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.080]   shop to see what's available. I had a relative recently who was looking for a car and they
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.280]   were shopping the used market and there just simply wasn't a supply of vehicles in the
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.080]   category they were choosing. There was no good supply of quality vehicles in which case,
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:34.400]   chose to buy a new one. Then finally, Carl makes a comment about the quality and recommendations.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.960]   He says here, I'm going to read it just so that you know because he makes a comment that he's in
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.120]   the industry. "Assuming one is not wealthy and is looking to get there and/or minimize debt,
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.040]   I can't see a reason to buy new. Consumer Reports is a good source for ratings and
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.080]   recommendations on used cars. After five years, two-thirds of the depreciation has been incurred.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.440]   Cars are better quality than ever. 200,000 miles is a lot versus 100,000 miles 30 years ago.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:02.560]   My opinion is a result of 30 years of buying used, five to 10 years old, in the car business for the
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.720]   last seven and most importantly, reading Millionaire Next Door. Give a gift to your future
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.280]   self and buy a five-year-old car." Carl, I can't think of a better thing to end on. Hopefully,
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.400]   this has given you some ideas and I agree with Carl's assessments. Hopefully, this gives you a
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.240]   way to think about it. I would encourage you just to look carefully at your own situation.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:25.600]   If you make a list of your needs and your wants and again, remember the concept of opportunity
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.320]   costs and you say, "You know what? I don't care about missing out on the $10,000 of depreciation,"
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:36.800]   or you shop your actual market, make a list of them, make your own decision. But pay attention
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.480]   to where money is flowing out of your life. One of the things that I like about business
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.320]   accounting that I wish we taught in personal accounting and I'm trying to teach it to you now
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.520]   is in business accounting, you always have to account for depreciation.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.920]   If I were running a tractor in a business, every year I would depreciate that tractor and I would
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:09:01.120]   incur a cost from using accrual-based accounting. I would incur a cost of a depreciation cost for
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:07.280]   that tractor and then I would actually be able to see it on my expenses. As an example, if you
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.720]   wanted to replicate this or mimic this in your personal financial accounting, take your personal
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.200]   cash flow statement and figure out how much your vehicle depreciated in value last year.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.800]   So if your vehicle was worth $15,000 at the beginning of the year but now you could probably
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:28.960]   only sell it for $11,000, then account for that with a $4,000 expense of car depreciation. That's
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:35.600]   a much better way to do it than to account for it with purchase price or just monthly payment
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.520]   costs, things like that. Now, it's a little bit clunky to maintain all these statements,
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.440]   so this is primarily more of a mental concept, but recognize that. For me, that's where the
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:51.040]   decision is all about. Recognize that depreciation is guaranteed and so I need to have the car that
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:56.400]   fits what I need and want. Recognize the amazing opportunity that we have in the United States of
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:02.720]   America with a healthy supply of used vehicles, but also recognize that market could change
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.920]   and it does change. So hopefully this gives you a bit of a background. I didn't go too much into
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.320]   leasing versus buying. Someday I'll do a show on the taxes and the cost and the comparisons.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.920]   I'll do a show on how to get a good lease deal because you can get good lease deals,
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.360]   but like anything, you have to negotiate them. I'll do some shows on how to get good deals when
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:24.960]   buying. My list of topics is way too big for me to ever get through them all. Hopefully this was a
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.600]   good introduction to it. Thank you all so much for listening. I appreciate each and every one of you.
