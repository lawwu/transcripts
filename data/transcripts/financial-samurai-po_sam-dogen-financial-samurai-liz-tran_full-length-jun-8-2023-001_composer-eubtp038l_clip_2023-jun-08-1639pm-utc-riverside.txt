[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.600]   Podcast, and in this episode I have Liz Tran with me,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.760]   who is the creator of Reset, an executive coaching company
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.480]   to CEOs and founders, and she is the author of
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.660]   The Karma of Success, Spiritual Strategies
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.880]   to Free Your Inner Genius.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.760]   Welcome Liz, and say hello.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.780]   - Thanks for having me, Sam.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.040]   - No problem, I loved your book, I read it from cover
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.960]   to cover over the course of about four or five days,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.840]   and it was very therapeutic, and I also noted
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.120]   that it seemed like you were also looking for a lot
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.080]   of therapy as well in your life and in your journey,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.600]   so please tell us and the listeners how this book
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.240]   came about, why did you write it,
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.600]   and how everything got started.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.900]   - Yeah, so I have always been a really career-oriented
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.900]   person, so growing up I grew up in a very kind of
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.040]   economically unstable situation, so we grew up in
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.440]   Section 8 housing, which is the low-income housing,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.480]   we were on food stamps at times, I was raised by a single mom
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.640]   and so I just thought to myself, I'm gonna make it,
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.120]   I'm gonna make lots and lots of money,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.500]   this is gonna be my goal, and I thought that since I was,
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.040]   I don't know, like eight years old, I was like,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.540]   I'm gonna make a lot of money, and so I went on this very
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.160]   prescriptive path into tech, and then eventually
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.160]   venture capital, and when I got to age 34,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.000]   I realized that a lot of the content that I had consumed
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.440]   as a voracious reader of career books, voracious reader
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.680]   of trying to figure out how to build a network,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.440]   get ahead, et cetera, and all of it kind of worked
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.340]   on the surface, I mean, it definitely worked,
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.800]   I was an executive at a venture capital firm
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.440]   by the time I was 32, but it wasn't fulfilling
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.640]   in a real way, and I started to feel that impact
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.360]   on my life and my choices and who I felt like
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.160]   I was becoming, and at that time, I was starting
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.600]   to think about having a family, and I was about
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.520]   to get married, and I realized that I had to make a choice
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.880]   about what was most important, and it previously
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.240]   had always been money, and I decided, you know,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.680]   maybe I can do both, maybe I can have both,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.400]   maybe I can make enough money, but also still have my soul,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.600]   and I started my own business, and I went on this journey
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.860]   that had a lot of ups and downs, started a business
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.400]   that was largely in person, and then it was open
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.640]   for about nine months when the pandemic happened,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.320]   had to shut it down, and put about $250,000
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.940]   into that business, it was all my own savings,
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.160]   plus a $100,000 loan, and I was sort of thinking,
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.760]   wow, for someone who worked really hard to make
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   a lot of money, here I am at 34, I don't have any left,
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.680]   I don't have a business, how do I recover?
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.560]   And I went into this process of figuring out
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.160]   a new path to success, and building another business
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.620]   that was right for this world that we live in,
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.080]   this is when I built my executive coaching company,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.720]   and it worked, and what I wanted to do with the book
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.300]   is to present a different path for people,
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.840]   which I think you really understand,
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.240]   because you sort of decided not to do the, you know,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.480]   Goldman, Credit Suisse thing, and then forge your own path,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.320]   and I wanted to give people the permission,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.000]   and also some guidance, with me operating as their coach,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.800]   the way I coach CEOs and founders, but via this book,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.320]   to help them chart out their own unique path,
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.200]   using their intuition, versus, you know,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.280]   just following the things that we are all told
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.360]   that we should do, you know, check this box,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.320]   get this type of job, make this amount of money
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.520]   by the time you're 30 years old, et cetera,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.920]   and it was really funny, because as soon as I loosened
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.480]   the grip on some of these ideas that I had held previously,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.120]   success really flowed for me, so within a year
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.680]   of making this pivot, then I paid back this loan
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.480]   that I owed for $100,000, and paid back all the debt
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.200]   that was on my credit cards, I started making
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.620]   really good money as an executive coach,
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.520]   I bought a house on 22 acres in Connecticut,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.960]   like shortly thereafter, and then I also got this book deal,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.560]   and I felt like, okay, you know, obviously,
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.480]   it wasn't all about the money, but I was able
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.200]   to figure it out, you know, that balance
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.760]   between deep personal meaning, and also being able
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.000]   to kind of take care of your own day-to-day needs.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.760]   - You know, being able to invest $200,000
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.680]   in your own business, and let go or walk away
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.860]   from, I'm assuming, a six-figure job
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.400]   at the venture capital company,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.080]   takes a lot of guts and courage.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.760]   You said you were 32 years old at the time?
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.920]   - I was 32 years old, and I was making
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.200]   about $500,000 a year.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.040]   - Oh, wow.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.600]   - And also, because I was part of the leadership team,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.160]   I had more in carried interest in the firm,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.320]   so I had a piece of the pie, and the idea was,
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   you know, if I stayed for seven or 10 years,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.840]   the funds would return, and I would be, you know,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.600]   millionaire, like many times over,
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.360]   and so that was the promise, and that's what everyone
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.440]   who's still there has happened to them.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.240]   You know, it's like pretty, it's a very successful fund.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.360]   You know, they were one of the early investors
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.160]   in Instagram, and have backed a lot of big companies
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.920]   like Spotify, and Oscar, and Jet, et cetera,
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.640]   so it was a great firm, and walking away was hard,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.320]   because I had always operated, too, from a place
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.200]   where I was really fighting to be seen, I think,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.600]   because, like, I never really felt like I was good enough
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.000]   in a lot of ways, like, I went to public school,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I went to a public university, and then,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.760]   when I came out of college, I sort of had to prove
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.120]   that I was good enough, and so getting this job partially
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.560]   was kind of proof to myself, like, hey, I could do it,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.160]   and then I realized that it was really empty,
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.640]   because the only person that could actually give me
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.200]   that validation was myself.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.640]   You know, like, I had this validation,
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.240]   but I still felt like crap every day.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.000]   - Well, maybe it's partially that you were able to leave,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.120]   because you were able to get that job,
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.480]   able to make that half a million dollar mark,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.000]   so you told yourself, well, you could do it,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.600]   and then, now what, because you've experienced it
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.960]   for one or two, several years, and you're like, okay,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.840]   you've seen it, you won't at least regret
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.120]   not having tried, right?
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.600]   - Yeah, exactly, and also, I looked around at a lot
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.760]   of the people who I knew in the industry,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.880]   and a lot of them were very unhappy,
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.000]   and then seeing that, you know, you kind of take
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.920]   the veneer off of the story, you know,
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.400]   there's so much sort of, you know, lore around venture
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.960]   capital as an industry, and seems like such a fun job,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.760]   which I think it is in a lot of ways, you know,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   people who have a penchant for it really enjoy it,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.320]   but you kind of take the veneer off, and you realize,
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.520]   hey, you know, things are not as sweet as they look,
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.840]   you know, and so being able to see that up close
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.920]   and personal also enabled me to say, hey, you know,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.600]   I'm working with all these people who went to Harvard,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.400]   Stanford, business school, and you know,
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.520]   I felt just as capable as them, and then I also felt like
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.680]   this path makes a lot of people happy,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.440]   but it isn't actually a guarantee,
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.760]   and there are a lot of deeply unhappy people
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.240]   who get caught in this kind of warm blanket
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.080]   of not being able to stay, and I think I sort of was feeling
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.240]   that in myself, I was like, if I stay for another year,
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.880]   I'm gonna stay for another 20 years,
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.800]   and there's so much more I wanna do with my life.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.400]   I'd never actually chosen any work that was about
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.960]   self-expression or about even my own happiness,
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.000]   it was very practical and very much like, okay,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.560]   I'm gonna get into tech because that's where the jobs are,
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.920]   it's 2008, I was like, okay, great,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.480]   I happen to be good at recruiting in HR,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.880]   never loved that, and sort of made my way up,
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.640]   and then I got into venture capital,
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.200]   and I was like, okay, I'm just gonna do the best job I can,
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.040]   and so then at 34, I was able to ask myself,
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.320]   okay, what do I really wanna do,
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.600]   and I think when you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.520]   you do have to have your baseline needs met
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.360]   before you can start to think about creativity
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.160]   and self-actualization, and so I think that's true,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.080]   like getting that job enabled me to say,
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.880]   you know what, I actually don't want this.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.520]   - In your book, you talk about going on
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.400]   this spiritual journey to Asia, I think it was India,
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.720]   when exactly did you go on that journey,
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.160]   and how long were you over there for,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.320]   and what were some of the key things
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.240]   that you learned on the way?
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.900]   - Yeah, it was a year that I was traveling,
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.880]   and I was working concurrently at the same time,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.000]   so I was doing some consulting work for tech companies,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.400]   helping them hire people in different countries,
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.120]   and so I was, like I had saved some money,
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.320]   and so I was partially living off of that,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.080]   but I also was kind of working at the same time on and off,
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.400]   and one period of time where I wasn't working
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.600]   is I went to India, and I did a yoga teacher training
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.480]   at an ashram for a month,
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.680]   and I really didn't have phone or email,
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   and I was totally disconnected,
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.520]   and it was just really a life-changing experience for me,
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.120]   and that's when I started getting into Buddhism,
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.960]   and then throughout the rest of the trip,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.840]   I would visit monasteries,
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.220]   I was constantly reading books about Buddhism.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.920]   This was actually exactly 10 years ago,
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.160]   so I was 28 at the time,
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.320]   and that kicked off kind of a years-long
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.720]   exploration of spirituality.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.840]   I actually grew up Catholic,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.760]   and didn't really care for it,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.080]   'cause it's extremely boring when you're a kid.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.480]   You go to mass, it's like an hour and a half long,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.960]   and I just loved the ideas around Buddhism,
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.200]   and it really resonated with me.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.600]   I was also reading a lot at the time about minimalism,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.920]   and just seeing that I could change my life
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.760]   in a different way,
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.560]   and so after a couple years of doing that,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.400]   I was actually doing consulting work,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.760]   and then whenever I'd save enough money, I'd go travel,
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.240]   and I kind of was into it,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.760]   and I was like, oh, maybe I'll move to Bali,
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.200]   or maybe I'll move to Vietnam,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.960]   where my family's originally from,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.680]   and it was around that time when I was 30
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.280]   that I got this offer from this venture capital firm,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.000]   and so it was sort of a fork in the road
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.240]   of do I pursue my interest in spirituality?
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.280]   (laughs)
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.920]   I was thinking of working as a yoga teacher in Bali,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.760]   where my friend had a studio,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.120]   or do I take this job in venture capital?
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.680]   - In New York City? - I don't know.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.520]   Yeah, in New York City.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.800]   - That's totally a big fork.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.680]   - Totally different, and then I thought,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.380]   okay, you know what, I'm gonna try this thing,
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.440]   because I can always quit if I don't like it,
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.960]   and I'm really glad that I did,
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.120]   because even though it wasn't the end for me,
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.740]   it wasn't the final destination,
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.080]   it was a really important stop on the train
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.000]   to where I'm going.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.880]   - Yeah, I think I definitely wanted to,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.200]   during the global financial crisis,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.000]   think about going to Bali,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.720]   eat, pray, love moment, or Thailand.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.920]   I've always dreamed of that,
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.360]   because I grew up overseas in Asia for 13 years,
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.920]   and it was really fun, but I was only there as a student,
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.720]   and I thought to myself, how fun would it be
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.960]   to actually be there as an adult
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.740]   with actually income to spend?
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.480]   So I'm glad you did that,
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.660]   because I'm assuming that it changed your life,
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.820]   in a sense, and your whole path and trajectory.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.820]   - Yeah, and I wanna do it again.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.940]   When I have a couple of kids,
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.220]   I wanna do it when they're in middle school,
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.180]   because I was just thinking, no one likes middle school,
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.660]   I don't think, I think everyone has a bad experience,
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.020]   and maybe it would be nice to swoop them away
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.980]   and have them travel for a year or two,
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.740]   and try out a bunch of different countries,
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.700]   put them in different schools,
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.340]   so that's kind of my big, long-term on the horizon.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.180]   I don't have any kids yet,
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.400]   but that's kind of the plan for the far term.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.540]   - Right.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.560]   Yeah, I was in middle school when I was traveling a lot.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.960]   I was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.840]   and it was a phenomenal experience.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.680]   Four years in Malaysia, four years in Taiwan before that,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.240]   several years in Japan, Philippines for one year, Zambia.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.260]   I definitely recommend it if you can do it,
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.420]   because it just opens your world,
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.680]   and you meet other people,
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.320]   you learn other cultures and languages.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.720]   I hope more Americans can travel and see the world.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.160]   I think there would be more world peace
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.360]   if there was more travel.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.880]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.040]   I mean, do you think that influenced
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   kind of your unique and unorthodox path
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.800]   of being able to say, like,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.840]   "Hey, you know, I can choose to do a different thing,"
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.200]   because you had seen a lot of different ways
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.900]   of living growing up?
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.740]   - Definitely.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.560]   When I was in Malaysia,
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.120]   I was surrounded by a lot of entrepreneurs,
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.120]   people who, it wasn't just they worked at the government,
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.160]   or they had a day job, they were entrepreneurs.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.800]   One was the creator of the Yo's Drink,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.000]   like these drinks in carton boxes in Asia.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.040]   One did well as a chicken farmer.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.920]   And they drove nice cars, had nice homes in the hills,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.040]   and I was like, "Wow, you can do anything you want."
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.220]   And this was in Malaysia,
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.600]   where there was a bigger dichotomy
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.480]   between the rich and the poor,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.020]   and I knew I didn't wanna be poor,
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.040]   because I saw how some friends lived,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.640]   four people in a studio, for example.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.700]   So it did give me a different perspective
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.100]   and different ways of living,
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.120]   and when I was able to start Financial Samurai in 2009,
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.280]   I was like, "Wow, I actually have the flexibility
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.960]   "to do this anywhere."
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.720]   And so it's interesting.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.200]   I did go travel like crazy for a couple years,
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.400]   and then we had our son in 2017,
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.760]   so we then, we settled down.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.480]   So I'm also waiting for until our daughter,
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.880]   who's three and a half years old now,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.120]   to maybe turn five or six,
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.340]   so she remembers her travels,
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.520]   and then we'll start going on that great journey again.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.800]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.680]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.840]   - It's very different, though.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.120]   When I came to America for high school,
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.120]   it was a big shock, because most people just spoke English,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.920]   and most people had never traveled abroad,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.440]   whereas I was literally traveling
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.760]   every two to four years for 13 years,
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.720]   and it was an adjustment for me,
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   and it felt really boring, frankly, in Northern Virginia,
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.220]   because my parents were working in the Foreign Service.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.220]   - So I'm from Northern Virginia,
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.420]   so I feel like I had the opposite experience of you,
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.340]   where I grew up in this very homogenous place,
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.140]   where not only is everyone sort of the same,
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.460]   everyone's kind of culturally the same,
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.400]   like everyone dresses the same,
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.500]   everyone's parents work for the government
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.900]   in some capacity, right?
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.140]   Like everyone-- - And a contractor.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.220]   - A contractor, everyone lives in a house
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.380]   that was kind of built in the past five, 10 years.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.380]   Like it's very, very normalized.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.420]   Everyone drives a Toyota Camry.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.640]   It's like very normal.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.340]   - That's what we drove. - Everyone's just the same.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.860]   (both laughing)
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.900]   And when I started traveling,
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.260]   it was like the world opened up,
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.660]   and I thought, oh my God,
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.780]   people can live all sorts of different ways.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.300]   Like I can be a different person.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.060]   No one knows who I am here.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.220]   And so it feels like you and I kind of had flip-flop lives.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.320]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.900]   I mean, it sounds like we both kind of lead
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.260]   to a similar destination,
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.120]   and I don't know whether it's better
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.480]   to see the world while you're young
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.200]   or see the world after you've graduated high school
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.040]   or college.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.840]   Either way, I hope just more people see the world.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.200]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.360]   I think because it kind of gives you permission
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.360]   to know that your world can be really different
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.280]   than how you grew up,
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.760]   and I sort of think of adulthood in that way
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.840]   where it's a constant expansion
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.080]   of what your areas of knowledge are.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.000]   You know, you have a very small world when you're small.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.240]   It's just your house and your neighborhood and your school,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.000]   and then it broadens and broadens and broadens.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.680]   And that's actually kind of the point of individualization
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.120]   and becoming an adult in the world
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.000]   is to learn different ways of being.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.960]   So I actually think it's nice for kids to do that
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.480]   when they're younger 'cause you just get that expansion
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.080]   and that muscle sort of earlier.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.120]   And my next book is all about mastering
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.400]   the ability to change, which I call AQ,
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.520]   like your adaptive quotient,
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.760]   which is I think actually more important than IQ these days
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.880]   given how quickly the world is changing.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.120]   I think if you can get kids to use that muscle earlier,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.960]   you know, then they sort of never forget it
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.080]   because it is harder.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.280]   Like I see my friends who, you know,
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.360]   didn't get their passports until they were in their 20s
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.320]   and are taking trips for the first time.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.160]   And it is a little overwhelming for them.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.320]   And not to say that we can't all get that muscle back,
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.000]   but it's nice to have it and just keep using it.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.720]   - So let's talk about your current book,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.840]   The Karma of Success.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.240]   What does success mean to you
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.360]   as a woman in a hustle and bustle New York City?
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.120]   - Yeah, well, okay.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.880]   So this is the way I think about,
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.560]   I mean, it's funny 'cause like I obviously have
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   a very deep spiritual side
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.160]   and this book is a spiritual book,
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.480]   but I'm also probably one of the most pragmatic people
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.760]   that I know and maybe, you know,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.320]   I write about spirituality and I learned about it
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.920]   because you seek the knowledge
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.480]   that you don't currently have
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.640]   or like that which is missing in your life.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.240]   And so for me, success used to mean,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.480]   this is before I had this big transformation,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.760]   this big journey,
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.320]   it used to mean being better or the best
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.600]   compared to the average around you.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.360]   And so in school, that means, you know,
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.440]   getting the best grade.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.160]   You know, I always push myself really hard in school,
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.080]   shining in some way, winning contests, being distinguished.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.440]   And that was actually the way that I thought success was,
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.320]   even when I started working in my 20s,
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.480]   I would think I need to be the best person on my team.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.320]   I need the CEO to know that I'm here
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.560]   at seven o'clock in the morning
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.720]   and like leaving at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   You know, I need to be the hardest working person.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.640]   I need to have prepped more for this presentation
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   than anyone else, right?
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.880]   I need to put more elbow grease in.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.080]   And so I sort of looked at it like that,
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.120]   like, how am I doing against my peers?
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.080]   I always measured, you know,
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.200]   is my apartment nicer than my friend's apartments?
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.800]   You know, do I have a nicer car, this and that.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.000]   And where success has really transformed for me
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.960]   is to stop looking around at the people around me
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.920]   and to stop measuring success as a gauge
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.360]   of how I compare to others.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.240]   And more of, am I fully living up to my greatest potential?
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   And also, am I getting paid the equivalent amount for it?
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.080]   Right?
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.360]   Like at the end of the day,
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.520]   I think money is a really powerful thing.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.400]   And there are lots of people
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.560]   who live in the spiritual world who are like,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.720]   well, if you do what you love,
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.760]   it shouldn't matter if you get paid for it or not
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.680]   'cause it's your soul's calling, it's your work.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.920]   And I actually think the opposite where,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.000]   you know, money is energy exchange.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.800]   And so if you're putting a lot of good energy
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.440]   into the work that you're doing,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.960]   you should get a lot of it coming back to you.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.560]   And so when I think about success,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.640]   it's like, of course, doing the thing that,
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.200]   you know, it feels meaningful, feels challenging for you,
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.040]   but then also, you know, being kind of a shark
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.600]   and pushing in negotiations to get paid what you deserve.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.680]   - Yeah, it sounds like success evolves over time.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.120]   So you were talking about, you know,
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.080]   your earlier definition of success.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.560]   But I guess now, after the book,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.040]   after your own entrepreneurial journey,
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   how would you define success a little bit more precisely?
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.680]   And what is it about these executives
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.560]   who make a lot of money,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.240]   these CEOs who have a lot of success
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.600]   and power, prestige, whatever, what are their problems?
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.520]   What are some of the most common problems
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.840]   they come to you about in terms of, you know,
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.720]   fixing their lives or whatnot?
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.400]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.280]   So I personally feel like success in detail for me
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.200]   is about helping as many people as I can.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.680]   Just because I'm, my personal motivator is altruism.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   I believe there are eight core motivators out there,
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.280]   and everyone has a couple that really pop for them.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.920]   So for instance, you know,
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.120]   a person could be really motivated by impact,
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.800]   which is the idea of like getting real stuff done
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.160]   that is meaningful.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.200]   Someone might be motivated by recognition,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.800]   like having people say you're doing a great job.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.280]   You might be, you know, motivated by affiliation,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.200]   which is the feeling of being part of a community,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.360]   you know, putting that community together.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.320]   So anyway, I think there are eight key motivators.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.800]   And so for my clients,
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.720]   it really depends on what they're motivated by.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   It's funny, some of them do not care at all
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.800]   about recognition, and it's very uncomfortable
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.520]   when I even call out something great that they've did,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.400]   you know, and others really, that is meaningful for them.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.800]   It's like how they register what they did well.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.920]   And with my clients,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.560]   I've had really long-term relationships with them.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.240]   I have seen most of them every week or every other week
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.840]   for like two or three years.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.520]   And so we work together.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.520]   Yeah, it's like very, very long-term.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.120]   And so I actually don't really have a lot of movement
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.040]   on my client roster
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.400]   because people just stay for a really long time.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.480]   Usually it starts off with once a week,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.640]   and then, you know, sometime within the first six months,
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.160]   they move to once every two weeks.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.440]   And what I'm doing to help them feel successful
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.320]   is really first,
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.280]   I'm helping them just get to a good baseline
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.320]   of feeling productive and effective in their life.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.840]   They usually have way too many meetings.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.960]   They're overwhelmed.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.080]   They don't have enough time for deep work,
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.800]   too many direct reports, stressed out,
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.840]   you know, feel like they're not operating at their best.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.480]   And so during that initial period,
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.160]   I just try to take care of a lot of low-hanging fruit
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.320]   and force them to really change their schedule
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.280]   and change their commitments and priorities.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.960]   And that takes some time, you know,
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.400]   you're kind of helping them reframe
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.680]   what they think their day needs to look like.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.520]   And then from there,
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.600]   it's a lot of acute issues that pop up.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.440]   So it might be, you know,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.920]   how do I have this difficult conversation
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.240]   and let go of this executive
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.480]   who I just brought on board three months ago?
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.520]   - Very tough to have those conversations.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.120]   - Yeah, and like even today, in today's world,
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.760]   how do I do this production and force
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.600]   while still maintaining company culture?
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.520]   How do I spend my time
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.200]   between like fundraising and this new product release?
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   And so it's a lot of like very specific issues
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.680]   where they'll come to me with something in mind.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.880]   And then usually during that hour-long conversation,
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.960]   there are a couple other things that pop up too
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.080]   that they may not have even known that was a problem
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.840]   because, you know, their lives are very go, go, go,
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.440]   like checking things off a checklist very quickly.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.400]   And when you're operating at that speed,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.320]   you don't have a lot of time to slow down and think,
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.760]   okay, strategically, am I even doing the right things?
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.560]   I know I'm doing a lot of things,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.440]   but are they the right things?
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.040]   And so I sort of push them to make that time in that space.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.960]   It's sort of the difference of, you know,
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.840]   having a conversation with, you know, your buddy,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.680]   grabbing a beer, you haven't seen each other
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.720]   in like a few months, so you just catch up
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.400]   versus when you get to spend a whole weekend together,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.080]   you can talk about the real stuff.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.200]   And because I see my clients so often,
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.240]   we just almost automatically drop into that space
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.880]   of I'm like, what's really going on?
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.280]   What's really happening?
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.480]   And I'm not an investor and I'm not a peer,
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.880]   you know, I'm not a co-founder, I'm not an employee,
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   I'm actually an objective person
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.000]   who doesn't have my own personal bias that I'm bringing in.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.800]   And so it's a very freeing space for them
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.960]   to be really honest about their problems
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.840]   because it's purely confidential.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.720]   And like, I have no skin in the game, right?
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.640]   Like I'm not on their board,
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.520]   I'm not gonna judge them for it.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.400]   So it's really a beautiful relationship.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.960]   I mean, it's so great to see some of my clients
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.800]   go from their seed stage round of having like two employees
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.880]   to now having over 100 employees
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.480]   and having raised 50 million in funding.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.100]   It's just, it's so nice.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.520]   - No, that's fascinating.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.440]   It sounds like therapy for highly busy and motivated people,
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.080]   which is great.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.240]   I've never had therapy, but I find that writing
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.680]   and actually speaking to people is very therapeutic.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.120]   And sometimes we lean on our partners so often
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.280]   that we can sometimes make them fall down
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.840]   and we need someone else to give us some objective advice.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.720]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.600]   I always say to my clients too,
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.040]   that they should also have a therapist, like not just me,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.200]   'cause we're also doing things like,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.640]   we're like reviewing board decks
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.720]   and we're talking about fundraise strategy
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.320]   and things like that.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.800]   And so it's probably like 25% therapeutic
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.960]   and 75% like we're working through the issues.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.160]   But a lot of times it's like therapy issues that pop up
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.640]   when you're trying to resolve business issues.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.400]   Like if you're having a conflict with someone
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   at your company, then it's probably also stemming
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.600]   from some things that you have going on from your childhood.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.440]   - Yeah.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.260]   (laughing)
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.100]   - You know, we're all that way.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.940]   - Right.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.560]   So listeners who don't believe
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.740]   that negotiating a severance package is possible,
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.440]   you heard it from Liz here first.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.800]   A lot of these managers, CEOs, executives,
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.320]   have a difficult time letting go of people.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.020]   So if you can strategically bring up your issues
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.640]   and make it a win-win scenario where you're willing
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.360]   to stay on at your company to help transition,
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.600]   find your replacement and so forth,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.560]   you are better able to negotiate a severance package
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.200]   than you think to do something else.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.360]   And that's something that I did in 2012.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.400]   You gotta think about win-win scenarios
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.080]   from the manager's point of view,
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.220]   because it is tough being a manager.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.120]   - That is really true.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.720]   I think if you can make your manager's life easier,
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.480]   then they're so much more willing
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.080]   to break the rules for you, which is nice.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.680]   How did you negotiate yours?
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.520]   What was the severance package that you got?
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.100]   What did you do?
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.480]   - So for me, it was in 2012,
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.360]   and I was telling my managers,
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.640]   'cause this was not long after the global financial crisis,
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.720]   and I witnessed many people get let go.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.280]   It was like seven rounds of layoffs,
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.920]   thousands of people got let go.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.600]   But I understood what the severance package entailed.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.280]   It was three weeks of pay per year worked.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   You got all your deferred comp and cash and stock.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.200]   And so at the end of 2011, I thought to myself,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.520]   I don't really wanna do this anymore.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.000]   I was in Santorini, Greece.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.520]   I was drinking a Mithos beer,
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.640]   overlooking the crater on a 78 degree day.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.840]   And I was like, wow, this is a really nice life,
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.400]   and I have financial samurai that I can do some cool stuff
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.200]   on if I was able to focus on it.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.520]   And so I just brought it up with my manager
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.400]   after a terrible bonus for 2011.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.120]   And I said, hey, I know times are difficult.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.800]   I'm thinking about doing something new.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.080]   I'm not gonna go to a competitor.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.240]   I just wanna do something new and take a break.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.720]   Do you mind laying me off instead of laying someone else off?
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.120]   Because I know it's hard for you to lay someone else off.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.800]   And in exchange, I would love to get a severance,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.680]   and I'd love to get all my deferred compensation,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.960]   and I'll train my subordinate,
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.080]   or my employee who I hired years ago,
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.040]   and introduce him to all my clients,
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.440]   and things will be seamless, and things will be good.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.640]   And he thought about it for maybe three or four weeks,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.360]   talked to the HR people, other heads,
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.480]   and he said, sounds good, sounds like a plan.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.960]   And so that's what happened.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.280]   The severance package was the number one catalyst
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.120]   to giving me the courage to leave my job behind at 34.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.920]   And I really hope that more people
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.080]   who are in corporate America,
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.280]   any company, any industry really,
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.320]   has that type of thought process
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.160]   to think about trying to get a nice exit package
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.800]   so you have a financial cushion to do what you want.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.960]   Because most companies, they don't provide pensions anymore.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   There's no, at age 50, you get pension for life.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.320]   It's like less than 14% of companies, I think, have pensions.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.680]   - Yeah, you know what I like about that story
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.320]   is that you were proactive about it too,
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.960]   where you're seeing all these other people,
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.160]   like seven rounds of layoffs,
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.080]   and said, you know, I think a lot of people have paralysis
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.320]   and they just wait, and they're like,
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.840]   okay, well, I'm gonna wait for this decision
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.680]   to happen to me. - No, don't let it
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.520]   happen to me, no.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.880]   - Yeah, you're like, I'm just gonna do this, you know?
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.240]   Like, I'm gonna actually be proactive
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   and then it can happen on my terms.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.720]   - Oh yeah, because on your terms
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.520]   is a very different mentality,
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.400]   because if you get surprised and you get that notification
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.120]   or your services are no longer needed,
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.280]   one, you're gonna feel terrible.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.640]   You're gonna feel like a number,
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.200]   you're gonna feel like, well, what happened to my years
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.220]   of service, don't I mean anything?
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.340]   My life was dedicated to the betterment
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.560]   of this company for so long,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.880]   especially if you've been there, like I was, for 11 years.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.600]   And so if you can be proactive in thinking about
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   a win-win scenario for your employer
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.120]   who wants a motivated employee,
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.200]   who wants to generate more revenue or have more efficiency,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.720]   then you can really benefit your manager.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.480]   Don't just quit and say, see you later, two weeks notice,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.040]   because that puts your colleagues
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.280]   and your manager in a lurch, in a bind,
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.000]   'cause it takes months and months to find someone.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.700]   And then it takes months and months to train someone.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.600]   So really think about being actually less selfish.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.400]   I think quitting is actually a little bit selfish, right?
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.300]   You're thinking about yourself,
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.600]   I don't wanna face the wrath of the manager,
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   I'm just gonna quit over email or text.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.480]   Actually face that wrath, see how you can help,
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.760]   and I think good things can happen.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.080]   - Yeah, you know, when I quit my job in venture capital
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.760]   to start my business, I actually gave them
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.080]   like eight months notice.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.360]   I mean, I quit and they were like,
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.160]   hey, we want you to stay for a year.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.760]   And I was like, okay, I think I can do it,
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.600]   I think I can do it.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.720]   And so I started working on my company simultaneously,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.480]   and I only made it to eight months,
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.340]   but it was still like really, you know, I showed them,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.880]   I was like, you know, I'm willing to do this for you,
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.840]   even though it's pretty hard on me.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.680]   And you know, it was a great transition.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.800]   - Yeah, I think, and you didn't burn any bridges.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.520]   I'm sure they were appreciative.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.000]   Obviously they paid you your salary,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.220]   you were able to fund more of your retirement benefits,
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.280]   have more health benefits.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.040]   And that's the thing, the world is small,
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.160]   even though it seems crazy and big,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.360]   the industries that we walk around in is pretty small.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.680]   Like someone will know you somewhere,
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.600]   and you wanna develop a pretty good relationship,
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.040]   because you never know when you're gonna need help
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.360]   in the future.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.000]   - Yeah, you know, when I quit my job to go traveling,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.760]   this was like 10 years ago when I was 28,
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.480]   and I really didn't like my boss.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.720]   I felt like she was just almost borderline abusive.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.280]   She was so mean, and really just kind of,
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.880]   just really unpredictable.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.360]   And I thought about, you know, quitting and going to HR
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.580]   and saying like, hey, this is a bad working situation.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.880]   But I actually was like, you know what?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   It's a small world.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.340]   I just wanna kind of get out of this on my terms
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.800]   and just like have a good experience.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.640]   And so I just said, you know, I'm gonna go travel,
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.000]   something I've always wanted to do,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.320]   and you know, wish you the best.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.440]   Like, how can I keep helping you and supporting you?
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.800]   Maybe I can like, you know, work part time for you,
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.560]   or just do what I can, help find my replacement.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.600]   So I found my replacement,
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   and then about four or five months into my traveling,
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.120]   my old company, it wasn't my boss,
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.080]   but it was someone else at the company,
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.120]   reached out to me and said, hey,
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.400]   do you wanna do some freelance work for us, consulting?
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.080]   And that was the beginning of this freelance career
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.360]   that I had that I could do while I was traveling.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.800]   And then that career actually was what parlayed me
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   into venture capital,
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.160]   because it was one of my freelance clients,
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.880]   my consulting clients who said, hey,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.800]   I think you'd really get along well with my investors.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.040]   Do you wanna meet them?
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.520]   And so, you know, not burning that bridge,
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.480]   even though I kind of wanted to,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.160]   in a way I really wanted to be angry.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.000]   It actually really worked out.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.820]   - No, that's good.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.720]   I mean, folks, you'll never know when you'll need some help
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.240]   or when you'll need just kind of support.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.520]   I mean, really it's your network
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.200]   that can prod you along the way.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.040]   It's almost like a insurance blanket, an insurance policy.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.640]   If you have a strong network, it's very hard to fail.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.000]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.400]   And you just learn so much from it.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.520]   You know, there's always someone who you can learn from.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.760]   There's always someone who can expand, you know,
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.000]   your understanding of what's happening in the world.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.060]   I mean, I think jobs out there are changing so rapidly
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.780]   and they will continue to because of AI
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.300]   and all the changes that that's causing.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.540]   And so I think, you know,
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.740]   like leaning on network is so much more important
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.840]   than, you know, acquiring the information
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.700]   because, you know, you're gonna be able
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.460]   to get the information faster from people
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.820]   than you will in trends that you're reading,
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.140]   even if you follow all the best sites.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.100]   - Right.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.460]   I wanted to read a passage from your book
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.120]   because I thought it was really true
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.340]   and I want listeners to really think about this.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.020]   And it starts on page 200.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.260]   And the passage is,
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.100]   "Why do we make ourselves feel like winners or losers
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.580]   based on the artificial deadlines we pluck from the sky?
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.660]   Why do we believe that life events are better
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.020]   because they happened before age 30
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.500]   or occurred in tandem with our peers?
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.300]   Who's to say that the plans we create for ourselves
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.260]   are even the ones that will lead to success?
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.940]   There was once a farmer whose fence became damaged,
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.060]   allowing his horse to run away.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.960]   'What bad luck,' his neighbors said.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.040]   Now he'd have no horse to plow his fields.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.800]   His response was, 'We'll see.'
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.720]   A week later, his horse returned home
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.440]   with two other wild horses,
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.080]   who the farmer then successfully tamed.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.700]   'What good luck,' his neighbors explained.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.400]   And again, the farmer simply said, 'We'll see.'
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.080]   Later that month, the farmer's son
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.140]   was riding one of the wild horses
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.780]   when it became frightened and tossed him off.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.520]   The son broke his leg.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.040]   'What bad luck,' the neighbors said,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.480]   knowing the farmer would miss his son's help in the fields.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.720]   And all again, he said, was, 'We'll see.'
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.860]   The next day, military officers visited the village
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.860]   to conscript all the young men into the army.
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.000]   With a broken leg, the son was passed by.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   'What good luck,' the neighbors exclaimed,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.780]   knowing the son would be safe from the dangers of battle.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.640]   And as always, the farmer smiled and said, 'We'll see.'
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.040]   - Why did you choose to include this passage?
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.400]   And what is the lesson learned from this story?
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.600]   - I love this story.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.040]   This is one of my favorite stories.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.600]   And, you know, I read it somewhere
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.820]   in some Buddhist Zen book years ago.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:10.640]   And after I read the story, I started doing this myself,
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.520]   where if something disappointing happened,
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.940]   instead of getting really wrapped up
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.840]   in the vortex of feeling anxious,
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.680]   why did this happen?
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.500]   This is horrible.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.080]   This is so disappointing.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.920]   I would just say, 'We'll see,' right?
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.800]   Because over the long arc of time
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.200]   is when you really see how things will play out.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.840]   You know, obviously there's an immediate effect,
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.280]   an immediate benefit, or immediate harm that's being done,
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.200]   but you don't know how it's actually gonna happen
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.400]   five, 10 years down the road,
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.040]   and what that's gonna mean for you.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.720]   You know, some of my biggest disappointments
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.680]   have turned into the greatest, greatest
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.120]   advantages of my life.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.080]   Like, you know, I remember being
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.900]   around this time when I was about to go traveling,
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.620]   and my mentor said,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.920]   "Hey, you gotta go work at a big tech company
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.800]   "because you've worked at all these small startups,
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.060]   "and you have to really even out your resume.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.180]   "So go to Google, go to Twitter, go to Facebook,"
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.780]   something like that, before Facebook became meta.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.780]   And I tried, you know?
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.820]   I like tapped my whole network.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.940]   I did so many interviews,
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.740]   but I just wasn't the right candidate,
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.500]   which is so funny because I went on to like go work
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.060]   at a very prestigious venture capital firm,
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.020]   but I wasn't what they were looking for,
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.620]   and I couldn't get a job.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.180]   And I was so sad about it.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.600]   And because I was so disappointed,
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.540]   that's when I actually was like,
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.840]   "Fuck, I don't know if I can say that, but F this,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.060]   "I'm gonna go traveling."
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.100]   And that opened up everything for me.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.060]   And so I'm like, "Okay, that's amazing."
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.780]   And then even with, you know,
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.580]   my business having to shut it down during the pandemic,
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.120]   first I thought, "Wow, I just literally invested
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.780]   "a quarter of a million dollars into this business
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.140]   "that poof, it's gone."
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.180]   But now in hindsight, the pandemic allowed me
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.260]   to shut down my business very quietly
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.500]   alongside everyone else who was struggling,
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.340]   and it allowed me to admit
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.540]   that I actually wasn't really having fun
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.380]   running this business.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.860]   It was really stressful,
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.740]   and I didn't like being in person every day.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.100]   I didn't like the work that I was doing,
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.900]   even though I thought it had been my dream.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.140]   And it was the silver lining
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.100]   where I got to build this career now
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.620]   as a writer, a coach, and a speaker.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.220]   And I just wasn't doing that before.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.220]   I didn't have the time to do it.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.660]   I never would have had the time to write a book.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.940]   It's very time-consuming.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.500]   And then when I was underemployed, I was like,
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.080]   "Okay, I'm gonna write this book, finally,
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.860]   "this book I've had in my mind."
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.980]   And I think that's true.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.340]   You know, sometimes we also even think
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.980]   that good things are happening,
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.700]   and it's what we want.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.580]   But later on, we find out that
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.540]   maybe we didn't even actually want it.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.460]   And so I think giving life more of a neutral perspective
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.060]   really helps me be happier.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.940]   And I want to include the story
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.940]   to let people know that if life hasn't gone your way
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.860]   in terms of the timeline you thought
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.520]   or where you thought you'd be,
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.540]   not only is it not over, it doesn't really mean anything.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.380]   Like, nearly, not even nearly,
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.700]   but every single one of my clients
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.700]   who was a very successful entrepreneur
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.620]   has had such crushing defeat and disappointment
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.980]   that people told them, "You should just give up."
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.100]   Like, external people, not even their own dialogue,
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.100]   but other people were like, "Why are you even doing this?"
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.800]   And so I think I wanted to include that
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.260]   so that the readers would know
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.780]   if something happens to you that is disappointing,
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.900]   it's not a knock on who you are,
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.660]   it's literally just kind of the ebbs and flows
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.460]   of the world that we live in, the universe.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.780]   - Yeah.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.820]   When I was reading the story,
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.220]   I remember back to when I was 12 years old
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.220]   and I first started roller skating.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.340]   And there's this one kid, he was so good.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.320]   He was doing these twirls and spins,
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.980]   and I wanted to be like him.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.700]   So I started trying to do the same thing,
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.940]   and I ended up falling on my butt and spraining my elbow.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.660]   You know, I braced myself,
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.780]   and the elbow went the other way it's supposed to.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.380]   And I was thinking to myself, "Oh, that was so painful."
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:48.220]   It was so painful.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.180]   But then I thought to myself,
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.380]   "Well, at least I didn't break my arm."
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.220]   (laughing)
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:56.300]   It was just like a different perspective,
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.060]   because the longer you live,
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.820]   the more good and bad things tend to happen.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:05.580]   So I think owning that neutral outlook is very important.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.860]   In terms of your clients,
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.380]   do you see certain attributes of your clients
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.140]   that are different from the average person
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.620]   for them to become CEOs,
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.660]   to become successful startup founders and all that?
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:25.100]   - Yeah, you know, for the most part,
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.540]   people are very different.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.820]   I work with this personality assessment called the Hogan,
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.540]   and it's this very detailed 26 dimension,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.100]   100 sub dimensions of a person,
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.900]   all scored from zero to 100.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.260]   And people do tend to be all across the spectrum.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.260]   People are motivated by different things.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.900]   They're strong at different things.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.020]   My clients, some of them are highly technical, right?
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:53.020]   They came up through engineering or biology of some sort,
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.980]   right, 'cause they're working in the biosciences.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.980]   And other people are not.
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.180]   They're more on the creative side of things.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.340]   Maybe they came up through marketing
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.340]   or they came up through sales.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.820]   And so the background,
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.500]   like school, where you came from, your family,
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.340]   those are all different.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.140]   I think those things that you see on a resume or on paper,
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.100]   they're all across the board.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.620]   But there are a couple of personality traits
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.500]   that I think are similar.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.500]   One is I think you have to be a little bit of a masochist
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.420]   to become a founder, start your own company.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.180]   I don't know if this resonates with you or not,
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.900]   but you kind of have to be like harder on yourself
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.540]   than anyone else is hard on you
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.500]   because once you start your own thing,
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.060]   you don't have a boss anymore.
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.780]   No one's telling you how you need to do it.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.140]   And so there's this trait where my clients
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.140]   are all pushing themselves harder
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.660]   than any other person could ever push them.
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.100]   And that comes up from different ways.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.580]   Maybe it's the way they were raised
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:49.580]   or just their natural anxiety
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.780]   or even like their natural standards for themselves,
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.340]   but they're all extremely hard on themselves.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.900]   And I sometimes have to even pull it back and say,
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.380]   this is actually starting to be a detriment.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.060]   Like I'm all for you pushing yourself,
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.340]   but it's tipping over the edge.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.460]   So that's the first one.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.780]   I don't know, what do you think about that?
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.420]   Do you see that in yourself?
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.700]   - Yeah, well, I know that because of my time in banking,
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.540]   I worked 60 hours plus a week for 13 years.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.660]   And I did write a really, I guess, controversial,
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.100]   there's a humongous number of comments on this post.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.860]   It's called, are there really people
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.260]   who work 40 hours a week or less
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.740]   and complain why they can't get ahead?
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.860]   So a lot of people were upset at that title,
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.460]   but it was one of those things
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.220]   where I was working 60, 70 hours a week.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.380]   And then I had overheard many conversations
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.380]   about people complaining,
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.740]   how come they couldn't get promoted,
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:45.180]   but they were working like single digit hours a day.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.820]   And I was thinking to myself,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.540]   well, how do you plan to get ahead
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.020]   if all these successful people that you see in the media
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.900]   and all, they're working way more
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.100]   and they're working weekends.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.140]   I mean, it's one thing to be
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.340]   at the same level of intelligence.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.820]   It's another thing to be at a higher level of intelligence
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.420]   and work many more hours.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:09.260]   Because if you work 60 hours a week all year,
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.300]   that's 50% longer than the average 40 hours a week.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.660]   Of course, even if you had the same amount
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.820]   of intelligence and all that,
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.520]   you would probably get more done,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.840]   maybe 50% more a year.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.620]   And then you compound that over 10 years.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.780]   That's a lot of gains.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.220]   So in terms of masochism, no, not really.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.180]   Like I worked in an industry
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.700]   that was really hard and stressful,
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.340]   but in 2012, I wanted a break.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.780]   And so I left because I wanted that break.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.220]   And I did say to myself in 2009,
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.460]   when I started Financial Samurai,
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.420]   I'm gonna publish three posts a week for 10 years in a row.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.020]   And I wanted to do that because it was a challenge.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.140]   And I knew that something good would eventually happen
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.780]   if I stuck with it long enough.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.640]   Because I didn't have any particularly superior intellect
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.020]   or insights, personality.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.220]   I was very average in every way possible,
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.580]   but I knew I could control my work ethic,
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.780]   which I think what most of us can control, our work ethic.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:10.620]   And now it's just, things are kind of the way things are.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.660]   It's like a muscle.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.420]   I just publish three times a week.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.780]   'Cause if you can speak forever, you can write forever.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.380]   And now I'm doing more podcasts
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.920]   because I think it's really fun and exciting.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.240]   And I promised myself that I'm gonna try to last 10 years,
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.100]   coming out with at least one episode a year.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.020]   Why not?
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:26.860]   It'll be fun.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.500]   Who knows what will happen?
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.980]   But you have to be disciplined in regulating your time,
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.020]   especially if you have dependents.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.260]   I have two kids, I gotta take them to school.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.020]   And then I say, well, okay, 9.30 a.m.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.940]   till 10.30 a.m. will be podcast time.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:42.660]   And then 11 a.m. to 12 will be writing time.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.780]   And then three hours will be exercise and relaxing time.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.480]   So I went the different route.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.660]   I decided to do a lifestyle business
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.860]   instead of a venture-backed, investor,
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.420]   big pressure, huge potential business.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.540]   Because the ultimate thing I wanted to optimize for
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.700]   was a better lifestyle.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.140]   - Yeah, I think that's really true.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.820]   That's why I also run a lifestyle business
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.340]   versus starting a venture-backed business.
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.980]   But I do think that there's a similarity
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.140]   where you are setting your own goals, though.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.980]   And they're really ambitious goals.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.220]   And I think that's really important
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.380]   because unless we, working for yourself,
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.760]   whether you're a VC-backed company or you're a solopreneur,
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.260]   no one's gonna set deadlines for you.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.100]   (laughs)
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:31.920]   - No. - And there's always
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.300]   this type of work that is really important,
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.140]   but it's not urgent.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.380]   It doesn't have to happen right away.
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.540]   And it can just get kicked down the road forever.
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.380]   - Yeah, it's procrastinating forever.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.100]   - Kind of like writing a book.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.700]   Like, oh, I'll write it one day, I'll write it one day.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:43.780]   And you're like, I just gotta get it done.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.100]   I gotta get it off my plate.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.180]   And so I think that's really important,
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.860]   is just even just making up urgency
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.580]   and deadlines for yourself.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.140]   And I think the second thing with my clients
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.220]   is that something that they really have in common
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:02.220]   is that they have a hard time working for other people,
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.940]   I guess, is maybe what it is.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.060]   Because it is tough doing a startup, really, really tough,
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.460]   especially before you hit your series A
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.140]   and you don't have product market fit yet.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.860]   And so you kind of have to really dislike
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.020]   working for someone else enough
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:23.660]   to trade that off for the pain and the uncertainty.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.860]   And also it's just hard.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.060]   You literally have to do 10 people's jobs.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.700]   And so I think that's part of it too,
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.900]   where they're like, you know what,
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.300]   this is kind of horrible,
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.580]   but it's better than going back
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.340]   and remembering what it felt like
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:41.340]   to be a staff product manager at this place,
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.180]   you know, whatever it is.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.020]   - Yeah, that's really true.
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.580]   And I think that desire to be free,
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.020]   to be your own boss, increases over time.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.820]   Because when you graduate from high school, college,
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.780]   and you get your first job, you don't know anything.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.700]   So of course you're gonna be more amenable
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.300]   to listening to other adults who are senior to you,
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.620]   so you can learn.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.580]   And at a point when you learn enough
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.820]   and you have enough financial cushion or backing,
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.300]   I think that's when a lot of people generally say,
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.260]   well, let me maybe try to take a leap of faith.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.500]   And then some people will never take that leap of faith,
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.060]   which is fine, 'cause having a day job
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.260]   and having your community and stability
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.220]   of income and benefits is really nice.
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.300]   It's just not something that,
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.180]   I just didn't wanna live with regret
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.420]   on knowing I didn't try something new.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.880]   Because I've always wanted to be entrepreneurial
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.780]   since I was a kid.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.700]   - Yeah, you know, I honestly have a lot of jealousy
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:38.700]   sometimes about people who don't have this real desire
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.580]   to work for yourself, because I've always had that too.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.660]   And it kinda makes life harder in some ways.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.240]   I mean, now my life is really nice and easy,
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.340]   but it was kinda bumpy getting here for a little while,
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:50.860]   as it is for everyone.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.220]   And sometimes I look at people I know who are like,
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.700]   okay, they've been at said really successful company,
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.660]   working in a job there for like 10 years,
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.260]   and now they're an executive, and it's great.
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.700]   And I don't know, it's kinda nice having health benefits.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.220]   It's like nice having, like I won't have maternity leave,
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.940]   like I have to just save up money for myself.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.780]   Like those things are all so nice.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.440]   And so I just think it's like a personality thing.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.020]   I often wish that maybe I was a little bit more by the book,
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.540]   because maybe life would be easier,
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.460]   but I'm very also happy to create a life
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.540]   that feels like it works for me.
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:24.680]   - Right.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.420]   And before I ask you about maternity leave,
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.820]   are there any other attributes of CEOs?
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.340]   You mentioned two, and I think that's,
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.340]   those are the two, those are the two,
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.380]   but anything else you noticed?
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:40.380]   - I think the final thing is you have to have
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.820]   a really good handle on your own ego,
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:47.180]   because you're gonna be wrong a lot of the time,
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.000]   and that's okay.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.780]   You've gotta just be like, okay, I missed on that.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.180]   Here's why.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.020]   That's okay.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.180]   Like I just gotta move forward.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.580]   And I think the interesting balance is that
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:01.420]   you have to be really willing to see yourself very clearly
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.260]   in terms of your shortcomings and your faults,
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.140]   because then you know how to build around those things.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.440]   You have to be honest.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.540]   And at the same time, you also still need to
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.660]   have a pretty sturdy base of confidence.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.820]   And so it's almost like this feeling of,
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.940]   you know what, I'm wrong a lot of the time,
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:20.140]   but at the end of the day, like I'm still a good human being
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.500]   even though I'm good at my job, I'm good at working.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.900]   And so it's that balance of knowing that
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.300]   you're gonna fail and then you just need to fix it
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.980]   and move on, but also not letting it color
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.300]   what you can see for yourself,
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.820]   because when you're in the cycle of having to raise funding
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.980]   every 18 months, you have to go out there every 18 months
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.660]   with lots of progress and convince investors
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.180]   that you are the best in the world.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.860]   And so you have to have that swagger.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.700]   You have to have that confidence.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.780]   - Self-belief.
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:47.600]   - Self-belief.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.660]   And at the same time too,
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.180]   you have to be the most paranoid person at your company
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.980]   that things are gonna go wrong.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:57.980]   You have to hold both unlimited belief in yourself
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:01.060]   and your business, and then also paranoia
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.420]   that you're constantly messing up.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.840]   And that's kind of a hard line to walk,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.980]   but I think my clients do that really well.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:13.820]   - When you speak to these CEOs and startup folks,
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.660]   do you get a sense in general that they are
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.580]   more self-confident than the average person?
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:22.100]   So when you talk to me, can you feel confidence?
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.800]   What are the signals that people display
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.040]   in terms of confidence that you observe?
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:31.660]   - Yeah, so it's interesting because I think a lot of times
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:36.540]   we think confidence in culture is like someone
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.880]   who brags a lot or is very outgoing.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.380]   And I actually don't think that's true.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.180]   I think confidence is actually more inclusive than that.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.460]   A lot of my clients are very, very quiet
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.660]   and they're very shy as well.
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.180]   So because I do work with a lot of people
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.340]   who came up through the technical side of things,
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.340]   so software engineers, et cetera.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:02.060]   And so confidence is actually something more subtle.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.940]   I'm actually an introvert myself.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.460]   I don't really, I spend a lot of time alone.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.300]   (laughs)
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.180]   I'm a coach, but I like just reading and sitting in my room
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.540]   and being quiet, and I don't really like going to parties.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.300]   And so the way I think about confidence
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:19.300]   is that you can't always pick it up on people right away.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.780]   Like if you meet someone for the first time,
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.780]   you won't really know if they're confident,
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:26.380]   but it's sort of how they respond to the situations
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.220]   that come across their plate.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.620]   And like at the end of the day,
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.320]   do they think that they are innately capable?
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.140]   And like when, I think confidence is really when
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.060]   something very surprising and something really disappointing
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.380]   pops into your life, do you let it swirl you up
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.700]   and make you think that you're a horrible person
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:45.900]   and that you messed up?
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.440]   Or does it kind of tether you and ground you
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.580]   and your confidence just says, you know what?
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.880]   It's okay, I'm gonna be fine.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.780]   And so it really just starts to come up for me
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:57.380]   when I see my clients responding to different situations.
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.380]   I don't always pick up on it like a first conversation.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.980]   I can hear it a little bit in how hard they are
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:05.020]   on themselves or the way that they'll narrate
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.820]   something bad that happened to them,
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.620]   but it takes a little while to kind of figure it out.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.660]   And I actually work with a lot of my clients
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.620]   on confidence building exercises,
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.980]   especially right before they go fundraise
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.260]   and during the fundraise process,
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.900]   which is often many months long,
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.580]   we will be really deliberate about contributing
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.940]   to their confidence bank account
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.980]   and trying to get that level up.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.060]   Because it is also variable.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.000]   It can go up and down over time,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.900]   but at the end of the day,
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.740]   we can all adjust it for ourselves.
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.580]   We can work on it.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.460]   - Confidence bank account, I like that.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.740]   That's something I need.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.100]   I need to raise big time before I enter a tennis match.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.340]   (laughing)
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.660]   The pre-match jitters are tough,
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:46.460]   but you have to have in tennis,
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.380]   it's like 60, 70% mental.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.900]   Do you believe you're gonna win?
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.780]   If you do, you're gonna have a greater chance of winning.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.660]   If you don't, then you already defeated yourself.
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.280]   - That's exactly the way it is in life.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.340]   And I love reading about high performance athletes
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:03.220]   like Serena Williams, greatest tennis player ever.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.900]   And Michael Phelps where they build confidence
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.820]   by visualizing themselves winning the game.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.460]   Like Michael Phelps will literally visualize
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.140]   every single stroke in the pool.
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.660]   And so by the time he gets to the race,
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.340]   he already has won it in his head a hundred times.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.940]   And he's like, "Oh, I can do this."
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.660]   So I think the confidence is the same thing.
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.140]   You picture yourself doing it,
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.940]   you picture yourself winning.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.380]   And so then when you get there,
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:30.940]   it doesn't feel so far away.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.100]   - Yeah.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.140]   It's still pre-match jitters, nerves, it's there.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.520]   But yeah, that confidence is so important.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.940]   I wanted to conclude by talking to you about,
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.600]   being a woman in New York City and in your book,
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.020]   I felt like you were going through a balance,
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.500]   a struggle between career and family a lot.
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:59.380]   And I empathize because I regret having kids so late
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.220]   because I was so focused on my career.
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.400]   And it's also expensive here in San Francisco.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.260]   And before San Francisco, I was in New York City.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.780]   So can you tell me about that balance
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.460]   and how do you try to balance it?
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.440]   And how would you encourage other women
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.860]   who are in big expensive cities,
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.780]   who want a career, but who also want a family
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.460]   to balance that situation as well?
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.100]   Can you really have it all?
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:27.060]   And how do you get there if you can?
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.180]   - Yeah, I love that question.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:33.180]   I'm still figuring this out for myself.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:36.820]   It's hard, because I came up
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.500]   through really male dominated industries.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:45.980]   I kind of adopted this way of being that was very much,
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.980]   my career first and everything else comes second.
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:53.260]   And I do have a lot of regret around that.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.500]   Not even just on like the kids front,
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   but I missed a lot of bridal showers, bachelorette parties,
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.260]   even weddings of my close friends
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.980]   when I was in my late 20s and 30s.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.100]   That's when everyone's getting married,
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.120]   but that's also when I was really putting
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.060]   the gas pedal on my career.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:13.100]   And I felt like I was through,
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.700]   until I quit my job at Venture Capital,
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.980]   I was always at the office.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.900]   I was always traveling for work.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.820]   And I wouldn't give a second thought
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.820]   to not seeing my family, my family of origin,
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.700]   my brother, my aunts, not seeing best friends,
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.020]   because I had to drop everything
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.740]   'cause we were trying to close a deal.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.580]   And I do have some regret around that
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:35.260]   because I definitely, I burned some relationships
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.800]   that were hard to repair
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.120]   and some that actually haven't been repaired.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:44.820]   And then now, my husband and I,
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:49.020]   we're both in our late 30s, I'm 38, he's 39.
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.820]   We're just like on the cusp of having our kids,
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.980]   which is really exciting.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.900]   We're gonna have a kid in January.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.020]   - Congratulations.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.940]   - Thank you, I'm really excited.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.140]   - I'm really excited too.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.460]   - I'm so excited.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:03.500]   And do I regret waiting 'til I was 38?
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.100]   I mean, part of it wasn't my choice.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:09.100]   We did two years of IVF and we tried for three years.
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:13.580]   And I think it was just kind of meant to be that way.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.620]   No one could tell us why we weren't getting pregnant.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.440]   It was weird.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.360]   Everyone's like, "You should be fine.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.940]   "You have plenty of eggs, blah, blah, blah."
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.020]   And it still hasn't been explained.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:22.420]   And I think part of it,
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:24.340]   this is gonna be a little woo-woo maybe for people,
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:28.800]   but I don't know if I was actually subconsciously ready
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.140]   because I was so career-focused.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.620]   And it was only in starting to see role models
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.180]   of other women who would say things like,
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.780]   "You know what, kids, that was my breakthrough."
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.820]   A lot of people think that kids hold you back,
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.780]   but the creativity that they bring into your life,
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.380]   the way that you can reprioritize
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.460]   everything that's important,
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.980]   the clarity that you have about who you are,
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.020]   all that stuff makes you better at your career.
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:58.140]   And I remember the night before I had my IVF procedure
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.600]   to hopefully get pregnant,
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.100]   I had my friend over for dinner
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.300]   who's also a career-minded woman, she's writing a book.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.360]   And I said, "Do you ever worry about kids
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.560]   "impacting your career?"
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.060]   And she said, "No, what is a more creative act
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.560]   "than creating life and then raising a child,
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.760]   "getting to figure out what this person's life looks like?"
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:22.800]   She was like, "How could that not make you more, better,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.880]   "more competent, more capable?"
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.600]   And I just started crying.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.720]   And I was like, "Oh my God, you're right.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.800]   "I've been looking at it the wrong way of like,
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.880]   "do I have this or do I have this?"
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.720]   Hey, guess what?
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:34.940]   Actually, maybe you can have both.
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:38.720]   And I think I'm lucky, I have a supportive partner.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.800]   We're gonna have some help.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.080]   You know, not everyone can say that.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.040]   I think I'm very privileged in that way
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.520]   to be able to have a nanny in the future.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:50.920]   And I have enough stability in my career
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.280]   where I can set my own hours and things like that.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.120]   But I do feel like that wasn't available to me
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:01.080]   when I was 35, when I first started trying to have a kid.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.240]   And 38 is late, right?
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.840]   Like you're starting to think, okay, wow,
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.040]   when my kid is getting married herself,
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.560]   I'm gonna be in my 70s.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.520]   You know, and you're like, whoa, that feels like a lot.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.220]   Or like, this kid's gonna graduate from college.
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:14.600]   I'm gonna be like almost 60.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.320]   And you're like, wow.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.640]   But I think it was, you know,
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:20.760]   just like the passage that you read, that was my path.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.000]   And I think I had to reconcile that idea of success
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.560]   and be able to see that, you know,
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.200]   I could do both if I was really creative about it
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.240]   before this kid was like, yeah, okay,
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.440]   I'm gonna come join you.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.200]   - Yeah, it's really tough.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.440]   And I really empathize with women who want that career
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.560]   and who want that family.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.920]   Because I've met many, many women in my time on Wall Street
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.200]   who have told me in their 40s, you know,
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.140]   I wish I spend more time seeking someone
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.560]   or balancing my life a little more.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.000]   And it's hard to have it all.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.740]   I was able to have a kid at, I guess, 37 and 39.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.960]   And that, no, no, no, that was wrong.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   39 and 42.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.320]   That was with my wife, 37, 39.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.520]   And it was just kind of like, oh, we snuck by,
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.160]   it's stuck right in there under 40
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.900]   for at least our first one.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:15.760]   And it's gonna be a great adventure for you.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.720]   You are gonna be tested beyond belief.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.760]   But there's a great saying,
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.560]   have children and the money will come.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.240]   And it's not just so much about the money,
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.920]   it's about being able to have the,
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.720]   unlocking these superpowers where you have more energy,
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.360]   more focus, because you want to do everything
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.980]   for your children.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.960]   So I'm really excited for your journey.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.560]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.120]   My husband's family has a saying,
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.500]   and it's like what you said,
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.960]   and it's the child brings its own bread.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.160]   Which is like, you know, that kid will give you everything
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.180]   that you need to figure out how to like support it
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:50.000]   and make a living for it.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.480]   Yeah, I'm really excited.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.120]   And I'm also very, you know, inspired to know that,
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:58.120]   you know, you had your kids when you had,
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.840]   you know, your career more sorted out
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.280]   and like a little bit later,
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.240]   like I love seeing role models for that.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.160]   And clearly like your kids are happy and great.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.000]   (laughs)
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:07.840]   You know?
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.240]   - Well, I don't know most of the time,
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.520]   but you know, there is a benefit, right?
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.120]   So the negative of having children late
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.280]   is that you will not be in their lives
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.920]   as long as you could have been.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.340]   Right, and that's a big lament.
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:23.400]   However, the great thing about having kids late
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.760]   is you're generally more mature.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.640]   You've done more of the things that you've wanted to do,
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:32.520]   and you're generally more financially stable.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.680]   So after this podcast,
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.560]   I'm gonna take her to the zoo for a couple hours,
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.440]   and we're gonna hang out and go on the choo-choo train,
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:41.760]   you know, and just be one together.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.440]   And so there are pros and cons of everything.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.680]   And for late parents, for older parents,
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.160]   you can actually do the math
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.600]   in terms of how much more time
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.560]   you could actually spend with them as a late parent
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.280]   to actually surpass if you had had them five years,
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.280]   eight years younger.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.480]   You can work it out, and you can kind of catch up.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.440]   So not all is lost.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.600]   - That is actually really true.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   That is so true.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.740]   I never thought about that way
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.240]   of like actually looking at the time
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.400]   that you can physically spend with them.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.720]   So true.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.960]   - So.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.920]   Well, thank you so much, Liz, for being on this podcast.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.440]   It's been a great hour speaking to you.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:21.200]   Can you let the listeners know
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.640]   where we can find the Karma of Success
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   and where we can find you if we want some coaching?
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.560]   - Yeah, so you can find the Karma of Success

[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.520]   Actually, I don't know when this podcast comes out,
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:37.360]   so let me take that back.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.320]   - I'll probably release it around July 25th.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.160]   - Okay, great.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.240]   So you can find it at any bookstore.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.720]   It's everywhere.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.320]   And I recorded the audio book myself,
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.880]   so if you wanna hear more of this voice,

[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.240]   to their greatest potential for their careers.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.320]   - Awesome.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.640]   Well, thanks again, and thanks for coming on.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.680]   - Thank you, Sam.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.180]   - It was such a pleasure.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.340]   - All right, take care.
