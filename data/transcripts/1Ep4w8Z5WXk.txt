[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:15.920]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:38.880]   Psalm 127:1 begins, "Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain."
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.520]   It all starts with and must be centered around the Lord. He is the one who builds the house.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.640]   He is the one with whom our life and work needs to be dedicated to.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.880]   This was the foundational knowledge Pastor John MacArthur knew on February 9, 1969,
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.720]   when he began his work at Grace Community Church. He knew that all he wanted to do was teach the
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.840]   Word of God and let that Word work in the lives of those who heard it. It's been 50 years since
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.280]   that first Sunday, and today you will hear a portion of the special
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.500]   50-minute sermon series on the Gospel of John MacArthur.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.380]   In the sermon series, Pastor John shared about the work of God's Word in his own life and the life of
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.020]   Grace Church. As always, to hear the full message, go to gty.org and search using the sermon title.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.780]   For now, grab your Bible and sit back as our pastor unleashes God's truth, one verse at a time.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:45.260]   In 2 Timothy 3:14, we read the Word of God:
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.940]   "You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of,
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.340]   knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.060]   which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.620]   All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.240]   for correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God, who is the Lord, who is the
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.800]   Lord, may be complete, equipped for every good work. I solemnly charge you in the presence of God
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing in His kingdom,
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:39.560]   preach the Word. Be ready in season and out of season. Reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.000]   and instruction." Let me stop there and say that verse 2 has been my life of the day.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.080]   It's a lifelong mandate. Preach the Word. Preach the Word in season and out of season.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.400]   That means all the time, and that is what I have endeavored to do.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.040]   I come into this pulpit on a Sunday, and through these years I've preached two or three and
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.720]   sometimes four times on a Sunday. In the early years, again on Wednesday, other times throughout
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.160]   this half a century I have preached across this country and pretty much around the world.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:28.200]   And always I have preached the Word. Always I have opened the Word of God. I have really nothing to
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.840]   say of significance on my own. I stand solemnly charged or commanded in the presence of God and
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and that includes me, by His appearing in
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.480]   His kingdom. And I have been commanded to preach the Word. So I have endeavored to do that to the
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.800]   best of my ability. The story of this church is not the story of a man. It's not the result of
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:06.840]   the work of a man. It isn't the work of many men and many women that is the record of this church,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.360]   to be told. It really is the story of the work of the Word of God through the Spirit of God.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.600]   As Martin Luther said, "I did nothing, the Word did everything."
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:24.520]   The Scripture has dominated the pulpits and lecterns and classrooms and conversations and
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.400]   homes and lives of this congregation for half a century.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.720]   And we have experienced the reality of Isaiah's words, "For as the rain and the snow come down
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.280]   from heaven and do not return there without watering the earth and making it barren,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.240]   sprout and furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so will my word be which goes forth
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.880]   from my mouth. It will not return to me empty without accomplishing what I desire and without
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.880]   succeeding in the matter for which I sent it." How marvelous is that to know,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:12.200]   that when you proclaim the Word of God, it is predetermined what God will do with it. We know what
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:21.720]   the work of the Word is. As we just read, it brings about salvation. It brings about sanctification.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.680]   It brings about spiritual growth. It fills the heart with hope.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:41.160]   It pours truth into the mind and the life. It empowers for the living of that truth. In 1 Thessalonians 2:13,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.160]   Paul writes, "We constantly thank God that when you received the Word of God,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.400]   which you have heard from me, you accepted it not as the word of men,
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.760]   but for what it really is, the Word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe."
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:11.320]   Hebrews 4:12 says, "The Word of God is alive and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword."
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   As a church, we have come to believe that the Word of God is divine revelation. All Scripture is
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:32.520]   inspired by God. We have come to believe that that revelation was placed through the minds of the
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:39.800]   writers of Scripture so that men didn't write their own ideas, but holy men were moved by the
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.960]   Holy Spirit to write. And that's what we're going to do. We're going to be a part of the Holy Spirit
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.560]   who writes the Scripture. We have come to the conviction from studying the Scripture
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:56.120]   that the law of the Lord is perfect, it is without error; that as Proverbs 30 says,
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.960]   "Every word of God is pure." We have come to the conviction that it is authoritative, as it says in
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:11.880]   Isaiah 1 and verse 2, "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord has spoken when God
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:22.920]   speaks, we listen." We have found the Word of God to be sufficient. It covers everything that we
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:33.240]   could possibly need. I could never close this day without reading that revelation from Psalm 19.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.880]   Verse 7: "The law of the Lord is perfect,
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.640]   converting the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.920]   The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure,
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.520]   enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   The judgments of the Lord are true; they are righteous altogether."
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:02.600]   That is the sufficiency of Scripture. We have come to believe that the Bible is clear,
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:11.720]   that as Psalm 119 says, "It is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:18.680]   path." And we have come to find that the Bible is also ultimately satisfying.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:26.520]   We find in it what John says, "These things are written so that our joy may be made complete."
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:33.240]   We find our joy in the Word of God. The Word of God is strong and powerful and
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:41.640]   penetrating and convicting. There's rebuke and there's restoration. There's conviction.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:49.880]   There's conviction and there's comfort. But there's joy in all of it. We find our joy in the
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:58.520]   Word of God. I could break down how we feel about the Word of God into four simple terms:
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:11.560]   recognition - we know what it means; conviction - we believe what it says; submission -
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:23.480]   we eagerly obey it; and the final one, affection - we love it. We love the Word of God.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:29.000]   Psalm 1 says, "How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.480]   but his delight is in the law of the Lord." That would define us. Our delight
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.760]   is in the law of the Lord. We're not here to be entertained.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.600]   We're not here to be an audience to some kind of show going on up here.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:56.120]   We're here to be fed the Word of God, because that's what we delight in.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.640]   Jesus was speaking to His disciples in John 6, and He said after the crowd had left Him,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.720]   "Will you also go away?" to which Peter, responding for the whole group, said,
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.400]   "To whom shall we go? You and you alone have the words of eternal life."
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:19.320]   There's nowhere else to go. There's no one else with the words of eternal life.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:26.120]   We love the Bible. Now, why is that the case? Is it because somehow we're smarter than
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:34.200]   other people who go to church? Is it because somehow we are more spiritual?
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:41.320]   Why is it that we have this love? Let me begin by having you look at
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.680]   the first chapter of 1 Thessalonians. Here's a start to answer that question:
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:55.320]   why do we love the Word the way we do? Why does it do its work in us the way it does?
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   Paul, writing to the Thessalonians in chapter 1 - we'll pick it up at verse 2 - says,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.120]   "We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.240]   constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfast
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.440]   fastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father,
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   knowing, brethren, beloved by God, His choice of you."
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:33.640]   How did we become the people we are? How did this happen? How did we become a people
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:40.760]   who does the work of faith and the labor of love and the steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.160]   Christ? Paul, writing to the Thessalonians in chapter 1, says, "We give thanks to God always for
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.800]   all of you, making mention of you in our prayers, constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.320]   labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   Father, because we were chosen. We were chosen." Verse 5: "The gospel didn't come to us in word
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:12:00.520]   only. It came in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction." Why? Because we were chosen.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.960]   Verse 6: "You became imitators of us and of the Lord,
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.120]   having received the Word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit." How did that happen?
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.080]   "We were chosen." Verse 6: "You became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the Word in
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.480]   much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit." Why? Because we were chosen.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:18.040]   "You became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia." And in verse 8 it says,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.240]   "And beyond that, in every place." How did that happen? Because we were chosen.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.080]   Verse 9: "You turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God." How did that happen?
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.640]   You were chosen. Paul gives us some insight into that in 1 Corinthians,
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:40.520]   chapter 1, so let's look at that for just a brief few moments. In this
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.960]   very rich portion of Scripture, starting in chapter 1, verse 18, running down through chapter 2,
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:55.240]   we have a contrast between those who do not hunger for the Scripture, who do not believe the Bible,
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:02.520]   and those who do. And just lightly touching on what this great text says,
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:10.920]   here is why non-Christians, non-believers do not accept the Bible.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:18.200]   Verse 18 says, "The word of the cross, the divine message, the center of which is the cross and
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:26.600]   Christ, is foolishness to them." The message is unreasonable. The Greek term is moron.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:34.280]   It is moronic. It is stupid. It does not suit human reason, this idea of a
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:40.840]   crucified Jew, crucified by the Romans, being God, the eternal God, the Creator, the
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.960]   universe, then rising from the dead, being the only Savior in the world, the only true God,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:51.960]   the only true Redeemer. Therefore, Christianity is the only true religion. All others are lies
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:14:03.000]   out of hell. To the unregenerate mind, that is unreasonable. People don't believe, secondly,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.480]   because the truth is not only unreasonable, it's unattainable. Look at verse 19: "For it is written,
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.760]   'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the wisdom of the wise, and the wisdom of the wise,
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.400]   and the cleverness of the clever I will set aside.'" In other words, you can't get to this
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.600]   truth by being wise and clever. "Where is the wise man?" verse 20. "Where is the scribe? Where is the
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:26.200]   debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For since in the wisdom of
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   God the world through its wisdom did not come to know Him." God was well pleased through the
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.760]   foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe. People on their own in the world
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:51.240]   are not willing to this knowledge. The Word of God is unreasonable, it is unattainable. Jeremiah said,
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:57.000]   "The wise men, behold, they have rejected the Word of the Lord, so what wisdom do they have?"
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:10.040]   Thirdly, even unattractive. The message isn't what people are looking for. Verse 22: "The Jews asked
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.600]   for a sign, and the Jews were not satisfied. They were not satisfied with the message, and they
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.960]   were not satisfied with the sign. The Greeks searched for wisdom. We preach Christ crucified,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:20.040]   to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness." The message is unattractive.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:29.080]   They want something more philosophical, do the Gentiles. The Jews want a sign, a sign in the sky,
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:40.520]   if you will, because not even the sign of the resurrection convinced them. We offer no signs. And
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:47.960]   this is not some kind of complex, erudite, esoteric philosophy that might tantalize
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:55.880]   the intellectuals. There's a historian who has written seven volumes on preaching,
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.120]   and he has a section on me, seven volumes on the history of preaching. And
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:09.880]   I want you to hear what he wrote about me. This is a quote: "MacArthur's rhetoric is terribly out of
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.440]   date. MacArthur's rhetoric is terribly out of date. MacArthur's rhetoric is terribly out of date.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:19.080]   But maybe he knows something the rest of us don't. Why do so many people listen to MacArthur,
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:26.680]   this product of all the wrong schools? How can he pack out a church on Sunday morning
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.280]   in an age in which church attendance has seriously lagged?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:37.480]   Here is a preacher who has nothing in the way of a winning personality, good looks, or charm.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:48.040]   Here is a preacher who has nothing in the way of a winning personality, good looks, or charm.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.760]   Thanks a lot.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:57.960]   Here is a preacher who offers us nothing in the way of sophisticated homiletical packaging.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:09.480]   No one would suggest that he is a master of the art of oratory. What he seems to have is a witness
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.280]   to true authority. He is a witness to true authority. He is a witness to true authority.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.720]   He is a witness to true authority. He is a witness to true authority. He recognizes in Scripture the
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.960]   Word of God. And when he preaches, it is the Scripture that one hears.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.760]   It is not that the words of John MacArthur are so interesting,
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:32.440]   as it is that the Word of God is of surpassing interest. That is why we listen."
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.240]   I think he got it. Could have been a little kinder in the process.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:52.200]   So you understand, while there are lots of people who are happy to listen to my teaching,
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:58.920]   the perspective of the world is, "There's nothing in me at all to cause that to happen."
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:09.320]   For all of these reasons, people don't believe the Bible. So why do we believe?
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.000]   Why do we believe? Here it comes, chapter 2, verse 6:
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.520]   "Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature." Here's the first reason:
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:27.960]   because we're mature. What does that word mean? teleios, complete.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:39.720]   Why do we believe? Because we're complete, we're fully developed. We're developed by God into unique,
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:47.480]   complete persons. You know, Paul's great ministry passion in Colossians
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:53.400]   at the end of chapter 1, he says this: "We proclaim Him," meaning Christ,
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.360]   "admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:06.520]   man complete in Christ." So we are in Christ, we are complete. That's the first reason we love
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.960]   Scripture. Paul's great ministry passion in Colossians at the end of chapter 1, he says this:
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:17.800]   "We proclaim Him." "In Him," says Colossians 2, "we are complete, and in Him are hidden all the
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.440]   treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and we are complete in Him."
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:32.520]   Secondly, we believe the Bible because, verse 7, we are predestined to believe it.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:39.240]   We speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.880]   our glory. We speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God predestined before the ages to our glory.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:45.640]   Did you see that? Do you know why you believe the Bible? Because God, before time began,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:20:01.160]   predestined you to believe it. Go back to verse 27 in chapter 1: "God has chosen, God has chosen."
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:09.800]   Verse 8: "God has chosen." Verse 30: "By His
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:17.080]   doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness,
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:23.400]   and sanctification, and redemption." It's His doing, His choosing, His predestining, His calling.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:34.200]   And He chose specific kinds of people. He chose the foolish, the weak, the base, the despised,
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:39.720]   the nobodies, so that no one may boast before God. We don't
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.000]   believe because we're smarter than other people. We believe because we've been
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.640]   made complete in Christ, because we are the predestined, and we are predestined to eternal
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:21:00.120]   glory. Predestination before time began, had in mind eternal glory after time was ended.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:08.360]   Thirdly, verses 8 and 9: "Because we
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:24.060]   are the
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.760]   chosen, we are the chosen." Verse 8: "The wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.080]   If they understood it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory. They did that because they
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.800]   hated Him. But it is written, 'Things which eye has not seen, ear has not heard.' They're not visible
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:39.560]   by any empirical methodology. Divine truth can't be known empirically, and which have not entered the
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:47.960]   world. It can't be known instinctively, intuitively, internally. It's not available. But God has given
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:57.640]   it for those - " end of verse 9 " - who love Him." We have been made complete in Christ. We have
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:06.120]   been predestined to eternal glory. We love Him. We love Him because He first loved us.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.480]   We love Him because He first loved us.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.160]   That's why we believe.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.240]   Fourthly, because we've received the Holy Spirit. Verse 10: "God has revealed them through the
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.840]   Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. For who among men knows the
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.400]   thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.040]   knows no one except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the Spirit of the world, but the
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   Spirit is from God, that we may know the things freely given to us by God."
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.400]   That's why we understand the Scripture. He's the truth teacher, the author of Scripture,
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   lives in us, and is the interpreter of what he inspired.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:52.440]   Fifthly, Paul says, "Because we are therefore spiritual." Look at verses 14 and 15: "A natural
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.800]   man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness to him. He cannot
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:03.000]   understand them because they are spiritually discerned. But he who is spiritual appraises or
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.120]   discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no one." The world doesn't understand us. They
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.320]   can't figure us out. They can't figure us out. They can't figure us out. We're just a bunch of
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:16.680]   fools. They can't discern who we are. But we, because we are spiritual, pneumatikos,
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:22.360]   because we are endowed with spiritual life, are no longer in the natural fallen condition.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.080]   We have been made new creations. We've been born again, regenerate.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:34.680]   We now possess spiritual life, the life of God. And we anachrono, we judge everything
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.240]   by the Word of God and by the understanding of the Word of God that is vouchsafed to us.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.520]   And we are not just a bunch of fools. We are a bunch of fools. We are a bunch of fools. We are
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.560]   not just a bunch of fools. We are a bunch of fools. We are a bunch of fools. We are a bunch of fools.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:47.640]   And one other thing, this is so amazing, verse 16: "We have the mind of Christ,
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:54.840]   who has known the mind of the Lord, that He will instruct him," from Isaiah 40. The answer:
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:01.960]   "We have the mind of Christ." What an amazing statement. Why do we love the Scripture?
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.840]   Because we think the way Christ thinks. Why? Because we have His mind. What does that mean?
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.160]   As a believer, you don't have the body of Christ,
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.280]   but you have the mind of Christ. The only part of Christ that's in you is the mind of Christ.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:26.360]   Borrowed from Jeremiah, "Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord." Psalm 34:2 says,
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:38.360]   "My soul makes its boast in the Lord. Let the humble hear and be glad."
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:46.620]   Jeremiah 9:23 and 24 says, "Let not a wise man boast in his wisdom; let not the mighty
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.800]   man boast of his might; let not a rich man boast of his riches; but let him who boasts
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:58.320]   boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the Lord, who exercises loving
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.060]   kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things."
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:11.080]   So here we are, and all worship goes to God, all glory goes to God, all boasting goes to
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   Him.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.820]   If you feel like you're a spectator on the outside looking through a window, you say,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.540]   "I don't have this kind of passion, I don't have this kind of love for the Word.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.280]   I don't see that in my heart."
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:33.880]   You need to pray this prayer, Psalm 119:18: "Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:33.880]   out there."
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:41.900]   Open your heart to the Word of God and ask Him to bless you and your family and your friends.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.900]   You can't just pray to the Lord and say, "I'm going to bless you."
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.920]   You need to pray to the Lord and ask Him to bless you.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.040]   You need to be able to say, "I'm going to bless you."
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.320]   You need to be able to say, "I'm going to bless you."
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.100]   You need to be able to say, "I'm going to bless you."
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.180]   You need to be able to say, "I'm going to bless you."
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.700]   You need to be able to say, "I'm going to bless you."
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:09.380]   the Word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, all of those things.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:18.040]   We teach the Word all the time. The Word is our source for all teaching. That gets lost
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.820]   on some people today, but it's never been lost on me. That's why we've been unleashing
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:27.640]   God's truth one verse at a time for half a century. So you've got to get the theology
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.460]   right, the doctrine right, the interpretation of scripture right. If you don't, you should
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:38.020]   be ashamed. That's why Paul says, "Be a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed because you're
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.740]   rightly dividing the Word of truth." So that's absolutely critical. But alongside of that,
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.320]   Paul said, "Take heed to yourself." In fact, he put that first.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.540]   Your life has to back that up. When you look at 1 Timothy and you see the requirements
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:58.360]   for an elder or a pastor, it doesn't say anything about content. It just says things about character.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.220]   And when you go to Titus and you look what Titus says about the elder or the pastor,
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:08.340]   it's exactly the same thing. It's just a list of character qualities. We have to live a
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:14.300]   life that undergirds what we say. I remember reading when I was very young that when you
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:21.460]   teach the Word of God, it's like sort of setting nails in a piece of wood. You set the nails
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:28.860]   by your teaching. But this writer said, "By your life, you drive those nails deep." I
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.260]   also knew there was another element that was critical. I knew that the Word of God was
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:29.380]   a very powerful tool. I knew that the Word of God was a very powerful tool. I knew that
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:29.680]   the Word of God was a very powerful tool. I knew that the Word of God was a very powerful
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:29.860]   tool. I knew that the Word of God was a very powerful tool. I knew that the Word of God was
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.180]   a very powerful tool. I knew that the Word of God was a very powerful tool. I knew that the Word of God
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:37.620]   that was critically essential in a life of a man of God in ministry and that was to produce others
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:43.140]   who would do the same thing. The apostle Paul also said to Timothy, the things you've heard from me
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:49.620]   among many witnesses, the same commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. So from
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.420]   the very beginning I knew it was Paul to Timothy, to faithful men, to others also. That's four
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:28:00.340]   generations, that's like a relay race. So my responsibility was to take heed to myself in terms
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:06.500]   of godly living, to my theology in terms of accurate preaching, and then to pour my life
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:13.060]   into other men who would do the very same thing. And that is exactly how my life has gone
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.860]   through all the years of ministry. I'm so thankful for clarity in the early years
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:22.020]   of my ministry to understand those things and now to enjoy the fruit of them.
