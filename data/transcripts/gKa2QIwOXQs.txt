[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   We address pushbacks and concerns on the podcast like this one.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.000]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm a joyful graduate of Bethlehem College and Seminary.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   I was also able to fly back this year to attend the Pastors Conference.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.280]   I've been blessed by God's work in your ministry for years and find myself consistently in
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.960]   agreement with you.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.480]   However, one area of difference that struck me at the 2017 Pastors Conference was the
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.960]   statement you made that Jesus' reign isn't good news, which was recently reposted online.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.440]   Here's my struggle.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.440]   The statement "the kingdom of God is not good news" seems to conflict what I see in Isaiah
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.160]   52 7, especially in light of Hebrews 2 verses 5-9.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.340]   I am in full agreement that the atonement is necessary, but rather than seeing this
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.060]   as odds to Jesus' reign, I see it, atonement, as a vehicle of his reign, that is, his reign
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.760]   demands that all of his enemies are under his feet.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.920]   This includes sin and death according to 1 Corinthians 15 verses 55-56.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.240]   And the means of their defeat was his suffering, as we see in Hebrews 2 verse 9.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.640]   Am I wrong in seeing Jesus' reign in this way?
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.520]   I hope this makes sense and comes across with the great respect that I have for you and
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.960]   the earnest desire for your response.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.800]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.320]   Well, I doubt that we have a basic disagreement, but let me say what I was thinking and see
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.080]   if this helps.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:41.460]   When I say, and I don't say it often because it's so blatantly wrong at one level and right
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:50.220]   at another, when I say, "The kingdom of God is not good news," I know that I'm saying
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.820]   something which, out of context, contradicts numerous texts of the Bible.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.340]   Luke 4:43, Jesus says, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God."
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.860]   Good grief, it's so clear.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.240]   Yes, it's good news.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.480]   The kingdom of God is good news.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.100]   Jesus came preaching the good news of the kingdom, and of course, it is based on Isaiah
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.100]   52.7.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.340]   How beautiful, how beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news.
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.340]   What good news?
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.340]   "Who say to Zion, 'Your God reigns!'"
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:36.300]   So to those who have Him as their God, that's really good news.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.180]   I fight for you.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.100]   So why do I say something so blatantly opposite to what the Bible says in its own language?
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.060]   And I say it because it's true in the way I mean it and the way I explain it, and it's
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.820]   true biblically.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.400]   When the kingdom of God is established, finally, with the new heaven and the new earth, those
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:13.480]   who have not repented and received the forgiveness of sins offered through the gospel of Christ's
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.360]   shed blood and perfected righteousness will perish.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.720]   They will perish precisely because God reigns.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.760]   They will perish precisely because the kingdom came decisively and finally and gloriously.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.320]   Here's a description of what's going to happen.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.400]   Second Thessalonians 1.7.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.100]   Here's what happens when the king comes.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.740]   The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.200]   vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Lord Jesus.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.520]   They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction away from the presence of the
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.440]   Lord and the glory of His might.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.000]   And Revelation 6.16 describes what will happen when the throne is exalted and people see
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   it.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.020]   They will call on the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us, hide us from the face of Him
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.440]   who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb."
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.680]   That's not good news to them.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.400]   That's the worst news they could possibly hear is that God reigns over their unrepentant
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.760]   rebellion.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.800]   So what moves me to use this drastic language, "The kingdom of God is not good news,"
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:49.480]   is that some preachers today, some younger preachers, older preachers, are downplaying
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.320]   the centrality and prominence of the personal work of salvation through the cross in the
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.320]   forgiveness of sins and the propitiating of the wrath of God.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.600]   And they are instead foregrounding cosmic, global triumph of God over the world and the
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.440]   restoration of all things to the way it should be.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.480]   And it is possible to wax very global and social and environmental and holistic and
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.280]   comprehensive and eloquent as if the preachers of the traditional historic personal gospel
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.000]   that Christ died for the sins of individuals somehow didn't know that Romans 8.18-25 is
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.680]   in the Bible where the whole creation waits for the revealing of the sons of God who have
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.800]   been individually redeemed.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.760]   I've always taught the renovation of the universe is a playground for the children
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.680]   of God who've been saved.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:57.960]   And what I'm concerned about is that the magnificent propitiating work of the blood of Jesus to
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.720]   remove the wrath of God from his people by his blood is minimized.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.380]   It's treated as an afterthought, a footnote.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.840]   You have to raise your hand and say, "What about that?"
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.480]   And then they say it.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.000]   But there are those who even despise it.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.400]   When I said, "Farewell, Rob Bell," I wasn't reacting to his view of hell.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:33.480]   I was reacting to his despising the atonement in his video where he made fun of the work
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.720]   of God to propitiate God through the sacrifice of his son.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.920]   But that's not the impression you get when you read the New Testament.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.320]   You don't get the impression that the personal saving, forgiving, justifying, reconciling
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   work of Jesus for particular people who are guilty before God is backgrounded.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.020]   You don't.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.840]   You do not get that impression.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.620]   You read the New Testament, and of course there's a global, cosmic, glorious consummation
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.440]   to all things, but nobody's going there with a guilty conscience.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.120]   We must be forgiven for our sins.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.500]   We must have the righteousness of Jesus.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.440]   We must have our guilt removed.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.760]   So my way of responding to that emphasis is to say, "If you're going to talk about the
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:34.660]   kingdom as the essence of the gospel, you better be clear that millions and millions
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.000]   of people will experience the final coming of the kingdom as the worst thing that could
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.260]   ever happen to them."
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:48.500]   The best news in all the world is how the king has chosen to reign.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.060]   He has chosen to come in two stages.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:58.860]   The first time as a servant to give his life as a ransom for many, Mark 10.45.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.180]   The glory of the king is going to be upheld.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.100]   Oh, yes, it will.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:13.060]   And wonder of wonders, traitors, penitent, believing rebels are going to be pardoned,
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:21.580]   even adopted into the king's family because the king became a curse for us.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:27.500]   Galatians 3.13, "In his flesh, our sin is condemned."
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:35.100]   Romans 8.3, "He bore in his body what we should have borne."
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.920]   Isaiah 53, 1 Peter 2.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.620]   This is the heart of the gospel.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:46.220]   And without it, the reign of God is only bad news.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:53.500]   And with it, with this cross, the reign of God is our joy and our glory.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   Amen.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.660]   Thank you for that clarification, Pastor John.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.500]   We really do welcome and invite critical pushback of things we have published or said in the
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.740]   past.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.200]   We don't hide from pushback and we know we're not infallible.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.140]   So we welcome your criticisms and your questions.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.700]   And you can email those to us through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.060]   Well, there's been a lot of talk lately about catechisms, especially with the release of
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.860]   TGC's new catechism, the New City Catechism.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.940]   But the question comes back, what's a better investment of my time, studying a catechism
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.540]   or memorizing scripture directly?
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.140]   What are the pros and what are the cons?
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.060]   We'll hear from Pastor John on that next time.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.540]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.100]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.000]   Amen.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   [END]
