[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   [silence]
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.360]   Exercise snacks.
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.080]   And as the name suggests, this is a fun one.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.200]   And was suggested by Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.840]   as a way to either enhance or maintain your fitness
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.320]   depending on how your core
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.800]   or foundational fitness program is going.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.620]   So when I say core, I don't mean your abs.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.120]   I mean, whether or not you're getting your regular cardio
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.000]   and your regular resistance training.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.520]   If you were to add one
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.160]   or several of these exercise snacks per week,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.600]   it can further improve things like VO2 max,
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.240]   muscular endurance, et cetera.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.120]   I'll talk about the specific snacks
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.320]   that you will be doing in a moment.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.920]   However, as Dr. Andy Galpin also pointed out,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.020]   there are times in which we happen to not be following
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.760]   our foundational fitness program,
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.880]   either because work demands or family demands
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.320]   or we're traveling.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.240]   We're simply not keeping up with our basic routine.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.320]   And under those conditions,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.340]   exercise snacks are a terrific way to maintain the fitness
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.440]   that you've already built and developed.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.120]   And you don't lose any ground in a week,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.320]   say, where you get particularly busy.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.340]   Now, exercise snacks can take on a variety
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.640]   of different forms,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.200]   but for sake of simplicity and clarity,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.020]   today we're going to divide them into two major categories.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.320]   The first category are exercise snacks
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.760]   that are going to improve
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.440]   or maintain your cardiovascular fitness,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.120]   so your ability to run or cycle or row
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.880]   some distance, say, 12 minutes or longer, okay?
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.720]   But keep in mind,
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.480]   these exercise snacks are very, very brief.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.760]   They don't require that you do them
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.360]   for 12 minutes or longer.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.160]   What they're going to do is either maintain
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.760]   or enhance the type of endurance
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.560]   that allows you to continue in an activity
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.000]   for 12 minutes or longer.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.140]   The second category of exercise snack
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.240]   relates to muscular endurance.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.280]   Muscular endurance is a very important aspect of fitness.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.020]   And even though some people are already training
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.360]   for muscular endurance,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.700]   it's something that most people
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.080]   are not doing enough training for.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.320]   Muscular endurance is your ability, say,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.240]   to maintain a wall sit or to maintain a plank
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.160]   or to do the maximum number of push-ups
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.960]   that you can do in one session,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.240]   the sort of, you know, drop to the floor
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.080]   and give me as many push-ups as you possibly can
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.040]   type of thing, or as many sit-ups as you can type of thing.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.240]   Muscular endurance translates
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   to a number of other aspects of fitness,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.580]   and it's something that we should all be working on.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.960]   And again, many people just don't make space for it
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.480]   in their regular routine.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.440]   So now we have these two categories of exercise snacks,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.280]   one geared toward enhancing
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   or maintaining your cardiovascular fitness
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   as it translates to longer duration endurance activity,
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.680]   so 12 minutes or longer.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.620]   And then the other category is purely muscular endurance,
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.620]   which is essentially some bout of exercise
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.000]   that's going to be fairly brief,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.540]   anywhere from a minute to two minutes,
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.120]   but certainly less than 12 minutes.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.880]   Okay, so let me give you an example of an exercise snack
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.640]   for enhancing your long duration endurance,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.560]   12 minutes or longer.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.020]   And this is the sort of thing
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.440]   that if you're going to incorporate into your routine,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.240]   and I highly recommend that you do,
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.880]   can essentially be done anytime with no warmup.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.400]   A good example of an exercise snack of this type
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.420]   would be to suddenly stand up from your desk
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.640]   and to do a hundred jumping jacks.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.520]   Now, depending on how fit you are
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.040]   and how fast you do those jumping jacks
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.080]   and how wide and tall you do those jumping jacks,
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.740]   meaning are you doing these kind of little things
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.360]   where your hands don't actually meet
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.260]   and you're parting your legs just a little bit,
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.680]   or are you doing full jumping jacks
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.980]   where you're really jumping and setting your feet out
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.080]   as wide as you comfortably and safely can
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.400]   and then bring your hands together,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.120]   it could take you anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.400]   Okay, so in the case of jumping jacks,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.440]   you may end up doing this for 90 seconds,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.280]   but the point is to simply do a hundred jumping jacks.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.800]   Or if that takes too long,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.100]   you can even do just 25 or 50 jumping jacks.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.280]   The point is that it's going to get you
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.880]   moving your muscles.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.080]   It's going to get your heart rate up.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.440]   Even if you're very, very fit,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.740]   if you're doing these fast enough
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.640]   and you're doing them with proper form,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.580]   it's going to get your heart rate up and then you're done.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.980]   You can sit back down to your desk
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.420]   or you can continue to walk through the airport.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.420]   Yes, I've done these in the airport,
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.540]   typically not while walking toward my gate,
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.540]   but at the gate.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.100]   But occasionally I'm feeling lethargic
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.740]   or I haven't had the opportunity to train that day.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.540]   And perhaps I won't get the opportunity to train.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.560]   So I'll do something like a hundred jumping jacks
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.380]   while facing the window.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.300]   So it feels a little less awkward
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.060]   facing people while you're doing them.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.720]   And of course you don't have to do jumping jacks.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.520]   An equally effective type of exercise snack
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.140]   is to find a stairwell and to simply go up that stairwell
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.620]   as fast as you safely can for 20 to 30 seconds.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.860]   So perhaps just find the bottom of a stairwell
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.980]   and go up that stairwell as quickly as you can.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.460]   And perhaps go down as quickly as you can.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.820]   And just keep doing that for about 20 to 40 seconds.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.980]   And then you're essentially done.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.180]   You could also opt to pick some distance
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.060]   away from your car in the parking lot,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.160]   assuming you're not carrying any heavy bags or anything,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.980]   and simply run to your car.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.460]   So 20 to 30 seconds of not necessarily all out sprinting.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.020]   You don't want to injure yourself because again,
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.500]   this is done without a warmup.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.540]   These exercise snacks are designed to be inserted
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.020]   into your day and into your week, essentially at random.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.620]   You could plan them if you want,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.040]   but anytime you feel inspired
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.500]   or perhaps anytime you're feeling
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.820]   like you don't want to do one,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.460]   you could simply do one of these exercise snacks.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.480]   And of course doing jumping jacks or running to your car
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.140]   or taking the stairs very quickly up and down
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.540]   or just up and then walking down, for instance,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.380]   and doing a few jumping jacks, things of that sort,
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.800]   of course can take on a near infinite number
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.740]   of different variations.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.800]   So if you don't like any of the variations
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.980]   that I just presented,
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.620]   you can easily come up with something else.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.100]   Again, the purpose of these exercise snacks
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.820]   is to get your heart rate up.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.780]   It's of course to do this while not getting injured.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.860]   And it is entirely compatible
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.180]   with an existing exercise program.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.340]   It in no way is going to impede your performance
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.740]   in strength or hypertrophy
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.540]   or other forms of long-form endurance
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.520]   or high-intensity interval training, quite to the contrary.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.220]   Everything we know about these exercise snacks
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.160]   is that they enhance various aspects of your physiology
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.060]   in ways that promote both recovery and performance
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.020]   in your other types of exercise
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.860]   and your other types of athletic endeavors.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.020]   So no reason to think that they are going to be problematic
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.260]   for your training, but of course, don't trip, don't fall,
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.780]   don't undertake a movement
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.120]   that puts you into a range of motion
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.700]   that has you hurting your back or your knee
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.100]   or any other part of your body.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.580]   You know, start off slowly
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.260]   and find something that really works for you.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.700]   So these are very easy.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.020]   They take very little time.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.660]   They're fun, to be honest.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.300]   And as was discussed in the conversation
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.260]   with Dr. Andy Galpin, they're also very effective.
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.840]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.240]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.300]   you
