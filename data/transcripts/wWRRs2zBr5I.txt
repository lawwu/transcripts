[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.840]   Hi, everyone. I'm Jesse, founder and CEO of Morph Labs. I'll be telling you today about
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.820]   how we're enabling the rise of the AI software engineer. Programming is evolving. Programming
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960]   was once called automatic programming. Logarithms used to be considered human
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.880]   knowledge work. One day, we'll think about how engineering was once called AI
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   engineering, and how intelligence used to be called artificial general
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.500]   intelligence. And along the way, we will command legions of AI software engineers
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:55.940]   to write the code for us. Here at Morph Labs, our mission is to bring the personal
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.680]   AI software engineer to everyone. The personal AI software engineer will
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.740]   understand you, the best practices for your software, your favorite idioms. The
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.160]   personal AI software engineer will understand your code base better than you
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.800]   do. Its capabilities will evolve with you and your code, and it will always stay up
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.540]   to date. The personal AI software engineer will augment you at every stage of the
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.280]   software development lifecycle, from ideation and specification to implementation testing
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:34.040]   and deployment. I'm proud to announce the Morph Code Index, a major milestone towards the
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.780]   personal AI software engineer. The Morph Code Index is a neuro-symbolic code database for you
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.060]   and your coding assistant. With it, you can run semantic searches with natural language over
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.280]   your code base, make your entire code base and Git history visible to your coding assistant, and transmute
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.220]   your code base into training data for your personal AI software engineer. So let's dive into what it does.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:11.020]   The Morph Code Index helps you find relevant code faster. We use static analysis, vector embeddings, and graph algorithms to create a state of the art code search index.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.960]   The Morph Code Index also ships with a neuro-symbolic query language, which can be used to guarantee precise results.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:28.960]   The code index is the only AI-native code search engine. It will make your coding assistant smarter. With our Python bindings, it will be easy to attach a Morph Code Index to any coding assistant to give it code base-wide context via retrieval.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.900]   Finally, the Morph Code Index can traverse your code base to generate vast quantities of training data. We've already used this exact pipeline to train our
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.840]   newly released Riff Coder 7b model, which is the only open source model for code editing that can run on your laptop and in your IDE.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:50.780]   All you have to do is index your code, run the generation script, and you can start training your personal AI software engineer.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:03:00.720]   Here at Morph Labs, we believe the future of software should belong to everyone.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   That's why the Morph Code Index is open source, transparent, and free. Your code. Your data. Your model.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:20.660]   Finally, just for AI engineer attendees, we will soon be announcing a platform for building, managing, and deploying your personal AI software engineer.

[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.540]   And thank you for your attention.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.320]   Thank you.
