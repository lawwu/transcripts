[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   If the goal is to challenge muscles and one is dividing their body into, let's say, you
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.460]   know, three or four day a week split or so, or maybe up to six.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.200]   How do you know when a muscle is ready to be challenged again?
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.780]   I've heard, okay, every 48 hours is, you know, protein synthesis increases and then we'll
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.000]   get into this and then it drops off.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.040]   But frankly, if I train my legs hard, I can get stronger from workout to workout, or at
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.880]   least better in some way, workout to workout, leg workout to leg workout, training them
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.740]   once every five to eight days.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.240]   If I train them more often, I get worse.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.680]   So whatever that 48 hour to 72 hour thing is, somehow my legs don't obey that, but,
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.060]   you know, or maybe something else is wrong with me, but I'm sure there are many things
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.680]   else wrong with me, but how do you assess recovery at the local level, meaning at the
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.680]   level of the muscles?
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.320]   So we'll talk about soreness and getting better, stronger, more repetitions, et cetera.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.180]   And then the systemic level, the level of the nervous system.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.220]   And I'd love for you to tell us about the tool that, again, I learned from you, which
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.180]   is actually using a physical scale, because it turns out this is that it will let you
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.360]   tell what the tool is, but that tool is also actively being used for assessing cognitive
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.500]   decline and cognitive maintenance and cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's and dementia.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.120]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Makes total sense, makes total sense.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.340]   I, alright, so regarding the first part of the question, like, you know, how do you,
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.860]   how would you kind of dictate when a muscle's recovered?
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.140]   So I do think that what you're experiencing is totally real, that different muscles recover
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.580]   at different rates.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.640]   And I've always been so fascinated by this concept, I've talked about internally with
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.200]   my team, but like, I feel like what we really need, the holy grail to training is going
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.120]   to be when we're able to crack the code on an individual basis when a muscle is recovered,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.920]   and that is going to dictate its training schedule.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.840]   And the fact that you might have a bicep that could be trained, you know, via a pulling
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.960]   workout, a regular bicep dedicated workout, forget the split at the moment.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.740]   You might have a bicep that's able to be trained that can be trained again the next day, you
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.300]   know, and then the next day, and then maybe you need a day off after that, but like, you
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.020]   know, and that can vary from person to person for sure, and it can vary from muscle to muscle
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.660]   in that person over the course of time, as you mentioned, because the systemic recovery
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.660]   is going to impact all those muscles anyway, but let's say you're systemically recovering,
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.080]   every muscle itself is going to have a, you know, a recovery rate, and I think what's
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.620]   fascinating is that when you talked about before we like to train in this week or we
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.940]   have like the way our mind looks at training, well, if that was the case with the biceps,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.540]   that bicep is a slave to the rest of your training split, you know, where it's like,
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.540]   why does it have to be also at the end of every eighth day or, you know, or whatever
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.220]   when it might respond better to something much more frequently, and your legs are also
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.060]   being thrown into that mix.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.760]   There's a Mike Mencer concept where he's like, you know, training, you know, one set
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.200]   and be done for 14 days.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.240]   I mean, you know, there's such variability between muscle groups, and you're linking
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.280]   them all together.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.040]   I think that coming back and using muscle soreness as a guideline for that is one of
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.720]   the only tools we have in terms of the local level, you know.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.040]   We don't really have, you know, being able to measure, let's say, CPK levels inside
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.920]   of a muscle would be amazing, you know, at a local level to see how recovered that muscle
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.280]   is, but that becomes fairly invasive, at least to my knowledge, it becomes fairly invasive.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.120]   So what are our tools?
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.480]   I mean, I think that at the basic level, that's the one that most people can relate to and
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.240]   easily identify and then use that as a guideline, and if you're training when you're really
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.000]   sore, it's probably not a great idea, and it's probably a good indication that that
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.680]   muscle is not recovered, but at least hearing what you and I are saying here might be a
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.360]   comfort to the person to say, "Yeah, it is possible that it's not recovered, just
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.680]   because 48 hours is the recommendation, and just because research points to muscle protein
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.360]   synthesis needing a restimulation, well, maybe not.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.680]   Maybe you're not necessarily there yet, and for that muscle, you're not there yet."
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.240]   So it's all really interesting stuff, but as far as the systemic, you know, recovery,
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.360]   I think there's a lot of ways, you know, people talk about resting heart rate measured
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.240]   in the morning, all different kinds of, you know, core temperature and things like that
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.340]   that might become altered in a state of non-recovery, but grip strength is very, very much tied
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.560]   to performance and recovery, and when I was at the Mets, we used to actually take grip
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   strength measurements as a baseline in spring training all the time.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.440]   Now, obviously, as a baseball player, you're gripping a bat, you're a pitcher, you're gripping
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   a ball.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.800]   You know, having good grip strength is important, so if we've noticed somebody had a very weak
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.760]   grip, it's just a good focal point of a specialized training component for the program.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.000]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Would you do this every day with those guys?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Dr. Tim Jackson No.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.520]   We would doâ€”in spring training, we'd do sort of a baseline entry-level measurement,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.080]   and then we would measure it throughout the season, maybe once every two weeks or three
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.760]   weeks, and, you know, the idea there was to, you know, manage the recovery, measure the
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   recovery.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.280]   But I just gave it away, you know, to determine overall recovery, your grip strength is pretty
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.400]   highly correlated, so we have found that with one of those scales, those old-fashioned bathroom
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.920]   scales at like Bed Bath & Beyond or wherever you can get, which, by the way, almost impossible.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.640]   I believe Jesse and I were searching for the last scale to put in that video, and we almost
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.960]   couldn't find one because everything is like digital, and everything, you know, it's like
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   this.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   I'm looking at the old-fashioned dial controls.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani It's like old Macintosh computers.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.120]   There's a huge market for them, and old phones.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.040]   Kids, keep your phones now.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.560]   In 30 years, the lame phone now will be worth a lot of money.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:05.160]   So, you know, I wound up, you know, finding one and it's a great tool for just squeezing
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.580]   the scale with your hands and seeing what type of output you could get.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.880]   I think we all can relate to this when you just visualize.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.120]   Imagine the last time you were sick or just try this, you know, the next time you wake
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.120]   up in the morning.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.040]   When you first wake up in the morning, you're still groggy, try to squeeze your hand.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.760]   Try to make a fist as hard as you can.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.840]   You're going to sit there angry at your fist because it won't contract as hard as you know
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.960]   it can.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.640]   You don't have the ability to just create the output, and that is because in that state,
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   you're still sleepy.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640]   You're still fatigued.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.320]   You know, you're not even awake at the whole level at this point.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:51.080]   Well, that is still an actual phenomenon that happens that, you know, a lack of recovery
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.240]   or lack of wakefulness or whatever you want to say is going to lead to a decreased output
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   there.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.400]   So, when you start to measure that on a daily basis, you can get a pretty good sense of
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   where you're at.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.840]   I think when people start to see a drop off of 10% or so or even greater of their grip
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.400]   output, you really should skip the gym that day because I don't think there's much you're
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.080]   going to do there that's going to be that beneficial, even if it is the day to train
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.320]   legs or whatever day it is.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   I love this tool.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   It's simple.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   It's low cost.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   You can't find such a scale.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.640]   I guess you could also find one of those grippers that, and you can do this in a very nonquantitative
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.160]   way, but better would be a scale where you could actually measure how hard you can squeeze
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.960]   this thing at a given time of day.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.320]   It draws to mind just a little neuroscience factoid.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.480]   In the world of circadian neurobiology, one of the consistent findings is that in the
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.000]   middle of your nighttime, you know, they'll wake people up and they'll say, "Do this test."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.920]   In the laboratory, they use a different apparatus, but it's essentially the same thing.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.040]   In the middle of the night, grip strength is very, very low.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.000]   Mid-morning, grip strength is high, and as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.200]   grip strength goes higher and higher and higher, and then it drops off.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.480]   There's a circadian rhythm in grip temperature, so you probably want to do this at more or
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.240]   less the same time each day if you're going to use it, but I think it's brilliant in its
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.040]   simplicity and its directness to these upper motor neurons because that's really what it's
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   assessing.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.880]   Your ability, again, it's about the ability to contract the muscles hard.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.040]   If you can't do that, you're not going to get an effective workout.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.600]   They also, I mean, there certainly are more sophisticated tools, too, as a PT.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.840]   We have hand-grip dynamometers, and we can measure one side at a time, too.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.960]   I'm getting a little bit blinded by the fact that both hands are squeezing into that scale,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.480]   and I don't get really a left-right comparison, but even at that level, that could give you
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.200]   a little bit more detail, but that comes with a cost.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.000]   Those are pretty expensive devices, but if it's, listen, if you were an athlete, you
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.680]   know, the 200, 300 bucks it costs to have one of those would be well worth, you know,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   the added investment.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.680]   You know?
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.600]   And I'm sure some of our listeners are going to want one, too, because there are a lot
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.240]   of tech geeks out there.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.760]   Not tech industry geeks, but people who like tech gear.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   What's it called again?
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   It's a hand-grip dynamometer.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   Hand-grip dynamometer.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   Dynamometer.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   Dynamometer.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.600]   Said by Jeff with a great East Coast accent and by me in a terrible botched West Coast
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.000]   version.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.360]   Thank you.
