[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   The idea that we're going to go through this phase shift
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.320]   with CapEx and revenues perfectly
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.680]   aligned and perfectly matched, it
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.000]   would be the first major phase shift we went through
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   where that's the case.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:25.640]   Hey, Bill, good to see you.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.800]   Great to see you.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800]   So much for a smooth, nice exit to the summer.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.360]   I mean, what a week.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.920]   Been a rough summer.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.760]   I mean, it reminds me of this video going around
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.560]   with Peter Lynch in it, you know?
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.720]   It's 1987.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.540]   He's managing the Magellan Fund.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.240]   I think it has like $12 billion in it.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.040]   He finally-- his wife convinces him
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.280]   to go away to play a couple of days of golf in Ireland, right?
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.480]   And it's hard to actually keep track of the market in '87.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.720]   He says in two days, his fund goes from $12 billion
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.320]   to $8 billion.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.360]   He's like, I took two days.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.000]   And he lost 30% of the value in his fund.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.680]   Oh, rough, rough.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.120]   I don't think it's been that bad.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.040]   But it's been bad.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.720]   It's been, you know, a lot of stocks
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.040]   have been reset pretty dramatically here.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.360]   And one thing that I thought would be great
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.720]   to talk about today is just to spend a lot of time
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.800]   on these public markets.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.040]   This is a world you live in every day.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   I did participate, I had a brief career
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.880]   as a Southside analyst arguably three decades ago.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.120]   So I consider myself more of a sideline player
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.040]   to the public markets.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.120]   But I do pay attention.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.560]   I've often said that the public markets are
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.880]   the buyers of private companies.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.920]   And you got to know them.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.640]   You got to know them.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.400]   You got to study them.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.980]   You got to know what they want to buy.
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.080]   So I do pay attention.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.160]   But let's focus it your way.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.320]   So just to run down some numbers, S&P down 8%,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.080]   which wiped out $4 trillion.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.520]   The QQQ down 11%.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.880]   There were three worst days since March of 2020.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.480]   Max Seven's down a trillion dollars.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.680]   Crypto, which you kind of would have thought maybe
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.200]   would have rallied with what's going on, didn't.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.520]   It traded down in sympathy.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.480]   And we've seen this a bit where you hope for it
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.440]   to be uncorrelated.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.200]   And then, oh shit, it's correlated.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.320]   And then everyone's talking about Buffett jumping out
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.440]   of his Apple position.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.680]   So you did speak about taking risk off
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.960]   at the beginning of the summer.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.360]   And it looks like that was a smart move.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   Congratulations.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.720]   But tell us what you think you're seeing out there
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.480]   and how people should put all this in perspective.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.320]   I think that's the key.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.040]   This is not 1987.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.840]   In fact, we've seen this big bounce back
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.400]   the last couple of days.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.000]   And while we've been having these big gyrations,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.280]   if you just put it in context, since Q1 of 2023--
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920]   remember, when everybody was really
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.520]   nervous at the start of '23 about Mike Wilson's
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.360]   hard landing.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.560]   So that's just six quarters ago, right
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.200]   after chat GPT hit the screens.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.120]   Stocks are up 60%.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.640]   I mean, that's a huge move in six quarters.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.040]   And the Qs were up nearly 80% at their peak in July.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.320]   Many individual stocks have more than doubled, like Nvidia.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.000]   So I put what's happened this week
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.640]   and what's happened over the course of the last month
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.320]   in kind of run-of-the-mill, healthy consolidation
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.640]   of these big gains that we had in these six quarters.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.080]   But what I said at the beginning of summer,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.760]   we're active managers, right?
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.640]   So I live with one foot in the venture markets,
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.440]   where we think about five or 10-year time horizons.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.040]   But in the public markets, we have
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.840]   to think about risk-reward every day.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.560]   And as stocks have run up, it has
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.360]   been accompanied by what we think
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.520]   is a deterioration in some of the conditions, right?
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.560]   So this means the skew has gone from very positive
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.600]   at the start of 2023, when everybody was nervous,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.320]   to a little more negative by the beginning of the summer.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.280]   And just like when you and I are playing in a game,
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.160]   our house game of poker, when the skew gets more negative,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.920]   when cards get turned over, when our probabilities
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.760]   of winning dissipate, we've got to reduce the bet size.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.080]   So I talked a couple of weeks ago
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.040]   about reducing units of risk.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.160]   And I got some questions online about that.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.480]   So here's a really simplified depiction
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.400]   of how we were thinking of things in January of 2023
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   and how we were thinking of things
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.960]   at the start of July in 2024, right?
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.440]   So as you can see on this chart, at the beginning of '23,
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   we looked at it. Prices were in the toilet.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.800]   So you started with really low prices.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.920]   We expected big earnings beats because consensus
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.160]   was really beaten down.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.400]   People were super negative on where earnings would come in.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.800]   And we expected there to be rate cuts, which
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.760]   would be further stimulatory of the economy.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.200]   So we looked at it just, again, very simplistically.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.080]   We said, hey, we think there's an 80% chance
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.480]   that the names that we like in technology
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.720]   can be up a lot because we expected big earnings beats.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.000]   So up 50%.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.600]   But the future is unknown.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.240]   So there could have been a hard landing.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.440]   So we said, oh, there's a 20% chance the market can be down.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.480]   But it's already down so much that we think,
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.360]   let's call it down 10%.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.240]   And when we looked at that skew, that's
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.080]   what I would call highly positive skew, right?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   It's like 5 to 1 or 4 to 1 risk reward.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.320]   We put on 9 units of risk.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.760]   So what's 9 units of risk?
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   Well, let's assume--
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   Yeah, what is 9 units of risk?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.520]   So let's say that you're managing $5 billion
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.600]   of public equities.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.040]   9 units of risk would be that you have 4 and 1/2 billion
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   of that risk directionally long the market, right?
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.280]   So that could either be that your longs are more than 100%
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.760]   and you have some shorts on.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.600]   Or let's just keep it simple here
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.920]   and say that you have 95% of your cash invested
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.000]   or 90% of your cash invested and 4 and 1/2 billion
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.920]   directionally long the market, OK?
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.080]   Now, as the chart depicts, by the beginning of this summer,
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.640]   we were worried about a variety of things, the first of which
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.360]   is prices had just gone up a lot, Bill, right?
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.680]   We were at all-time highs.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.840]   And the moves had been fairly parabolic in a lot of the names
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.200]   that you and I talked about.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   And we had talked on this pod about concerns
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.560]   over an AI air pocket.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.800]   And people were pointing out that NVIDIA was up multiples
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.680]   in a very short period of time.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.440]   So we looked at it.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.360]   We said we got high prices.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.920]   We've got an upcoming election where
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.680]   there's going to be some real binary things at play,
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.880]   including higher taxes, which we think would
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.960]   be a negative for the market.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.600]   We started to see our earnings expectations, which were just
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.160]   in line with consensus.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.200]   Or in some cases, we expected misses to occur, OK?
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.040]   And we were increasingly concerned
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.840]   about the prospect of a recession
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.080]   because we started to pick up these signs of slowing
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   in the economy.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.720]   And then you and I had talked a lot about this AI air pocket.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.320]   So by the beginning of the summer,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.920]   we said there's no longer an 80% chance of a 50% upside,
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.200]   like we saw at the beginning of '23.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.560]   Now there's an 80% chance that we could have a 10% to 20%
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.080]   downside, right?
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.400]   And the move up, the 20% chance, was like, wow,
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.560]   we're at all-time highs.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.600]   We could see this squeeze a little bit higher.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.640]   But between here and the election,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.800]   we think the probability of going much higher
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.080]   is fairly low.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.320]   So we had much lower units of risk.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.040]   What's that mean?
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.000]   It means we sell some of our longs, or we put edges on,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.080]   or we add to our short positions,
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.200]   so that our net exposure directionally to the market
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.480]   is three units of risk, not the nine units of risk
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.160]   that we had had on earlier.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.120]   So that's really what I was saying in a simplified way,
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.920]   that we tend to have longer holding periods.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.320]   We hold things about three years in the public markets.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.080]   Obviously, in the venture markets,
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.960]   we're holding things 10 years.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.360]   But that doesn't mean that you buy and go to sleep.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.400]   Just like in a poker game, you got
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   to watch when things change.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.160]   They don't change every day.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.240]   But over the course of the last six quarters,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.400]   that risk-reward has indeed changed.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.800]   Yeah, and I mean, the Nasdaq shot up about 33%
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.280]   in that window from January to the first week of July.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.400]   And I think a lot of the people in Silicon Valley
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.240]   didn't really feel that, because they may still
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.440]   be anchoring on some of these multiples from two years ago.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.040]   And so when I hear people say, oh, my god,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.360]   SaaS is super cheap at six times revenue.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.320]   And I'm like, you know, I've seen industries mature
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.720]   where six ain't a stopping point.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.280]   And of course, you got to move on to net income and earnings
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.240]   and cash flow and get out of this revenue mindset.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.800]   But anyway, yeah, so I think you timed that exactly right.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.120]   And obviously, now we're looking at all of these new issues
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.360]   that have come to the table.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.000]   What do you think are the key issues that have been changing?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.440]   And how do we want to think about each and every one of them?
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.280]   Well, first, as price goes up, mathematically,
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.320]   risk-reward gets worse, unless we're taking up our numbers.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.200]   So the first problem is our numbers stopped going up a lot.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.040]   And so price really matters.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.840]   In 2023, we kept revising those numbers up.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.280]   And in 2024, the numbers didn't go up a lot.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.280]   And so we're much more in line with consensus.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.480]   But in addition to that, we see five forces really at play.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.600]   We've been focused on three, and then two more
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.760]   came into play over the course of the past six to eight weeks.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.560]   But the five forces we've been thinking about, Bill,
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.400]   number one is taxes, right?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.720]   We got this election coming up.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.000]   And remember, depending upon who wins the election,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.080]   we have the potential of an automatic tax increase in 2025.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   It's the expiration of the personal income tax reductions
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.760]   from the Trump tax cuts.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.720]   And if that happens--
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.320]   You're talking about personal income taxes, not
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.400]   corporate taxes.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.440]   Right, we can dive into that in a sec.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.080]   Number two, we're worried about earnings misses or just
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.520]   skinny beats and general slowing in the economy, right?
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.280]   So this is things like consumer delinquencies.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.200]   Number three was a concern about this AI air pocket,
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.880]   that prices had come up so much, expectations
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.840]   had come up so much.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.640]   Would we have, as Satya said to us a few weeks ago,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.120]   this mismatch between CapEx and when the actual revenues start
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.960]   to come in?
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.040]   And then just in the last few weeks,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.120]   we had two more geopolitical factors emerge.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.000]   One was around this huge Japanese carry trade
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.280]   unwind, which we can dive into a little bit.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.040]   And then the last one was just this expanding saber rattling
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.120]   in the Middle East, potential of an expansion
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.920]   of the conflict with Iran.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.000]   All of these things creates a bit of a toxic brew.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.760]   And of course, the future is unknown.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.320]   A bunch of these things could break positive,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.240]   but it means that there's more uncertainty in the world.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.040]   And when that uncertainty goes up,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.000]   the discount rate, the margin of safety
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.160]   you need on your portfolio goes up.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.480]   And that means that the multiples on these stocks
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.360]   come down.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.440]   So those are really the things that we've
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.480]   been paying attention to, in addition, obviously,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.440]   to what companies we expect to do best,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.000]   which ones we expect to underperform.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.480]   And that's what causes us to modulate
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.240]   from nine units of risk to three units of risk.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   And these are all things that change, right?
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.800]   There's a perception-- there's obviously
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.920]   been a perception shift on the election, which
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.000]   can affect something there.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.480]   There was a general perception that the soft landing
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.360]   was stuck, using the Olympic metaphor.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.480]   And so that's a change, if we're thinking about a recession
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.800]   again.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   The AI shift, we've talked a lot about.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.280]   The Japan carry trade kind of came out of nowhere.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.960]   So we'll dive into that.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.720]   And then on the Iran issue, and just to clarify for people,
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.400]   I mean, obviously, any war is bad, obviously.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.120]   And it can lead to a lot of horrible things
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.520]   for citizens and people.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.360]   I think one of the reasons you're bringing up
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.680]   relative to the US markets is because it
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.680]   could cause an oil shock.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.200]   And that could impact oil prices, which obviously
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.840]   has a huge impact on the economy.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.760]   Is that correct?
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.200]   Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.320]   OK, cool.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.840]   Well, let's take them one by one and dive in.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.400]   Why don't you start with the tax thing?
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.480]   Well, so we talked about this, I think,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.320]   on episode 11 or something.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.400]   The tax situation we're facing going into this election
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.240]   is a very different situation than we've had
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.080]   in prior presidential elections, right?
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.640]   There's always debates in presidential elections
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.520]   about higher taxes, lower taxes.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.040]   And of course, we never know whether or not
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.120]   they'll actually follow through on those promises,
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.120]   whether or not those things will happen.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.160]   But in this situation, we have tax cuts
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.680]   that automatically are set to revert back to prior levels,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.360]   right?
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.760]   So remember, the corporate tax cuts
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.800]   were made permanent when they were passed,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.120]   brought the corporate tax rate from 35% down to 21%.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.240]   So if a new administration came in,
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.320]   let's say the Harris administration came in
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.160]   and they wanted to raise corporate taxes,
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.000]   they would have to get that through Congress,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.080]   which would be a very difficult thing to do, right?
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.920]   Given the fact that we expect to continue
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.360]   to have divided government.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.680]   But the individual tax cuts,
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.160]   which included increasing the child tax credit
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.680]   and the standard deduction,
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.280]   it's worth about $150 billion a year,
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.040]   to put it in perspective, right?
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.320]   That's about 60 basis points on US GDP.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   And we're talking about the marginal federal income tax.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.880]   Correct, so this is everybody's rates came down under Trump.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.080]   We also increased the standard deduction.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.880]   We increased the child tax credit.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.840]   And think about that.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.680]   That's like pushing $150 billion
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.080]   of consumer firepower into the economy.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.520]   Now, you know, there's a lot of debate
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.080]   about whether we can afford this as a country,
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.040]   you know, whether it actually gets spent
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.880]   and added to GDP or saved, whether it's fair.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.800]   I'm making a different point, right?
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.280]   Set aside what you think politically,
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.720]   but from a market perspective,
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.200]   if taxes were to go up by $150 billion a year,
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.040]   this is a big risk to the market.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.240]   And the market seems to currently be saying
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.640]   the likelihood, right?
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.480]   We know what the betting markets are saying.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.560]   They're saying Kamala is now favored
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.520]   to win the election by a slight amount, right?
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.080]   And as the probability of her winning has gone up,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.600]   the market has gotten more concerned
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.280]   about these tax increases, right?
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.120]   And some people have estimated
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.400]   that the tax decreases from the Trump tax cuts
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.000]   contributed to about 20% of the gains in the S&P 500.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.480]   So whatever your number is,
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.200]   if those tax cuts go away,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.440]   you have to assume that will be a headwind,
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.880]   at least in the short term for the markets.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.400]   Can you not make an argument?
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.000]   I mean, depending on exactly who is impacted
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.520]   as to whether or not those taxes
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.880]   come out of discretionary money
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.600]   that would be available to spend.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.000]   Yeah, no, I--
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.760]   I'm just saying for an ultra wealthy person,
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.800]   it's not gonna matter.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.600]   It's not gonna affect your spending.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.440]   Of course.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.760]   And so, like, that's what I was saying at the start.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.200]   There's some debate, right?
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.120]   We know if the tax cuts were $150 billion,
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.320]   it's unlikely that all $150 billion of that
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.440]   was stimulatory, right?
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   Because some people just put it into increased savings.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.280]   But we know when you look at the bulk of the people
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.840]   who are recipients of those tax cuts, right,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.280]   they've spent down their COVID stimulus checks, right?
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.720]   They've increased their credit cards, right?
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.560]   And whatever incremental take-home pay they got
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.920]   as a result of these tax cuts is being spent.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.240]   So that had to have some stimulatory effect
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.160]   on the economy. Gotcha.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.840]   Okay, let's dive into the next one,
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.880]   which I think is the one that's,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.400]   for me at least, most interesting, which is,
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   and you know, 'cause I've been very outspoken,
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.440]   I try and avoid macro at all costs.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.080]   So this is an awkward--
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.760]   You're feeling very uncomfortable today.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.360]   Yes, it's an awkward journey for me.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   But, you know, just out listening to the ethos,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.240]   and it did appear that the common point of view
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.760]   was that a soft landing had been achieved
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.640]   or that it was gonna be achieved.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.720]   And there was a lot of, you know, high fives and ta-da's
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.360]   and I told you so's.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.920]   And so to take, to reconsider that
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.880]   and take that off the table is a big deal.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.800]   So what are you seeing out there
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.000]   and what's causing people to use the recession word again?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.440]   Yeah, no, I think you're spot on, right?
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.680]   I mean, right?
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.840]   The markets were at all time high, Bill, in July.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.800]   So, I mean, I think that's telling you, I don't know,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.640]   that there was an 80% chance of a soft landing.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   Now we started to get some data coming in
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.560]   that suggested maybe the economy was softening faster,
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.840]   getting softer, faster than people think.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.440]   So for example, the Wayfair CEO, you know,
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.760]   Wayfair is a company that provides cheap home furnishings.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.840]   We know that housing is under pressure
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.160]   because interest rates remain very high.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.640]   You know, the CEO came out and said,
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.920]   "Customers remain cautious in their spending on the home
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.760]   and our credit card data suggests
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.320]   that the category correction now mirrors the magnitude
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.400]   of the peak to trough decline
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.680]   the home furnishing space experienced
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.200]   during the great financial crisis."
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.320]   Right, that's pretty extraordinary, right?
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.680]   You have the CEO of a home furnishing company saying,
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.080]   "This looks like it did in 2008."
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   Right, Airbnb is another--
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.000]   Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.080]   Airbnb reported just last night, you know,
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.040]   they talked about some softness, you know,
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.920]   that they're seeing.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.520]   Jamie Dimon was just on CNBC on the flip side
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.080]   and he said, "Listen, my expectation all year
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.320]   is that there was a 30, 35% chance
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.840]   that we're gonna have a soft landing."
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.760]   And my view remains the same today.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.640]   But I think Jamie was probably
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.960]   in the more conservative camp.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.480]   The market was pricing in an 80% chance of a soft landing.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.000]   He was at 30 or 35% chance.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.280]   And I think that's probably where the market
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.040]   is beginning to price it.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.600]   And on top of that, so we have about 80% of the companies--
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.200]   Let me ask you a quick question
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.520]   while you're on that topic.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.120]   So I also saw Disney gave soft guidance
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.520]   on the theme park business
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.200]   and Universal had said the exact same thing.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.280]   So, you know, I know you used to be very focused
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.360]   on the travel sector.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.400]   When you look at theme park revenue
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.200]   and you look at Airbnb revenue,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.360]   what does it tell you when the consumer's
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.440]   having second thoughts about those types of expenditures?
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.760]   Right, well, the first thing they do is,
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.320]   you know, when things are starting to get tight
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.960]   is you defer your couch.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.640]   And that's what Wayfair's seeing.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.520]   The second thing you do is you defer your family trip.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.360]   Right? Yeah.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.120]   You hold onto that family trip
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.520]   because that's the most important thing
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.840]   you do during the year.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.600]   But when Airbnb and Disney and the cruise lines
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.840]   and the airlines start seeing down ticks,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.520]   now you know that the consumer
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.040]   is really getting pressured.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.200]   So there is no doubt-- Have you seen that?
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.720]   So it's not just the theme parks and Airbnb
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.280]   you're seeing it with other-- No, this is--
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.560]   We're hearing this across the board in travel.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.920]   We're seeing it in employments, air ticket prices.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.240]   Again, not at a level that should cause one
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.440]   to think we're in a recession or panic,
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.400]   but undoubtedly in my mind, we're slowing.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.000]   And if you just look at the companies
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.680]   that have reported in the S&P,
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.160]   80% of companies have now reported.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.000]   48% of them had a positive revenue beat.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.920]   Now that sounds like a lot,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.120]   but it's the lowest level since the third quarter of 2019.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.000]   And remember, this is a trailing indicator.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.840]   This is what happened over the course
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.840]   of the last three months.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.120]   So again, that's another thing
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.440]   I think we ought to pay attention to.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.200]   And then of course, our jobs report have come in weak.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.320]   The jolts, which is the job openings, are below trend.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.480]   And that trend has been in place for quite a while.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.480]   And then the unemployment rate has been climbing.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.440]   Most recently, 4.3%.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.840]   Many economists think, in fact,
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.880]   I was talking with a former chairman
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.240]   of the Council of Economic Advisors last night.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   They think this is the best indicator
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.400]   of a pending recession.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.800]   There's something known as the SOM rule.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.320]   We'll put it in the notes.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.880]   But they said, according to the SOM rule,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.120]   a recession is almost always underway
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.640]   if the three-month average unemployment rate
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.000]   rises by half a percentage point
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.600]   from its low of the past year.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.080]   And that's exactly what's happened.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.880]   So a lot of chatter on Twitter
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.440]   about how the SOM rule has been triggered.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.960]   So there's good reason to think
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.720]   that there's a lot of slowing going on.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.800]   There's a lot of debate as to whether or not
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.520]   this is just the healthy slowing
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.640]   that Jerome Powell needed to engineer
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.600]   to bring inflation down.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.040]   But, you know, there is a saying
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.680]   that the Fed has caused 10 of the last eight recessions.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.560]   You know, that they have post-traumatic stress.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.240]   They were late to get in front of inflation
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.000]   in June of 2021.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.400]   They were late to increase rates.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.480]   And so I think it's reasonable
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.200]   that they may be late to reduce interest rates
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.080]   to head off a recession.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.560]   And do you expect them to do something quickly?
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.120]   There was talk this week of like an emergency cut,
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.040]   although I think that's waned.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.440]   Yeah, I mean, listen,
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.560]   I think it's important to realize first
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.280]   that the Fed is at a multi-decade high
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.880]   in terms of its level of restrictiveness in the economy.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.840]   So what do I mean by that?
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.520]   Well, the Fed funds rate is at 5.5%, right?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.120]   The 10-year is at 4%.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.320]   So the market-based mechanism
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.200]   for saying where rates are going to be
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.640]   is 150 basis points lower
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.920]   than where the Fed funds rate is.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.040]   Another way of looking at this is the 10-year tips, right?
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.640]   We've talked about this before.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.040]   It's a bit of an esoteric thing,
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.520]   but it's currently at 1.8%,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.280]   and 50 basis points is viewed as neutral.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.720]   So this is kind of highly restrictive.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.800]   And the way to think about this
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.200]   is this is the amount you have to be compensated
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.600]   over the interest rate
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.040]   in order to bear the risk of inflation.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.560]   So the measure of economic restrictiveness is high,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.240]   and inflation is coming down.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.880]   In fact, the last inflation print was 3%.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.080]   CPI gets reported again next week.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.400]   We expect that to be,
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.760]   the market expects that to be around 2.9%.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.160]   So I think there's very little doubt
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   the Fed is going to cut rates.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.280]   The market is saying now
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.920]   that there is a very high probability,
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.640]   we'll put this chart in,
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.400]   that we're going to have 125 basis points
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.560]   to 150 basis points of rate cuts
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.720]   over the course of the next four to five months.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.760]   Now, to put this in perspective, Bill,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.640]   that just gets us back to neutral, right?
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.400]   This is not some, oh my God, we're in a recession.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.840]   This is just saying we're no longer
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.440]   as worried about inflation.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.240]   We're more worried about jobs.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.560]   We have a dual mandate.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.280]   And so we're going to get back closer to neutral.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.480]   I would actually point you,
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.520]   there was a really great interview this week
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.280]   with Chicago Fed President Goolsbee.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.800]   Thinks perhaps that the Fed
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.960]   is already behind the curve on this.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.800]   When he was asked whether they would do an emergency cut,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.360]   and I think the emergency cut is off the table,
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.880]   but he said this.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.080]   He said, "I have been saying to you
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.840]   "that we have been in a very restrictive stance.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.440]   "The real Fed funds rate is at its peak for this cycle.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.560]   "And we should only have that restrictiveness in place
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.000]   "if there's a fear of overheating
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.920]   "and the data is weakening
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.560]   "so it does not look like there's any fear of overheating."
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.680]   And then he went on to say, "While weaker than expected,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.520]   "we're not yet in a recession,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.000]   "but we need to be forward-looking.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.680]   "There are other cautionary indicators.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.960]   "Consumer delinquencies are rising.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.400]   "Small business defaults are rising.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.240]   "They are at worrisome levels,
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.600]   "though the domestic purchases seem steady."
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.480]   So I think within the Fed,
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.640]   they know that the balance of power
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.920]   between concern over inflation and jobs has shifted.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.800]   So I expect that on schedule in 30 days,
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.960]   I think it's mid-September,
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.200]   you're gonna get a rate cut.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.440]   The market's saying it's gonna be 50 basis points
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.280]   followed by a few other rate cuts.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.000]   That sounds right to me.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.600]   But Jeremy Siegel was on Squawk Box
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.040]   calling for an emergency 75 basis point rate cut
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.000]   followed by another 75 basis points.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.360]   And listen, I think that that would probably
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.280]   spook the market worse than if they just stay the course here
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.000]   because that would suggest the economy's falling off a cliff
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and I don't see evidence that it's falling off a cliff.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.120]   And so the interpretation is worse
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.120]   than the value of the action, if you will, the signaling.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.400]   You know, the whole Fed thing
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.520]   is kind of like intriguing to me
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.080]   'cause the world starts talking about it
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.960]   like it's a thermostat.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.240]   Oh, honey, it's hot in here.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.920]   Can you turn it down?
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.320]   As if it's the one thing that's always gonna fix the market
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.840]   and there's 40,000 other variables out there, right?
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.000]   Like if you, you know, it looks like both parties
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.320]   that are running for the White House
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:27.400]   want to do isolationism and fight globalism.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.360]   That's inflationary.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.200]   Right.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:35.040]   There's been, you know, a massive overspending
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.360]   by the last three or four administrations
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.120]   and so national, you know, debt's higher
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.960]   than it's ever been.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.400]   That's a problem.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.200]   Like who's to say that even if the Fed does cut,
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.080]   we're gonna see just like an immediate,
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.280]   okay, we're fine.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.720]   Like the doctor gave you a shot and you're okay.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.600]   We got used to, or maybe addicted to rate cuts
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.960]   and every time rates would go down
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.760]   and kind of bail out the markets and markets would go up.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.840]   But remember, historically rate cuts
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.920]   that are preceding a recession or fears about a recession
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.280]   are oftentimes sold, right?
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.680]   It doesn't cause the market to go up.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.640]   Actually it causes the market to go down.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.600]   You know, our team was looking at some data in 2019.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   In 2018, there was fear about the economy slowing.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.800]   The Fed starts cutting rates at the beginning of 2019
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.760]   and the market was down big, right?
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.960]   It was down big because it thought
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.520]   we were heading into a recession.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   So it took probably six months for the market
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.760]   to rebound from that.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.960]   And a much worse version of this happened in 2001
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   that you and I remember well, right?
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.480]   The Fed continued to raise rates in May of 2000,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.360]   worried about the dot-com boom
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.800]   and that the market was overheating,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.880]   but they were way behind the curve.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.080]   And we all saw the economy really slowing down
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.520]   and signs of the dot-com bubble bursting.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.800]   They were late to the game.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.480]   By the time they started cutting rates
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.280]   in the beginning of 2001,
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.880]   it was clear they were behind
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.280]   that the economy was cascading into a recession
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.560]   and the NASDAQ was down over 20%.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   And so I don't think, you know, as market participants,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.240]   when we're weighing all the risk reward here,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.560]   we're not sitting here saying,
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.960]   "Oh, the Fed's gonna cut rates."
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.520]   And that in and of itself, you know, fends off a recession.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.000]   We need to make sure that we continue
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.680]   to see earnings come in strong.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.720]   - You know, that one, that particular situation,
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.640]   there's one thing that people seem
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.080]   to have a really hard time remembering.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.440]   After the famous quote about irrational exuberance
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.960]   from Alan Greenspan,
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.000]   the Clinton administration actually lowered
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.320]   capital gains tax rates, which fed into that problem.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.840]   And probably shouldn't have, should have been raising them.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.600]   Anyway, so let me ask you this question.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.240]   Once again, macro bill here.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.520]   - Yeah.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.640]   - What are the chances that you get probably
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.720]   the worst situation of all where the Fed cuts
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.280]   and nothing positive happens?
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.600]   Like there's no positive impact to growth.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.240]   Is that a possibility in this case?
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.800]   - Yeah, I mean, listen,
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.560]   I think the market's already doing the Fed's job, right?
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.440]   Remember that a lot of variable rate debt
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.680]   is priced off of where the tenure is.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.120]   And the tenure has already, you know, come down.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.040]   So people's mortgage, you know,
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.880]   you can already go get a cheaper mortgage.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.280]   You can, your credit card debt
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.080]   is already coming down, et cetera.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.280]   So this is the dynamic.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.960]   - And the marginal impact of the Fed lowering
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.240]   to those long-term rates is not gonna be that big,
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.200]   is what you're saying.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.360]   - Correct, I don't expect it to be that big,
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.440]   but it does signal directionally, right?
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.440]   That the market is right.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.400]   Remember, the market will ultimately adjust
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.280]   to where the Fed is.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.520]   So the Fed, it's not to say that the Fed funds rate
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.000]   is, you know, is not important.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.760]   I would say this, what's far more important
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.680]   about whether we end the year higher or lower
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.840]   is not whether the Fed cuts rates.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.680]   It's what is the economic growth?
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.240]   What is the unemployment?
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.560]   What is the CPI?
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.480]   What's really going on in the underlying economy?
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.800]   And again, just again, telescoping out here.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.480]   So you have this concern about taxes.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.440]   We're not gonna know the answer to that
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.120]   until after the election.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.640]   You got this concern about recession.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.000]   You know, the Fed can cut rates in September.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.720]   That doesn't make that concern go away.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.640]   That concern is still gonna be out there
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.640]   until we see additional inputs on economic growth,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.120]   you know, come in.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   And then of course, this third one that, you know,
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.600]   we were talking about, Bill,
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.360]   which is just concerns over this AI air pocket,
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.040]   which you've been beating the drum on.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.320]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.960]   Well, I mean, look, I think to a certain extent,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.360]   that's played out, right?
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.720]   I mean, we've seen most of the stocks
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.640]   that you would have called AI stocks,
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   Nvidia being the most obvious,
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.320]   but I think the Mag 7, a lot of them are exposed to this.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.680]   They've all come in, right?
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.240]   And so you and I had the discussion, you know,
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.400]   we've been having it all summer,
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.120]   but then the Goldman thing came out
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.200]   and the Sequoia thing came out
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.240]   and then the stocks retreated.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.320]   So could you make the argument
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.440]   that that bubble's been popped already?
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.840]   - Well, you know, again, like I said at the beginning,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.360]   I think these are healthy consolidations, right?
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.480]   Like what you don't want,
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.080]   what a bubble is made of is when everybody believes
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.440]   when there's no talk about an air pocket
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.240]   and when stocks just, you know,
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.840]   elevate to ridiculous multiples.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.680]   I think here, you know,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.720]   you've seen Nvidia come down from 140
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.280]   to I think it bottomed at 100 or 95 bucks.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.840]   It's probably at 105 today.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.880]   And so, but we did learn some things
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.280]   in the earnings reports of the last two weeks, Bill,
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.000]   that I think we should call out
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.800]   in terms of what Meta said, what Google said,
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.920]   what Microsoft said about their CapEx
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.880]   and about AI spending.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.720]   Here's some charts from my partner, Freda Duan.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.440]   And if you look at the big four,
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.240]   they're gonna spend 220 billion this year on CapEx,
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.520]   you know?
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.360]   And if you look at their statements on these calls, right?
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.040]   Sundar said, "It's more dangerous to underspend
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.240]   "than to overspend," right?
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.280]   Satya said, "There's still capacity constrained,
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.040]   "so they need to continue to make these investments."
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.680]   So I think in the short run,
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.640]   all of these companies, Meta said basically the same,
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.600]   Amazon the same,
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.280]   they're gonna keep the hammer down on CapEx
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.120]   because they're seeing the return,
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.480]   they're capacity constrained,
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.600]   and they're worried about not making the investments, right?
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.920]   So if you compare this to the quarterly
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.480]   and the annual expectations
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.680]   we took people through on the pod for NVIDIA, right?
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.040]   Here's this chart.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.760]   We talked about this $2 billion that's gotta get,
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.920]   or $2 trillion that Jensen said would likely be spent
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.560]   between now and 2028 on data center build-out.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.040]   And, you know, the green line,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.920]   descending line in the middle, right?
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   This is if you just take the consensus numbers for NVIDIA
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.560]   and what that means for their share of the market
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.760]   over this period of time.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.080]   So the consensus numbers,
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   while NVIDIA's numbers continue to go up a lot, right?
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.840]   And they're gonna report in two weeks here.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.560]   But if we look at NVIDIA's quarterly expectations
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.840]   or their annual expectations,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.200]   so this year they're expected to do
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.520]   about 136 billion of data center revenues.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.720]   Next year, that goes to 166 billion.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.960]   So up by about, you know, $30 billion.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.080]   Obviously the rate of growth is slowing a lot,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.320]   but when you compare that to the statements
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.000]   out of the big four, you know,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.760]   it certainly seems to foot, right?
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.600]   It seems that they're going to continue to spend.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.680]   And I think the real question as to the air pocket now,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.400]   right, like this could have been very different.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.080]   They could have got on their earnings call, Bill,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.160]   and they could have said we're pulling back on CapEx
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.040]   'cause we're not seeing the return, okay?
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.960]   None of them said that.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.680]   They all said the opposite.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.880]   But I think the question that remains out there
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.840]   is whether they're going to see the revenue
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.600]   on the other side of the equation, right,
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.080]   to justify that return.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.920]   And they've all cautioned us
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.480]   that they expect that there may be a lag
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.320]   between these two things.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.600]   You know, what was interesting,
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.040]   the CFOs of Microsoft and Meta, Amy and Susan,
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.280]   were quick to point out
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.240]   that if the revenues don't materialize,
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.360]   that they don't actually have to build out
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.720]   the data center shells, right, that they're acquiring.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   They said these are 15-year long-lived assets.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.120]   And so we have flexibility in how, you know,
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.160]   we manage those assets.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.760]   And obviously Meta has other uses for internal use
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.600]   and could redeploy those things.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.920]   And cool.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.720]   Well, I have three thoughts about this, you know,
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.320]   and one of them does go back 30 years
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.080]   to when I was a sell-side analyst.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.400]   And I followed the PC industry through,
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.640]   really through a te-day,
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.400]   like the big growth years of the PC industry.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.080]   And PC demand and growth was overestimated
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.720]   and underestimated five different times, you know,
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.600]   where you would have these cycles.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   And it was interesting 'cause a lot of the commodities
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.640]   would become in short supply.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.280]   So DRAM was one and hard drives.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.760]   Hard drives were this really interesting wild market
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.160]   where you would have boom-bust cycles and shortages.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   And they were always,
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.320]   they're almost always out of step with reality.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.560]   And I remember there's just this bizarre thing
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.000]   where you had to buy hard drive companies
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   when their PE was the highest,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.880]   because that was actually when everyone had
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.440]   the worst view possible of their earnings possibility.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.280]   Right, right, right.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.760]   And then you literally sold it when the PE was the lowest
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.200]   because the net income was at a peak high.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.680]   Anyway, one of the reasons that happens,
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.040]   one of the reasons why that's so out of whack
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.400]   is that bringing capacity on to build a hard drive
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   or a DRAM is slow.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.480]   It's not an overnight process.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   And the one thing I would say about these data centers,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.000]   and I was just kind of, my brain was triggered on that
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.800]   from something I read on Twitter this morning
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.120]   where someone was literally walking through
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.960]   the steps you have to go to to acquire land,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.200]   to get electricians on board, to do all these things.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   And whenever you have this kind of really long cycle time
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.960]   to actually bring up incremental capacity,
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.560]   it's easier to miss supply and demand.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.280]   And so, anyway, I think part of what's causing me
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.080]   to have a bit of anxiety is that fact.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.560]   And I also think when people are talking about NVIDIA,
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.320]   they talk about data center growth as demand,
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.840]   but because everyone, the end users buying these things
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.080]   as a cloud service, I kind of am like,
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.080]   well, that's supply, that's not demand.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.680]   Like people are aggressively growing supply.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.860]   So I don't know, it's super interesting.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.780]   I think from a venture's point of view,
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.380]   you're hopeful that there's so much demand for this stuff
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.340]   that they never catch up.
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.180]   - Exactly.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.620]   - When I look at it from a,
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.620]   just from a neutral observer standpoint,
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.860]   though I do worry that you could get out over your skis.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.460]   And then two other things I would add to that.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.260]   This is one of the very first waves
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.340]   where the incumbents were eyes wide open
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.740]   at the beginning of the technology shift.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.060]   If you go back and read "The Innovator's Dilemma",
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.620]   the reasons startup companies are able to come in
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.060]   and take shares often precisely because
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.500]   the incumbents are slow footed and aren't there.
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.300]   Here, they moved quick.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.540]   I think Microsoft and Satya are just the poster child
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.300]   for this, like here's a company that's very,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.180]   what, 35, 40 years old.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:26.180]   And everyone thought had had its better days behind it.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.260]   And they came in and moved fast and people loved it.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.460]   And the stock was rewarded for it.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.780]   And I even think their earnings
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.500]   have been positively impacted by it.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.100]   And so that is, so they move big,
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.580]   they move fast and it worked.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.380]   And so now I think that's in their psyche, right?
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.460]   And so that means they're gonna keep playing that game
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.300]   'cause it's working.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.660]   So that's another thing.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:57.340]   And then lastly, and this is pure conjecture on my part.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.580]   So I did not hear this from anybody.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.300]   Everyone can just say Gurley's out on a limb here,
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.820]   but my reading the tea leaves,
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.300]   and this relates to the point I just made,
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:14.300]   is that they don't want the independent AI companies
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:19.220]   to take what they see as rightfully theirs.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.180]   And we've been through a couple of waves here
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.820]   where capital availability's dramatically improved
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.300]   for private companies.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.620]   And you and I lived through this with Uber
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.780]   and Division Fund and Masa and all the money
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.660]   and DoorDash got all, and it really perverted the market.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:43.420]   And so now I think incumbents are aware
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.100]   that if companies get breakout potential,
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.500]   they can raise unlimited capital.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.660]   And so to a certain extent, I think they're pushing back.
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.860]   They're saying, look, this is a game we're in.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.420]   You look at Zuckerberg, like with the open source stuff,
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.820]   he's just being very aggressive.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.300]   And I think one of the objective functions
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.100]   may be just precisely to make it more difficult
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:13.100]   for OpenAI or Anthropic to raise $10 billion
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.940]   that they need to fund the next two model builds.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.420]   And now you've got people trying to project
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.740]   income statements and balance sheets of these companies
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.060]   and they're speculating about whether
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.660]   they might need to raise again or not.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.660]   So I think all that's super interesting and unprecedented.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.420]   - Very insightful.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.780]   What's fair to say at this point, again,
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:41.220]   in the context of the risk-facing public markets,
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.820]   we were worried about the AI air pocket.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.820]   It seems we've traversed the 2025 CapEx concern cycle.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.580]   Like they are going to continue to spend.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:54.740]   What we don't have insights into
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.980]   is that end user demand that you talk about.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.460]   And I think it's really interesting why you say
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.500]   the bigs are gonna continue to spend.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.140]   And in fact, some of these take-unders,
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.020]   the characters, the inflections, et cetera,
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:12.740]   certainly suggest that competing against the bigs.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.580]   I mean, in the case of OpenAI and Anthropic,
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.540]   they partnered with them.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.180]   They're owned a lot by Microsoft and Amazon
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.180]   at this point in time.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.980]   So it's hard to find somebody who you think
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:28.700]   can go the distance at that scale that's truly independent.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.580]   - And by the way, regardless of whether the investors
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.460]   got paid, maybe we can go deeper in that later
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.340]   on these take-under deals.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.820]   It is a capitulation, no matter what.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.980]   Like even if it were a normal M&A deal
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.540]   and it was at 3 billion and still a great return
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.380]   for investors, the founders are saying
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.340]   in the inflection case in Character AI,
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:55.260]   they're saying, "Hmm, not sure I wanna keep playing
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.340]   the independent game anymore."
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.940]   - Yeah, that may have just been very difficult
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.340]   to raise private capital in an up-around,
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.340]   you know, in this environment.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.340]   I mean, because you know you're gonna have to go compete
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.980]   with Google, with Microsoft, with Meta,
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.900]   you know they're not gonna stop spending.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.060]   And they have a printing press that's spitting out
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.940]   $10 billion bills in the back room.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:19.100]   - Well, and they've got hundreds of billions
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.620]   sitting in cash anyway.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.460]   - Exactly.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.700]   - So yeah, and this, I think you brought this up
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.460]   or maybe we saw Satya talk about it.
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.580]   Like, okay, we're spending 50 billion a year on CapEx,
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.780]   but look at all this cash we got sitting around
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.780]   and the FTC says we can't do acquisitions,
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.020]   what are we supposed to do?
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.620]   Like, then that's another factor,
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.260]   maybe that's a fourth factor.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.140]   - Yeah, three things you can do, Bill.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.580]   You can buy your own stock, you can issue a dividend
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.900]   or you can buy NVIDIA chips.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.900]   - They're doing, yeah, exactly.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.540]   I think they're doing all three.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.580]   Yeah, it'd be interesting, you know,
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:59.180]   there are obvious huge wins in AI.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.340]   You know, we've already talked about Tesla
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.220]   and full self-driving.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:06.220]   I think all the core AI opportunities,
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:09.300]   non-LLM where they've actually figured out
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.860]   how to go from A to B and get better
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.820]   at what you're doing through AI, those are fantastic.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.380]   I think the language oriented things
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.900]   around customer service
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.260]   and where you're literally replacing the notion
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.420]   of someone either talking or doing a search.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.420]   I know you're a big fan of Glean
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.300]   and that is a type of, I think I could restate
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.580]   that what it is is a super enhanced
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:43.180]   corporate search product that helps you find things
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.940]   that have been scattered around the organization.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.980]   - Yeah, I think it's your enterprise assistant, right?
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.860]   I mean, Microsoft says they're capacity constrained
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.860]   because they got a lot of demand for co-pilot, right?
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.260]   And I think the real enterprise co-pilot, right?
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.900]   Glean has gone from enterprise search
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.620]   to being that enterprise assistant.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.500]   I would say this, you and I have some debate about this,
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.260]   whether or not we're actually seeing the end user demand,
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.460]   whether or not the solutions are good enough
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:11.780]   to unlock that demand.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.940]   I tend to be on the positive side of that question
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.580]   based on the companies we're seeing,
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.820]   based upon folks like Satya saying
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.220]   that we're capacity constrained.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.100]   But I will also stipulate just as a risk factor
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.060]   in the public markets,
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.660]   the idea that we're going to go through this phase shift
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.940]   with CapEx and revenues perfectly aligned
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.620]   and perfectly matched, right?
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.060]   It would be the first major phase shift we've went through
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.380]   where that's the case.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.340]   In the case of the internet,
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.340]   CapEx got way out ahead of early revenues.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.820]   In the case of cloud, CapEx ahead of early revenues.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.180]   Mobile, same thing.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.380]   So in fact, I think what you're hearing out of these CEOs,
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.900]   once they're cautioning us, they're saying,
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.780]   there's going to be a period of time here
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:59.260]   where we have really high CapEx relative to our revenues,
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:00.820]   but it's the right bet to make
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.300]   when you look at a three to five year time horizon.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.620]   And I would say on that dimension,
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.820]   each of those prior super cycles were underestimated
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.700]   when you looked at them three to five years out.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:17.100]   And just to put a nail in the point I was making,
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.500]   I see a ton of great use cases
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.300]   and I'm super excited about everything I've seen.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.260]   There are statements that are continually made
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.380]   that I think are over the top.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.340]   I don't think this replaces all software.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.820]   I don't think people are going to be sitting around jobless
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.860]   and need UBI.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.860]   I don't think that all software just goes away.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:47.100]   Someone said that this is the new operating system.
[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.460]   I don't think there's any proof of that.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.020]   It doesn't know how to store data.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.980]   It may get there, but anyway.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:56.260]   So the hyperbole causes me a little bit
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.180]   of cognitive dissonance, it's the only thing.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.100]   But I do see a lot of positive stuff.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.420]   Let's move on.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.340]   Explain to people what happened with the Japan carrier trade.
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.420]   Oh my God.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.980]   I mean, the fact that you wake--
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:09.900]   Out of nowhere, right?
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.100]   You wake up--
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.660]   You show up on a Monday morning, exactly.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.740]   I thought I had to worry about taxes and recession
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.820]   and AI air pocket.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.860]   It wasn't on my bingo card.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.820]   Maybe it should have been that we were going to have to
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.220]   be worried about a 13% drawdown in the Nikkei,
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.700]   its biggest one-day drop since 1987.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.020]   Then we have a rip back the next day.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.700]   Well, let's break down what happened here.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.380]   First, let's remember the Japanese markets
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.740]   were really crowded, Bill.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.060]   They hit an all-time high just three weeks ago.
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.740]   High prices always make for big drops, right?
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.100]   So there was a setup.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.900]   But basically the market was down big
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.060]   since the Bank of Japan, so the Japanese Fed meeting,
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.900]   where they basically increased interest rates
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.020]   for the first time in 17 years.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.900]   So why was this such a big deal?
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.940]   Well, there are great threads on Twitter about this.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.020]   Zero Hedge has been basically live blogging the events.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.260]   By the way, I think it's important
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.300]   before you go into what happened.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.820]   Why were interest rates,
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.180]   why had they not done an interest rate increase
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:18.860]   in 17 years?
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.740]   And why did they feel they needed to?
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.460]   Right, I mean, so in Japan,
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.420]   you have a population that saves a lot,
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.780]   a population that's not growing a lot.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.420]   And so they've been battling slow economic growth
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.460]   and deflation for the better part of 15 years.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.020]   And for the last eight years,
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.180]   they've had negative interest rates, right?
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.980]   So that is just a way to force people into the risk pool
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.900]   to try to get people to take risk
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.580]   and get your economy going and to keep it from deflating.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.740]   Remember, like in some ways, this is what,
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.380]   you know, we copied their experiment
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.460]   at the beginning of COVID.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.940]   When everybody went into lockdown
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.420]   and wasn't taking any risk,
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.140]   we said, "We'll pay you to take risk."
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.900]   And we took interest rates negative.
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.020]   Well, they're systematically been doing that for eight years.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:09.700]   Now it leads to one of these very interesting consequences,
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.180]   which is when you have negative rates,
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.460]   i.e. you're paying somebody to borrow money,
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.420]   that leads to what is called a carry trade.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.580]   So there are estimates that up to $20 trillion of yen
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.620]   was borrowed, and then you invest that
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.300]   in rate-yielding assets around the world
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.300]   and you pocket the spread, right?
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.260]   So remember, just I think earlier this year,
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.700]   maybe it was late last year,
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:37.700]   Buffett borrowed $200 billion of yen-denominated currency.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.260]   So it seems like a great idea,
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.020]   especially if you're getting paid to borrow in Japan.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.060]   So there's no cost to borrow in Japan.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.220]   Then you get paid to buy bonds in the US.
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.900]   But you need to make sure
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.540]   that things don't change quickly on you.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.300]   So the predictability of the rate environment in Japan
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.180]   is key, it's absolutely essential.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.060]   And what scared the hell out of people
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.540]   is out of left field,
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:08.540]   the Bank of Japan raises rates.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.980]   And all of a sudden, these people
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.780]   who were effectively borrowing in Japanese yen,
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.660]   assuming that rates would stay low
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.220]   and investing in these higher yields,
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.740]   they had to unwind these trades.
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.660]   And you had 20 trillion of these trades at play,
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.100]   according to J.P. Morgan.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.740]   I think in the first two days,
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.460]   half of those trades they estimated got unwound.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.460]   That means they had to sell US bonds,
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.740]   they had to sell stocks around the world, et cetera.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:37.140]   And of course, that causes this negative reflexivity
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:41.060]   because you already have concerns about recession
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.060]   and the other things we've talked about.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.420]   So this just adds to that list of problems.
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.620]   Now, remember, part of the reason
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:51.620]   that you have this carry trade going on
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.620]   is the US has kept rates higher for longer.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:56.500]   So it increases the spread.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.940]   They're at zero or negative
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.900]   and our rates have been higher for longer.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.500]   So that's led even more people
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.900]   to pig pile into this carry trade.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.540]   But what was so shocking here,
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.100]   within 36 hours, right?
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.940]   It seems like the Bank of Japan capitulated.
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.620]   And overnight they reversed course
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.100]   and they said, we're just kidding,
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.340]   we're not gonna raise rates when the market is unstable.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.500]   Now, what the hell does that mean?
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.620]   We're not gonna raise rates when the market is unstable.
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.780]   Well, you're the ones that destabilized it.
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.220]   So I guess that means, sorry, footfall,
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.780]   we're not gonna raise rates.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.780]   But I think that, you know,
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.420]   most of the stock market contraction we saw here.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.900]   So if you look at where the NASDAQ was trading before,
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.060]   you know, this all happened,
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.580]   I think it was like at 475, it dropped to 450
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.100]   and now we're basically back to 475 on the Q's.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:54.100]   So basically it was one of these long tail events
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.900]   that reminded us there's risk in the world.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.540]   And when you have a bunch of other buckets of risk,
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.100]   recession, slowing, AI air pocket,
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.780]   and then you throw one of these on,
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.420]   it can really be the trigger to light the fuse.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.900]   Remind you, just a couple of weeks ago,
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.740]   I can't even believe, you know,
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.340]   that it happened at this point,
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:20.340]   but if that shot fired at Trump was one inch different,
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.660]   if Trump had been assassinated,
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.620]   can you imagine what would happen to the US markets?
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.460]   Yeah. Right?
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.020]   So when markets are at all time highs
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.500]   and you're just hanging out
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.620]   and there's not a lot of upside return
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.820]   and you got these other things you're concerned about,
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.660]   you gotta take down those units of risk
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.340]   because there are always things like this that can happen.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.180]   Right?
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.740]   Take Iran into account, geopolitical risk.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.220]   You know, we've come, the world has come to,
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.700]   I think, appreciate these skirmishes
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:52.460]   between Iran and Israel over the course of the last decade.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.460]   And they never really amount to all that much.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.780]   And so when the markets get concerned about it,
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.940]   it's generally a buying opportunity
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:03.140]   because they are generally short-lived, right?
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.860]   They keep each other in check.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:09.100]   Could you imagine, let's assume tail risk this time.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.620]   What if Iran really did something different?
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:15.220]   And now we've, you know, heard rumors of, you know,
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:18.260]   the Israeli leadership in nuclear proof bunkers.
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:22.100]   And they said, if you touch one of our civilian populations,
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:25.340]   we're gonna wipe out your nuclear capabilities, right?
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.660]   Like you could imagine, I'm not saying it's the base case,
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.300]   but you can imagine a scenario
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.620]   where this time it is in fact different.
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.700]   I think for all these reasons, Bill,
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.100]   that's why you're seeing, you know,
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.620]   the market's taking, you know,
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.460]   just a bit more cautionary position.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.980]   And to be perfectly honest, it's not off the table.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:48.300]   This market could give up 100% of the gains
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.940]   that we've had year to date,
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.260]   which would mean you'd still have another,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:55.420]   you'd still have another 10 to 15% down in the market.
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.620]   And that just takes you back
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:57.980]   to where you were on January 1.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.340]   And so you have to ask yourself,
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.860]   as an investor sitting here in August,
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:06.540]   is the world so much better than it was on January 1, right?
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.540]   That it has to be priced 10 to 15% higher.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.580]   And the answer to that is no.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.260]   You know, I have a very similar thought
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.500]   on the whole Japan carry trade thing,
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.380]   which is, you know, at the end of the day,
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:22.100]   it really shouldn't matter for American investors, right?
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.580]   This was an arbitrage thing that had been created
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.580]   by a systematic, you know, problem in Japan
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.500]   that was started with stagflation,
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.620]   but where they had a problem.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.540]   I think the reason they had to raise rates
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:40.780]   is they had a problem that the currency was causing,
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.700]   and they felt like they had to defend it.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:46.180]   And, you know, the consequent was all these arbiters,
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:47.620]   you know, got wiped out.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.180]   But there's no sympathy line for arbiters, right?
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:54.460]   And even if the banks got in trouble
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:55.540]   and went to the government and said,
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.780]   "I need help because I had given loans to arbiters.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.940]   "They're not gonna make hold."
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.660]   There's not gonna be a long sympathy line for that either.
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.940]   And, but I do think what happened
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.780]   is exactly what you're saying,
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.580]   which is people were nervous already.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:15.340]   And so, like, you got your finger on the sell button,
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.280]   and then you wake up and you see this and said,
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.180]   "Shit, I should have sold last week."
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.020]   And you start pressing sell, right?
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.220]   Like, it becomes self-reinforcing,
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.940]   almost kind of like a reflexivity kind of thing.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.380]   That's my non-informed take on what happened there.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.660]   No, I mean, listen, when people are off sides,
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.140]   you know this hand in poker, right?
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:38.500]   Where you kind of limp in,
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.980]   maybe you have pocket sevens, right?
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:44.100]   And you got a little too much money at play,
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.460]   but you're feeling good.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.020]   You've been winning the whole night,
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:49.600]   and so you're feeling a little swagger.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.940]   That's kind of what a market is
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.820]   when it's at all-time highs, right?
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:55.280]   You're playing the hand a little too strong.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.140]   And then the flop comes and somebody has you trapped,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.400]   right, and now you're like, "Okay, I got this sunk cost.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.560]   "Do I take it off the table?
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.240]   "Do I, you know, do I bluff?
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.080]   "Do I bet bigger?"
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.780]   And, you know, I think this is one of these situations
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.180]   where people were just caught off sides, right?
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.460]   They viewed this as very, very easy money,
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.820]   and it's easy money until it's not.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.580]   And, you know, and so, you know,
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.140]   I put all of these things in the category
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.660]   of healthy, right, resets in the markets, right?
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:26.500]   I agree with that, I agree with that.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:30.060]   And so, you know, I do think there are a series of events,
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.420]   like if we end up in a recession,
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.900]   if one of these situations,
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.900]   if Japan, you know, were to trigger something bigger,
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.740]   if the geopolitical events caused
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.580]   the price of oil to spike, right,
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:47.560]   all of those risks have to be taken into account,
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.320]   you know, particularly when stocks
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.720]   are at or near all-time highs.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.060]   And that just means, again,
[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.920]   it doesn't mean you get out of the game, right?
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.180]   Like when prices are high in venture,
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.020]   you know, you don't just stop doing venture,
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.580]   right, but you do less,
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.260]   and you wait for the really great stuff.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.540]   And when prices are high in the public markets,
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.340]   you don't necessarily step out of the markets altogether,
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.340]   but you just do less.
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.860]   And that's how we think about it here.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.860]   It's less or more, how many units of risk
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.380]   do you wanna have on at any one moment in time?
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.940]   And I do agree that of the topics you mentioned,
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.100]   the one that matters the most is the recession one,
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.260]   going forward, so we'll see what happens.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.500]   Let's hit two more things before we wrap up.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.900]   The first thing we should dive into
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.660]   is this Google decision that happened this week,
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.140]   which is pretty landmark decision.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:42.140]   I think there've been pressure on a lot of the Mag 7,
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.860]   you know, from the government
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:46.140]   and questions about monopoly status.
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:51.140]   And, you know, having seen Google from, you know,
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:53.740]   I met with Sergey and Larry when there were 25 employees
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.700]   to today, I mean, kind of had a front row seat
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.180]   just to watch this amazing, you know,
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.060]   people have called it the best business model of all time.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:06.860]   What do you take away from this decision
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.660]   and what do you think it's gonna mean for going forward?
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.140]   Well, I kinda wanna turn the tables on you
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.620]   and ask you that given how close you've been to it
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.300]   and how much you've thought about this,
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.140]   but first just like, let's talk about
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:19.700]   what the ruling in fact did.
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:25.020]   So, you know, it said that Google used unfair tactics
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.420]   to maintain itself as the default search engine
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:30.300]   on the iPhone over the last decade.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.860]   And it said it did this mainly by negotiating
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:36.340]   lucrative deals worth over $25 billion per year
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:40.060]   to cement its position as the default search engine
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.060]   on the iPhone, which then led it to have superior data,
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.500]   which then led it to have superior conversion,
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.540]   which then led it to further cement its position.
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.300]   I think the current deal is set to run through 2026,
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.340]   but the court, I believe, has set September
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.700]   as a date to kind of work out a solution
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:03.780]   with Apple and Google that the judge
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.380]   will deem to comply with the ruling.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:10.460]   So I guess the question I have for you is,
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.340]   you know, these guys negotiated a deal
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.380]   between the two of them.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.740]   Google said, we'll pay you a bunch of money.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:19.460]   Like, what do you think is the remedy?
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:22.260]   What do you think is a better alternative?
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.300]   You know, why can't they do a deal with Google?
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.820]   So to your last question, you and I had forwarded
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.940]   back and forth Ben Thompson's thoughts on this,
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.780]   and obviously super intelligent human being,
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.420]   Ben, with a massive mental capacity.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:42.060]   And he wrote a piece, it's subscription,
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.800]   but we'll put a link to it.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.740]   Maybe we'll get him some new subs.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.500]   But he broke down the Sherman Act,
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:53.020]   which was what was the piece of regulatory law
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.420]   that was applied here.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.940]   And section one of the Sherman Act says,
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:00.300]   if you're a monopoly, and I don't think there's anyone
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.780]   that questions, you know, Google's monopoly status,
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:07.500]   just 'cause market share, you know, north of 80, 90%.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:11.020]   That's, and Ben makes a point of saying
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:12.500]   they earned it through innovation
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:16.220]   versus some type of underhanded tactic or a roll up.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.620]   And I think that's fair too.
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.300]   Like, but the Sherman Act doesn't say
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.860]   that there's a fair monopoly and an unfair monopoly.
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:24.740]   It just says, are you a monopoly?
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.980]   And then section two says, you can't enter
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:32.420]   into partnership deals, basically,
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.300]   that reinforce that monopoly position.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:40.300]   And so the judge, and Ben argues properly,
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:46.180]   looked at the Apple deal for the iPhone and said,
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:48.620]   you know, this violates section two.
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:51.580]   You're a monopoly and you're extending that monopoly
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.500]   with an exclusive deal.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:58.260]   And so one thing I would back up and highlight for people,
[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.500]   I think most people know this,
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:04.500]   but whatever the share is that Google's giving to Apple,
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:10.740]   let's say it's 30% or 40%, who knows, it might be 50.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.580]   You know, it represents this massive amount
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.980]   of net income for Apple, right?
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.940]   What's the number?
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:20.140]   - It's 26 billion, I think, a year or two ago.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:25.100]   - So the reality is that Google's monetization
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.860]   is so much better than anyone else that's out there
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:32.500]   that I don't think there's a deal you can do with Bing
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.620]   that will create that amount of net income for Apple.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.500]   So there's no, like, Apple's not mad about this deal.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.420]   They're very positively impacted by it.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:48.420]   And so that's a huge irony because they're not,
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.100]   it's not a loss leader for Google
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.500]   where they're blocking someone out.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.700]   It's a win-win for both parties
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.260]   because Google's so good at monetization on search
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.860]   that, like, I guess I'm making the argument
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.260]   if Bing gave them 100%,
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.100]   replacing them would cause Apple to have less money.
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.420]   - Oh, for sure, that's for sure the case.
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.340]   And what do you think the remedy is, Bill?
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.700]   I mean, is this just gonna end up in one of these,
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.700]   you know, and I saw a screenshot of this,
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.060]   these sloppy choices where, you know,
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.180]   the next time I open my iPhone, it says,
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.620]   "Choose what search engine you wanna use for this query."
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.420]   And it gives me a choice between Bing and DuckDuckGo
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.740]   and maybe now search GPT and maybe now Perplexity
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.500]   and maybe now Google, you know,
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.380]   is that gonna pop open every time?
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.700]   Do, you know, is it one and done?
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.700]   How do you think about that?
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.900]   And is that remedy enough?
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.740]   Like if the consumer chooses Google
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.420]   and Google just pays a rev share
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.620]   rather than, you know, boxing everybody out,
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.860]   do you think that remedy will be enough?
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.820]   - It could be, it could be a nothing burger.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.700]   So let's say that Apple is forced
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.140]   to do the selection chart.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:03.220]   Let's say Apple then tells every search engine
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.660]   in order to be a partner of us and in our search sort,
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.820]   we'll take 30% of whatever you earn.
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:14.900]   And then 90% of people choose Google.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.300]   I think you're in the same spot.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.060]   I think you end up in the same spot.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.580]   - That's why I think,
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.540]   that's why I think this is a bit silly.
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.380]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.260]   - If they're forced to do the search
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.060]   and Apple somehow cut out of the economics
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.380]   and then Google ends up making more money
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.780]   because I think the consumers
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.940]   are gonna choose 80 or 90% Google.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.740]   So yeah, I think there are remedies
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.620]   where it could be nothing.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.260]   One thing that would be super interesting,
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.260]   I think there, I've often said that the federal government
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.060]   should have a new test for a monopoly.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:52.180]   And this is a very self-centered bias
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.300]   to someone who's been a venture capitalist
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.180]   working with small companies for a long time.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:03:00.620]   But over the course of the years,
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:04.340]   there've been many cases where I've been fortunate enough
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.500]   to work with a category leader in a vertical or something
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:11.380]   and you get invited in by Google and Apple sometimes,
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:15.180]   sometimes at their request to do a deal
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:18.300]   and you're presented with a set of terms
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.540]   that you would never consider
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:23.020]   with any other party out there.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.020]   It's a completely one-sided deal.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.620]   And I've often thought that should be a test for a monopoly.
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.660]   Like, are they able to negotiate deals
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.940]   that are, that would just be off the table
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.860]   with any other set of partners?
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.780]   'Cause I do think it's a sign of strength.
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.340]   And I could even go further and say
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.100]   that it should qualify under the section two
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:53.100]   of the Sherman Act, because if the partnership deal
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.580]   results in the monopolist now having a new feature set
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.780]   because they were able to basically steal
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:02.780]   everything you've built through the terms of the deal,
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:07.580]   you've extended the monopoly through that practice.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.540]   So that was one thing, I'm sure Jeremy Stoppelman
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.180]   would agree with, but I just.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.260]   - That felt a little Yelp-like to me
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.700]   in terms of your concerns.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.740]   I wasn't gonna out you, but.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.500]   - No, not just Yelp though.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.460]   I mean, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.140]   - I mean, listen, I think it's a fine line, right?
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:30.380]   Michael Porter's five forces would make the argument
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.540]   that this is what businesses should try
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.460]   to achieve, which is enough market power
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.620]   that you can extract rents, commensurate
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.820]   with your market power.
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.820]   And so I don't think we wanna be casually
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:47.500]   undermining companies' ability to enter
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.260]   into commercial relationships, and those are gonna reflect
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.340]   different market power in the economy.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:56.220]   But to your point, listen, I think there's
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.340]   a pretty easy remedy here.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.620]   I think the remedy is gonna be consumer choice.
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:03.340]   I think the remedy is going to result
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:05.620]   in Google still getting 90% of the searches,
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.420]   but it may not, and the only reason it may not
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.180]   is because we are at this really disruptive moment
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.660]   with things like perplexity and search GPT.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.060]   And so, listen, I'm happy to let them compete
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.860]   and to see where it all shakes out.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:24.340]   And so speaking of, have you played with search GPT?
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.740]   - I have not, have you?
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.900]   - No, all I've seen are the screenshots,
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:34.760]   the videos, everything looks very perplexity-like to me.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:38.900]   - Well, look, I mean, just-- - Go ahead.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.020]   - I think it's worth stating.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.860]   I think a lot of people know this,
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.660]   but I talked to a few people yesterday that didn't.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.580]   I believe what happens at perplexity
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.860]   and why it's so much better when you're doing searches
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.460]   related to recent information,
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.020]   it's even good for the Olympics,
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.720]   I encourage people to use it,
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.620]   is that in the background,
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.100]   when you type a search into perplexity,
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:07.620]   they're doing a search against a Google-like database.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.260]   They're doing the equivalent of a Google search,
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.940]   maybe, I don't know where they built that,
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.380]   maybe they partner with DuckDuckGo or whatever,
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:18.300]   and they then take the results of that search
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:22.580]   and stuff it through RAG into the context window
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.380]   and make it part of the prompt.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:29.380]   And your result then is focused on those things,
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.840]   and so it can handle newness,
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:36.240]   which everyone knows the original AI models couldn't do
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.880]   because they weren't trained on it.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.960]   And that's also why a lot of people are like,
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.640]   "Surprise, perplexity has links."
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:44.760]   Well, the reason they have links
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.960]   is 'cause of the process I just described.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.120]   And so now, anyway, I think it's important
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.920]   for people to understand that now was,
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:54.700]   I think the difference between SearchGPT and ChatGPT
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.940]   is precisely that.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.620]   They're now doing that same thing.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.700]   Well, one of the things, a few weeks ago,
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:06.700]   you cast some doubt on the engagement metrics at OpenAI.
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.100]   I mentioned I was a little more bullish on OpenAI,
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.140]   but I wanted to do the work,
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:15.980]   so I had Apoorva on my team pull some metrics.
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.620]   And so I want to run through a few charts here
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:22.200]   about engagement and usage metrics
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.800]   that we're seeing on Gen AI apps
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.640]   compared to other consumer apps and enterprise apps,
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.600]   and get your reaction to this, Bill.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.880]   So this first chart here is just weekly average users,
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.640]   monthly average users.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.960]   And as you see, if you go to the far right on the chart,
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.160]   if you're like Spotify, Instagram, WhatsApp,
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:48.440]   they have engagement metrics well over 80%.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.960]   If you look at these generative AI apps,
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.320]   character tops out at about 64%.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.080]   But if you look at Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT,
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.340]   they're about 40%.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:03.340]   So much lower engagement than internet consumer apps.
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.280]   Now, if you go to the next slide-
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.700]   And by the way, just so people understand,
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:15.700]   you're looking at, I guess, is this MAU over WHA?
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:18.820]   Yes.
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:23.140]   Oh, it's WAU over MAU, so weekly versus monthly.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.660]   Okay, gotcha. Correct, correct.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:28.100]   Now, if you go to the next slide, which this is,
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:31.940]   what does it take to get to a really big app?
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:33.780]   And if you go to the far right,
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.100]   for those apps that have over 80% engagement,
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.460]   they get to billions of users.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.620]   But apps with much lower engagement,
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.940]   and this all stands to reason,
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:47.540]   those apps tend to cap out, right?
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:52.540]   At tens of millions, or maybe 100 million users, right?
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.900]   So the question we were debating is,
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:58.140]   can ChatGPT get to a billion users?
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:01.340]   And one of the early warning signs
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.340]   that you were talking about,
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.180]   this engagement doesn't look like
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:08.300]   it's the type of engagement that is commensurate
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.380]   with really growing your user base.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:14.460]   So then we asked the question around retention, right?
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.300]   Which is, I think,
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.420]   what you had specifically mentioned before.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.420]   So here's month one retention.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.460]   So this is one month retention.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.740]   Again, if you go to WhatsApp, Instagram,
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740]   Chrome, et cetera, right?
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:29.860]   Retention metrics, super high, over 90% retention.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.860]   And again, enterprise apps, like Gmail at 75%.
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:36.620]   But if you go to ChatGPT,
[01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:41.500]   it's the best of the Gen AI apps at about 65%.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.740]   But you see that these Gen AI apps
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.580]   also have not only lower engagement,
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.500]   but they have lower retention.
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:53.180]   Yeah, and you're mixing paid and unpaid on this.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:56.220]   So it's tricky, like you gotta be careful.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.500]   Duolingo's paid, Tinder's paid, Spotify's paid,
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.780]   WhatsApp X aren't paid.
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.860]   So anyway, that can be tricky.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:09.220]   I think what we're trying to drill down on is,
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.420]   and this should all stand to reason,
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:15.020]   but low engagement, lower retention,
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:19.180]   and lower usage as measured on this last chart
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:24.180]   by the minutes per week that these apps get used.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.900]   And what it tells me is this, Bill,
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.620]   and I just wanted to get your reaction to this.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:34.220]   I love ChatGPT, I love Perplexity,
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.820]   I love Claude, my team uses it all the time, right?
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.380]   It's a better version of search.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.980]   But the truth of the matter is,
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.940]   Google's copied them pretty quickly.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.580]   It hasn't led to massive share shift,
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.020]   and it hasn't led to a step function
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:52.860]   in engagement, retention, and usage.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.100]   And so I would say that SearchGPT,
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.100]   I don't think is going to be the product
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.020]   that gets up to a billion users.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.140]   And it reminds me, it takes me all the way back
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.260]   to a conversation you and I had maybe in episode four,
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:11.060]   which is what is going to be the next GPT moment.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:15.220]   And it feels to me like AI-enabled search
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.540]   is not that moment.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:21.140]   Maybe the moment is when we all have a personalized agent
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:23.900]   that has memory about us, that can track us over time,
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.660]   that really understands us, that can take actions.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:28.980]   We've talked about this on the pod.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.300]   But I think this data that we pulled together
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:34.660]   kind of confirms the point you made a few weeks ago,
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:38.340]   which is barring the launch of,
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.780]   I don't know whether it's Q* or some other product,
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.260]   that feels like it's really this personalized agent
[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:47.020]   that's 100X better in terms of driving
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.780]   my personal productivity.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.300]   I don't think we're seeing the metrics
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:56.420]   from ChatGPT and even SearchGPT
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.740]   that are going to lead to the breakout needed
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.820]   to get to that billion users.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.140]   By the way, this will sound a bit rude,
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.500]   but while you were talking, I did several search,
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.140]   GPT searches, and it's exactly like perplexity.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.300]   I think it's exactly what I described.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.860]   I had it drilled down on the Kristin Faulkner race.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.060]   I don't know if you got to see that.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.020]   It was fantastic.
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:17.860]   - Yes.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:20.180]   - The bike, this woman who apparently
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.140]   was briefly a venture capitalist,
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:25.620]   but the close she did was so brutal,
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.540]   like she accelerated when she caught him.
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.740]   Anyway, I just had to walk through all that.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.900]   It lists the sources.
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:32.940]   It's very similar.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.940]   I think there's some really big questions.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.260]   The $20 thing, is that real or not?
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.140]   Feels tough.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.460]   Like it feels tough.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.820]   It feels like Google's gonna do it for free.
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:47.540]   Feels like perplexity's kind of caved
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.740]   and said they got to do it for free.
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.700]   We'll see, I think.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.340]   But that's a big question because if you have
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.620]   to surround it with ads, it's a little different.
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.780]   And then the other key question,
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.300]   which we started talking about at the beginning
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:03.700]   of this podcast, is if it is free,
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:08.700]   is the alternative to Google in having less ad units
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.660]   on it just better?
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:16.660]   And so do you, even if Google can lay chase,
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.980]   is it a situation where the disruptor just doesn't make
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.140]   as much money and therefore that puts pressure
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:24.980]   on the incumbent?
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.980]   I still think that's a possibility.
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.900]   And I would pay the 20 not to have ads.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.860]   There's a lot of questions about how big
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.740]   that universe of people is.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:38.220]   I don't think it's the majority.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.180]   And so anyway, yeah, it's interesting to watch.
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.700]   The one thing I would add to your one month
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.300]   retention numbers, the numbers I had done,
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.540]   and I don't know if the service I'm using allows me
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.900]   to repost it, I'll have to ask them.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:54.740]   But they had 35% numbers for the 12 month retention,
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:59.740]   which is also pretty low and reinforces your point.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:02.900]   The other thing I would, last thing I would say
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.340]   about this is, you know, I continue, you know,
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.780]   when you start talking about that personal assistant,
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.020]   I continue to think, you know, I think Apple's
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:17.900]   in a decent position, but I really think that Google has,
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.860]   and it's interesting 'cause I just talked about
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:23.740]   how Google may be disrupted negatively by this on search.
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.620]   But when I think about the personal assistant side,
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.620]   having the assets of Gmail, Docs, Spreadsheets, and Android,
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:37.060]   you know, and I actually ran into Samir Samad who runs
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.820]   Android the other day and I had this discussion with him.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:43.400]   It's the best set of assets.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.100]   Like if you could pull it all together,
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:50.260]   it's the best set of assets because they have their hands
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.340]   on the mobile product, they have their hands on the email,
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.100]   they have their hands on, you know,
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.980]   your docs and infrastructure.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.260]   They have a product that competes with Slack and Teams.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:04.260]   So, you know, could I, I could imagine if they perfect
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:07.500]   that integration with AI and what I like to call
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.040]   infinite memory or infinite recollection,
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.500]   people switching to their stack and to their phone
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.140]   because it's done so well.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.780]   Like, and maybe I'm dreaming.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.820]   - One big problem, Bill, one big problem, Bill.
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.460]   It's called execution.
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.260]   And Google's been fumbling the ball
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.100]   and, you know, on getting there.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.660]   You know, they're going to be in the race.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:30.260]   You know, I would say when it comes to agents,
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.980]   the person who I think has talked most eloquently about it
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:36.100]   is doing a ton of work is Zuckerberg at Meta.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:38.040]   OpenAI is going to be in that race.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.180]   My main point here is not like,
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:43.080]   we know all of these are going to be in the hunt, right?
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.620]   They have the capabilities to be in the hunt.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.100]   Google may be advantaged from, you know,
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:51.040]   access to information and capabilities like you suggest.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:54.060]   But what's clear to me is that the current state
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.100]   of the consumer product,
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.140]   it's not enough to dislodge Google.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.300]   - And that could improve.
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:05.020]   I mean, the memory part could dramatically improve.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.060]   And I've said this many times,
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:09.020]   I think the voice thing's really cool.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:14.020]   I finally got the upgraded voice assistant on ChatGBT
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.980]   and I love playing with it.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:19.700]   It's just so much fun and I'm sure it'll get better,
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.060]   but it does everything.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.120]   I mean, you can just talk to it, you know,
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:28.120]   like you're sitting next to this incredible librarian.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.320]   And it's fun to do it with other people around.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.840]   People get a lot of kicks out of it.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:34.840]   So we'll see what happens.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.080]   I continue, so voice and memory are the two things
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.480]   that I think are the biggest and most exciting areas to add,
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.700]   but we'll see where it goes.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.280]   Let's touch on one last topic before we part ways.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:52.180]   We had yet another one of these odd transactions
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.220]   that I'm going, I wanted to brand it.
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.780]   So I'm going to throw out a phrase,
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.380]   a take under rather than a take over.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.340]   And so we've had inflection
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:05.020]   and the one that just happened is Character AI,
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:08.460]   which had pretty interesting engagement numbers
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.140]   on your slide here.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.460]   What's going on?
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.440]   I mean, like, what's your take on these transactions?
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.520]   There's now been enough of them that it's,
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.940]   I have to say it's a trend.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:27.600]   Well, I mean, I think it's a combination of two things.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.760]   Number one, I think from a company perspective,
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:34.700]   Noam Shazier is an incredible, you know,
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:38.840]   technologist, engineer, visionary, you know,
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.880]   was one of the authors on Attention Is All You Need.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.980]   And he's building, you know, he raised capital,
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.660]   building a great business.
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:48.560]   You saw the engagement metrics, they're off the charts.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:51.740]   But I imagine he's looking at the daunting amount
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.220]   of CapEx required, right?
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.900]   To continue to compete with Meta
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.260]   and continue to compete with Google.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:01.740]   And, you know, that's a challenging slog, Bill.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.540]   And so on the one hand, you have these founders
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.700]   who are saying, I need to have,
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:10.980]   I need to 10X my infrastack in order to go, you know,
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.780]   attract the best engineers to work on the best projects,
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:14.620]   et cetera.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:15.740]   And that's a full-time job.
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.780]   And I'm not even sure you can get it done.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.980]   On the other hand, Google and Microsoft and Meta,
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:25.380]   they're willing to pay super big money for talent,
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:26.980]   but they can't acquire companies
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.460]   because we know we have a regulatory environment
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.300]   in this country.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.420]   We're doing outright acquisitions as hard.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:36.320]   And so I think they've found this kind of third way
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.260]   that you describe.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.380]   I don't exactly know how it works, Bill,
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:41.060]   to be perfectly honest, I haven't been
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.460]   in either of these deals.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:47.080]   I would say that we looked at both inflection and character.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.420]   We really liked what we saw at character.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.260]   We wanted to be involved in it,
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.740]   but it was really hard to underwrite it
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.000]   for exactly this reason.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.880]   We said the most likely outcome
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:00.300]   is that they're gonna be a seller to Google or to Meta
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.220]   because it's gonna be very hard to break out.
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.720]   Now, they're doing these deals.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.820]   If it was just an outright sale of the business
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.620]   and you sold the business for 3X
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:13.060]   what the series A investors put into the business,
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.920]   I don't even think we'd be talking about this.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.140]   We would say, it was a reasonable outcome
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.860]   and they're going on and gonna build something bigger
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:22.380]   and better at Google.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.100]   I think what's interesting here
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.160]   is that these things are being structured,
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.060]   not as a straight up M&A in order to avoid perhaps
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.020]   some of the regulatory scrutiny.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:34.140]   And so, I don't know, I ask you,
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.820]   I'm just not sure how they're structured or how they work,
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:42.700]   but the rumors, at least as reported by the information
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.380]   and some other places is that investors are earning
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.660]   two or 3X on their money in character.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.260]   I'm just not sure exactly how it's structured.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.560]   So, I'm not 100% sure either,
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.900]   and I've done quite a bit of research knocking on doors.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:01.840]   And I also am not in one of those companies
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.700]   and so I don't have perfect information.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:07.100]   And if anyone does, if anyone wants to reach out
[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:09.420]   and chat with me about it and explain to me how it works,
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.260]   I'd love to hear it.
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:13.400]   But I did talk to a few attorneys
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.500]   that have been around the Valley for a long time.
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.900]   And I would state this,
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:21.100]   one, it is almost certainly the case that this,
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.800]   the primary reason that these funky transactions
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.300]   are happening or let's just call them non-standard
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:33.460]   is precisely to avoid federal regulatory scrutiny.
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:38.820]   And so, the minute that the Fed,
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:41.740]   the people in the Fed realize that's what's happening,
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.080]   they can start a process of laying chase,
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.420]   which might involve lawsuits,
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:47.780]   might involve pushing on Congress
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:50.420]   to write rules in a different way,
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:52.300]   but they can't stop it right away.
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:53.460]   And so, you're gonna,
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.340]   you'll probably continue to see this happen.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.300]   It is, if it is an ARB,
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:01.600]   the people that wrote the original rules won't be happy.
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:05.860]   Let's just state that, like there's no reason they should.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.300]   Two, as I understand it,
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:12.040]   there is a substantial double taxation risk.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.820]   And if this is not the case,
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:17.020]   it's a thing I'd love for someone to educate me on.
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:22.020]   But the way the money makes it from the MagSeven
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:26.500]   to the investors, I think is two-step.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:30.340]   One, the money is transferred to the startup
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:33.500]   as part of this massive license deal.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:37.060]   And that's revenue for the company,
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:40.740]   which is exposed to corporate tax at that level.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:44.540]   And then step two is either a stock buyback
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:48.460]   or a dividend distribution to the shareholders.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:50.220]   And that two-step process,
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.180]   and then obviously that's taxable at a personal level.
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:58.180]   And so, that is, it seems like a sticky piece of this.
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.540]   And it means if someone truly is getting 2X
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:03.780]   back on their money,
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:08.940]   they'd have to, the MagSeven would be paying 3X
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:12.540]   or whatever, so that the taxes, you know--
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:15.780]   So it could net out that, yeah, net out the 2X.
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.940]   And I could, I mean, I'd love to hear how I'm wrong,
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:21.540]   or I'd love to actually have perfect visibility
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.300]   into how one of these things plays out.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:28.300]   I continue to doubt that it's preferable
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:32.780]   for the venture investor to a traditional deal.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.220]   It just seems a little too sloppy and messy,
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:39.020]   and this entity stays around.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.100]   And people, it's funny, in all these PR releases,
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.500]   they try and posture as if this thing's gonna achieve
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:49.220]   great stuff after all the core people left.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:52.340]   And that act of theater alone causes me
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.140]   to be a little skeptical of what's going on.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:57.220]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:00.100]   I'd be surprised if this is the case with Character.
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.180]   I think they had options.
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.260]   I think they had other buyers of the business.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.580]   So I'd be surprised if it didn't work out in a way
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.820]   that was reasonably positive for the investors
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.620]   and reasonably positive for the team.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:13.340]   You know, frankly, I think it was a bit of a coup for Google
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:15.180]   to get Noam and his team back there.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.500]   I mean-- No doubt about that.
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.700]   You saw these engagement metrics.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.140]   They really are building.
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.980]   They have an eye to build something here
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.140]   that I think is important.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:27.580]   So I, like you, I look forward to learning more about this.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:28.740]   But, you know, it also--
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.780]   And if they fix Character and the things that I've read
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.860]   in the user forums and on Reddit
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:38.780]   is that it doesn't evolve with you.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.780]   So it goes back to this memory issue
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.700]   and this kind of infinite recollection.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.860]   But if they fix that, you know, this is a product
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.780]   that feels more at home at Meta than it does at Google.
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:52.860]   So it'd be a new front for Google, I think,
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:55.780]   if they were to make this work.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:24:00.020]   You know, I would say, finally, Silicon Valley
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:01.220]   has been battling it out.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:05.500]   We talked about it on the last episode.
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.540]   You know, Washington Post talks about,
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.820]   why is Silicon Valley all in the Trump category?
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:15.460]   Now we have VCs for Kamala, you know, and a long list there.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.580]   You know, this seems to be the one thing
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.060]   that both sides in Silicon Valley
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:21.580]   agree on, Bill, which is, you know,
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:25.780]   LenaCon and the regulatory environment
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:29.060]   that has been created that causes, you know,
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:32.020]   these companies to have to do these legal gymnastics
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:34.660]   in order to do acquisitions of small teams
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:35.540]   and small companies.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:39.340]   It just seems that it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:42.580]   Part of the beauty of capitalism is creative destruction.
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:43.660]   Companies come and go.
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:44.980]   Companies get acquired.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.420]   Teams move around.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.580]   That's part of the dynamism of it all.
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:53.300]   So whoever is in this new administration,
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:58.140]   you know, I certainly hope that we enter into a new period
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:59.780]   where, you know, they're enforcing
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:02.980]   the stuff that's on the books, where monopolists are truly
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.900]   blocking out smaller competitors using their monopoly power.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.580]   But we need to get back to a place
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:13.460]   where, you know, Microsoft and Google can go buy,
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:17.620]   you know, a company that's de minimis relative to their size.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.500]   You know, Amazon can buy a vacuum cleaner company,
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:24.260]   you know, iRobot, without, you know,
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.500]   phalanxes of lawyers and having to come up
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.660]   with these creative structures.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:31.380]   I can't see how this is in any way good for the country.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:32.460]   - Yeah, understood.
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.300]   All right, sir.
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.140]   - All right, buddy.
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:34.980]   Great seeing you.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.820]   - Thank you very much.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:36.660]   Take care.
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:37.500]   - Yeah, we'll talk soon.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:38.340]   Bye-bye. - Bye.
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:50.080]   As a reminder to everybody, just our opinions,
