[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.060]   Welcome to this special weekend edition
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.320]   of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.360]   In the last week or so, we have gotten about 50 emails
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.960]   from listeners who wanna hear from you, Pastor John,
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.120]   about Kim Davis, a county clerk in the state of Kentucky.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.800]   Here's one such email from Sherry,
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.480]   one of our faithful podcast listeners,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480]   who simply asks this.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.000]   Pastor John, is Kim Davis wrong
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.320]   for not signing same-sex marriage licenses?
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.680]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.960]   I don't know Kim Davis's heart,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.520]   and so I can't assess her motives,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.820]   and I don't know her theology.
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.400]   It's possible to do right actions for wrong reasons,
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.620]   and so be wrong in doing right.
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.280]   So I'll just try to say something about her actions
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.560]   and what appear to be some of her convictions,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.120]   and perhaps touch on some wider implications.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.200]   So first, I think she's right
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.000]   in rejecting so-called same-sex marriage
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.840]   as contrary to God's design for what marriage is,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.560]   and she is right in assessing this departure
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.640]   from God's will as massive, not marginal,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.640]   and as personally and culturally deadly, not trivial.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.240]   And therefore, not something
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.200]   that you can just go along with
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.520]   as if that were a loving thing to do.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.760]   The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 6, 9, and 10
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.800]   that the endorsement of same-sex practice,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.320]   which is what the approval
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.920]   of so-called same-sex marriage does,
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.240]   that that endorsement of that practice,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.200]   along with idolatry, greed, theft, drunkenness,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.040]   is an endorsement of the destruction of persons.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.640]   Those who impenitently practice such things
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.120]   Calling such behaviors legal in no way
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   removes the capital punishment that will follow in eternity.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.680]   Therefore, this judgment of the Supreme Court
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.680]   is massively evil and deadly for persons.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.600]   Kim Davis is right if she believes that.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.920]   Seems she does.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.000]   Second, I think she's morally right
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.320]   and probably legally right to refuse
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.160]   to put her name on the marriage license
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.380]   of two men or two women.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.720]   She's morally right because God has given civil authority
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.880]   and civil authorities to the world
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.480]   to reward the right and punish the evil.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.200]   So when those authorities, instead of doing that,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.360]   promote evil and punish good,
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.320]   those authorities may rightly be disobeyed
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.120]   for the sake of obeying God.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.000]   So here are the two key texts.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.640]   1 Peter 2, 13.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.120]   Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.880]   whether it be to the emperor supreme or to governors
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   as sent by him to punish those who do evil
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.160]   and to praise those who do good.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.160]   So be subject to governors as they're sent
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.360]   to punish evil and do good.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.600]   Paul said it like this, Romans 13, 1.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.320]   "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities,
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.080]   "for there is no authority except from God,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.440]   "for," here's the ground,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.440]   "rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.240]   "He is God's servant for your good."
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.240]   Now, I don't think Peter and Paul are naive
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.280]   in writing this way.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.000]   I think what they mean when they tell us
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.320]   that this is the way it is,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.080]   this is what governments do,
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.520]   they reward the good, they punish the evil,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.400]   that what they mean is that this is what governments
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.000]   ought to do.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.920]   This is the way it ought to be.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.100]   For example, when Paul says,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.100]   "Rulers are not a terror to good conduct,"
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.880]   we're liable to scratch our heads
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.200]   to think of a hundred cases where governments
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.120]   have slaughtered people in great wickedness.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.640]   And so what in the world, Paul?
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   Well, Paul says rulers are not a terror to good conduct.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.800]   Like a dad says to his children,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.600]   "We tell the truth in this family."
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.200]   That's the indicative statement of what ought to be.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.000]   "We treat other with kindness in this family."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.200]   That's what we do.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.660]   He doesn't mean sin never happens in this family.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.760]   The kids are not always good.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.160]   He means this is what we ought to do.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.960]   And when we don't act this way,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.280]   we're acting out of character.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.600]   It ought not to be.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.400]   Something should change.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.320]   And so it is with governments.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   They exist to support the good and resist the bad.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.200]   And here's an interesting thing.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.000]   A few verses later in Peter 2.18,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.200]   he gives an illustration of how slaves
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.920]   are to be subject to masters.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.260]   So he's carrying this submission theme through
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.360]   for governments and slaves and wives and husbands
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.160]   and children and so on.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   And then he says, "Servants, be subject to your masters,
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.160]   "even to the unjust, for what credit is it
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.240]   "if when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure?
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   "But if when you do good, when you do good
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.060]   "and suffer for it, you endure,
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.560]   "this is a gracious thing in the sight of God."
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   So Peter envisions someone under authority
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.460]   doing something good that gets him a beating.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.840]   Authorities don't ordinarily punish people
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.320]   for being completely compliant.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   Now, of course, it may be that the slave was slandered
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.640]   and then punished for something he did not do.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.400]   That's possible, but that's not what the text says.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.000]   He wouldn't jump to that conclusion, I don't think,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.040]   without pressing it.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.640]   And it seems to me that he has done something good.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.240]   Maybe he stuck up for a fellow Christian slave
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.840]   or maybe he shared the gospel or maybe he or she, say,
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.640]   refused to have sex with the master.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.400]   When you do good and suffer and endure,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.120]   this is a gracious thing with God.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   So it may well be, I suspect it is,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.920]   that this slave or citizen or wife or whatever
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   knew he or she would pay a price.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.680]   And that was a gracious thing with God,
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.400]   to suffer like that for doing good.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.320]   Now, I think Kim Davis was right
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.120]   not to sign the marriage licenses
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.720]   and thus to treat evil as marriage.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.840]   It's not marriage.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.960]   And to participate in the endorsement
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.920]   of anyone's destruction, which is what she's doing
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.800]   if she blesses with her authority and her signature,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   this union which leads to destruction.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.840]   Encouraging homosexual behavior
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.520]   is the participation in someone's destruction.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.320]   I think she's right not to do that.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.320]   Now, I said she may be also legally right
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.640]   and not just morally right.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.800]   Now, this is complicated, but just a few observations.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.520]   Was she legally bound to resign
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.920]   instead of obstructing the licensing process?
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.940]   Now, there are two angles on this,
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.240]   two ways to come at this.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.320]   One is to observe that perhaps
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.280]   she's not the one breaking the law,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.900]   but that the Supreme Court broke the law
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.320]   by the ludicrous claim that they could find
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.640]   in the Constitution a right to the nonexistent illusion
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.040]   called same-sex marriage.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.780]   That's absolutely ludicrous
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.640]   that they could find such a thing in the Constitution.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.520]   They came up with that out of thin air
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   because they want it to be.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.260]   There does come a point, doesn't there?
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.300]   I mean, I have to ask everybody,
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.780]   doesn't there come a point where people with eyes say,
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.020]   "This strutting court has no clothes on."
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.780]   They may have a tiny little,
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.740]   a picture, maybe an inch across,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.360]   a tiny tyrannical crown on their heads,
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.340]   but they are not robed with the royal power
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.700]   to make the Constitution condone the killing of children
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.740]   and so-called same-sex marriage.
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.980]   It cannot be done.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.500]   They have created out of nothing this mirage.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.480]   The other angle that suggests Kim Davis
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.300]   was not only morally right, but perhaps legally right,
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.300]   is that she was drawing the line, the hill to die on,
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.900]   not at whether so-called gay marriage
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.780]   could be authorized by anyone in Kentucky,
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.980]   but by whether it would have to be authorized by her.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.220]   The specific issue was whether her name
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.220]   or her official authority as clerk was put on the licenses.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:04.400]   And so the legal question is, does an employee,
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.020]   even an elected employee,
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.020]   have to comply with every aspect of the job description
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.580]   if it compromises the conscience
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.260]   or are there legal, legal, that's the key word here,
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.780]   the legal provisions that mandate
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.860]   that an employer adjust the employee's job requirements
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.240]   to avoid the conflict with conscience?
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.720]   And the answer is yes.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.820]   Both the Federal Civil Rights Act
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.020]   and Kentucky's Religious Freedom Restoration Act
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.900]   have such provisions in them.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.500]   And so the question for the court,
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.180]   if she pursues it this way,
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.940]   I don't know how she's pursuing it,
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.780]   is whether the adjustment in her job description
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.380]   can be made without an undue burden on that office,
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.380]   on the employer.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.140]   Kim Davis's case is not unique.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.540]   People need to really be aware of this.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:04.260]   Can she keep her job and not do part of her job
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.580]   because of her conscience?
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.300]   Like, and these are all real litigations,
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.260]   nurses who have religious objections,
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.340]   not to being a nurse, but to doing abortions,
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.780]   can they keep their job and not do abortions?
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.340]   Even though the hospital says you have to, that's your job.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.600]   Can a Muslim truck driver not transport alcohol?
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.820]   Can a pacifist postal worker
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.540]   not process draft registration forms?
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.380]   Can a Jehovah's Witness employee
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.200]   not be required to raise the flag at the school?
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.600]   Can a vegetarian bus driver
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.280]   not be required to hand out hamburger coupons?
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.820]   I mean, those are all real cases I read
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.180]   about whether or not legally
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.780]   one can have his job description without resigning,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.900]   adjusted so as to avoid the conflict with conscience.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.000]   So for Kim Davis, the legal question is,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.980]   can she be given an exemption
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.540]   so that she can carry out her clerk's duties
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.820]   while not giving any of her official authority
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.880]   to the licensing of so-called same-sex marriage?
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.140]   And the answer is, we'll see.
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.180]   I don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:13.180]   But morally, she is, of course, just one prominent case
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.500]   of what will be hundreds in the months and years to come
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.820]   as Christians and others draw a line of conscience
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.720]   beyond which they will not go.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.220]   And the upshot for us, all of us,
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.580]   is that we should all be pondering now
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.880]   what that line is in our vocation, our schooling,
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.300]   our civic life, our finances, our friendships,
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.300]   because if we're not fixed and strong in our resolve
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.820]   and are taken off guard with the threat of loss,
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.780]   we will cave in.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.400]   Now, now is the time to be clear and resolve
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.260]   before they knock on your door.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.460]   - Wonderful, Pastor John.
