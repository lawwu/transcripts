[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.680]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.840]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.040]   My guest today is Rod Khalif.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.080]   Rod is a long time, what do you call yourself, Rod, a real estate investor?
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840]   How do you introduce yourself to the cocktail party?
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.080]   I wear a lot of hats.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.400]   I've been in real estate my entire life, but I've also owned about 18 businesses, but real
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.400]   estate is my love.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.800]   Well, this will be interesting because sometimes when people say, "I've owned many businesses,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.680]   that could be a great thing," sometimes that can be a bad thing.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.480]   Oh, no, I can tell both stories.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.080]   I've had spectacular successes, but equally spectacular failures.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.480]   So that means you've been involved in business then, huh?
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   Yes, I have.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.640]   We call them seminars, though.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   We don't call them failures.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640]   We call them seminars.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.640]   I like that.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640]   That's good.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.320]   So, I mean, to start at the beginning, what was your path into the business and real estate
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320]   world?
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.400]   Well, I immigrated when I was six from Holland, and my mom and I and my brother immigrated
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.040]   on a boat and ended up in Denver.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.400]   And we grew up...
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.800]   Why did you guys come over here?
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:23.240]   Well, my mom and dad had gotten a divorce, and she had met a guy through mail correspondence
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.200]   that his wife had died.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.980]   And so my mom had two sons.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.280]   He had two sons, and he lived in Denver, and he needed a housekeeper.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.040]   So he agreed to allow her with us to come and live in his home.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.000]   They ended up getting married and having a son.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.320]   So it was yours, mine, and ours, five boys in this house.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.920]   But we didn't have much.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.760]   It was a very, I won't say poverty, but it was low on the economic scale.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760]   We had to...
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.360]   I remember my clothes came from the Goodwill.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.900]   We had powdered milk instead of regular milk because it was cheaper.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.200]   We had day-old bread.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.080]   And I don't have any regrets about that because I really believe that's where I got my drive
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.200]   from.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.520]   But I got into real estate when I turned 18.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.400]   I went out and I got my broker's license, which you were able to do then in Colorado
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.520]   without experience.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.880]   You could go directly to broker.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.080]   And typically, you go from an agent to a broker.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.120]   But I made the paper because I just turned 18.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.720]   I got my broker's license, made my mom proud.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.520]   And I got into real estate.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.680]   And I started buying and selling real estate.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.080]   Didn't really make very much money.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.600]   I'm sorry, I started helping other people.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.420]   I acted as a broker in real estate my first couple of years and didn't make very much
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.420]   money.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.420]   And then I started buying.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.000]   And I ended up buying about 500 houses in Denver as a buy and hold strategy.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.160]   And then I went to Memphis, bought a couple of hundred houses there.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.720]   And this is a decade we're talking about now, this period of time.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.320]   And then ended up in Florida, where I've been for 16 years.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   I love it.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.120]   I've bought between 1,300 and 1,400 houses here in Denver.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   And by the way, I would not recommend...
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   Denver or Florida?
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Florida, Florida, Florida, Florida, Florida.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   Sorry.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.840]   By the way, I would not recommend what I've done to anybody.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.440]   And when 2008 hit, I had one of those seminars I was talking about, and it was the biggest
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440]   one ever.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.640]   It was a huge one and got my butt handed to me.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.320]   And what was interesting is my houses didn't do great, but I had multifamily properties
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   at the time as well.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.480]   So, you know, I've had a couple thousand houses in my career, but I've also had numerous multifamily
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.680]   apartment buildings.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.400]   And those did just fine through the contraction in '08, the crash.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.160]   And so, you know, my big...
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.880]   What I enjoy talking about now is multifamily real estate because I really believe that's
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   the ticket.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.160]   I know a lot of people have made a lot of money in houses.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.480]   I've made a lot of money in houses, but, you know, here in Florida particularly because
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.560]   the taxes and insurance are high and the caliber of houses that I was buying were kind of the
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   low end.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.720]   So there was a lot of turnover.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.400]   I had to sell a house occasionally or refinance a house occasionally to make it.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.900]   And I'd refinanced a few too many.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.320]   And so when '08 happened, yeah, I got my clock cleaned and...
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.400]   But it's all good, you know.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.800]   I learned the lesson.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.040]   I got the memo.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.160]   And now my focus is multifamily investing.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.920]   Love talking about that.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:32.240]   In hindsight, what have you changed in your thinking and your strategy since 2008 based
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.560]   upon your lessons?
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.600]   Yeah, well, I'm a lot more cautious.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.960]   I won't say to a fault, but I'm much more conservative than I was then.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   And you know...
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   How so?
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   How is that being expressed?
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.400]   Well, you know, we've looked at...
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.480]   We look at a whole lot of properties before we pull the trigger.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   Now again, we're at the...
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.440]   You know, fairly high in a cycle right now.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.160]   We're at the crest of the wave where, you know, I feel like there's a contraction coming.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160]   In fact, you know, as you know, I have a podcast and I interview people as well.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.960]   And I interviewed a guy that was a billionaire and he has 35,000 apartment units.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.640]   And he said, "Hey, there's a contraction coming in the next like 24 months.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.620]   It's not going to be as bad as '08, but it's going to be a pullback."
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.060]   And then I interviewed somebody else that has a few hundred million dollars with the
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.640]   real estate, said the exact same thing.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.600]   And when people of that magnitude say these things, you start listening.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.960]   And you know, I've been through three of these cycles already.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.100]   Nothing like '08 though.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.040]   So I'm going in with both eyes wide open, Josh.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.920]   I counsel people that flip houses and I tell them, "Listen, if you're going to flip houses,
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.280]   that's great.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.720]   It's a great way to make money.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.020]   But I would not be doing higher end houses right now because you should have a second
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.640]   exit strategy just in case the market contracts.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.440]   Because when it does, financing will dry up and you won't be able to sell.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.840]   So you better be able to rent or have another exit strategy."
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.660]   So it's things like that.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.960]   It's things like, you know, when I'm looking at a multifamily complex, I want to look at
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.360]   the worst case, you know, what happens.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.200]   And I want to be able to tell my investors this.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   And I do.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.360]   And that, you know, if the market contracts and cap rates, which is how commercial property
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.820]   and multifamily property is measured, it's a multiple of the net operating income.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.300]   It's called a capitalization rate.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.040]   If cap rates go up, then values go down.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.000]   And it's possible in this upcoming contraction that cap rates could go up a little bit.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.880]   And if that happens and you buy a multifamily property with the idea that you can refinance
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.600]   it or sell it in four or five years, again, you better either have a second exit strategy
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.160]   or make sure that you plan a little more long term in case this contraction that everybody
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.560]   talks about comes to fruition, which, you know, I kind of believe it will after the
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560]   election.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.440]   So it's things like that.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.520]   It's looking at the exit strategies, looking at having a little longer measuring tape as
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.440]   it relates to your liquidity event after you've purchased a property.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.240]   So I'm getting a little detailed here, but I really don't know how to how else to answer
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   your question.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.920]   I mean, that you know how I look, you know, these are the things I'm thinking about and
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.240]   looking at.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.560]   Detailed meat is exactly what the Radical Personal Finance audience is looking for.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   We're meat eaters.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   We're not fluff eaters.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.800]   So, yeah, so so that's what I you know, I look at, you know, I have a little longer
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   window in my in my analysis of properties because, you know, I want to I want to be
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.760]   OK and have my investors be OK if you know that or when that contraction happens, if
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.980]   we can't liquidate right away.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.320]   So, you know, I want to make sure the debt is long enough.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.560]   Like I wouldn't want to do a five year balloon right now.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.360]   I'd want to do a seven to 10 year balloon, ideally 10 years just to just to, you know,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.360]   be safer.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.520]   And I wouldn't have been that careful.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.120]   And I wasn't that careful prior to 08.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.240]   But you know, when you have a big seminar like that, you learn.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   That's.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.040]   I want to ask a question, and this is a sincere question.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.000]   It's not it's not meant as a as a means of entrapment.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's a sincere question.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Here's the question.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.440]   When you talk about, you know, having owned all these hundreds and I mean, your website
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.320]   says over 2000 apartments and homes.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.960]   The scale of that number to me is a little bit mind boggling.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.480]   What is the word you're looking for?
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.760]   Well, I mean, that's a recipe for pain.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.160]   I guess I think about it and I have pain, you know.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.920]   Listen, listen, my my forte is systems.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.520]   OK, I'm good at systems.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.080]   And I was able to buy these houses.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.460]   I mean, I didn't buy bulk packages of houses.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.880]   These are one off one at a time.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.720]   I was going to ask that one at a time.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.560]   I bought 2000 houses.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.640]   And, you know, I got lucky in Denver.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.720]   I mean, you know, people say you luck combined with action, you know, is really is really
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.800]   how to be a success.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.040]   But I did take action.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.480]   But I was in the right place at the right time there because the market had just crashed.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.460]   I got in and everybody was hurting and they were giving they were selling houses to investors
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.680]   for 500 down.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.200]   And then it went to 5 percent down.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.440]   And I had a real estate license, a broker's license.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.560]   So I got a 6 percent commission whenever I sold or bought a house.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.560]   So do the math.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.600]   I was getting houses with nothing down basically.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.480]   And and I, you know, I got a lot of partners involved.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.920]   You know, if your listeners are interested in getting into the real estate space, you've
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.520]   got to educate yourself because you've got to have confidence because that confidence
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.960]   will give you the ability to influence.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.400]   And and you need that ability if you're going to bring partners into deals and and and and
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.800]   you've got to have the knowledge so that that you don't you know, you don't damage your
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.320]   partners that you do it right.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.680]   And I brought in partners in in in Denver and bought a lot of houses that way, ended
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   up buying most of them out.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.520]   But but, you know, I bought them one at a time and renovated them and rented them out.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.120]   And again, it's systems.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.360]   And again, I wouldn't wish that on anybody.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.440]   And that's why I say if you're interested in getting into real estate investing, really
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.920]   think about multifamily.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.600]   It's so much easier for a whole bunch of reasons.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.880]   So so we'll go to multifamily in just a second.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.240]   But that's I guess that's the question I was driving at when I do this this show.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.200]   Part of it is for my audience and part of it is for me.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.000]   I kind of think that if I indulge my curiosity and ask you the questions that I'm interested
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.320]   in, then the audience will benefit.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.960]   And so as a young man, I'm 31 years old.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.560]   And as I think about my own personal real estate investment strategies, I've only I've
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.480]   never owned an invest a real estate investment property with the goal of investment yet.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:51.240]   And I've been studying my local market and partly studying it and partly waiting on a
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.640]   couple of things in my personal life and partly waiting on changes in the market cycle.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.280]   But as I look at it, it's just so mind boggling the high volume.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.040]   And I think, OK, I buy a good house a year.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.960]   John Shobb strategy of buy a three, two.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.080]   That strategy has just really resonated with me.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.520]   And so I think, OK, I'll just buy a house a year.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.880]   Maybe then after a few years, maybe a couple of houses and you wind up, depending on the
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.480]   number over the course of a couple of decades, you wind up with a portfolio of houses that
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.560]   you like and it's enough money.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.720]   And then you can maybe do some partner deals on the side and it seems relatively low stress.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.960]   2000 houses just sounds crazy stressful.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   Did you make money that it was worth it?
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.240]   Oh, no, I made a ton of money.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.880]   I mean, I built a 10 million dollar testament to my ego on the beach here in Florida.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.200]   You know, the Lamborghini, you know, I did.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.640]   I mean, I had big goals.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.080]   I had big dreams.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.020]   And and my life has changed.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.520]   And what drives me now, you know, like I just did.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.120]   I was mentioning to you before we started on the air here, I just did a goal setting
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.120]   workshop.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.360]   And so this is kind of fresh in my mind.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.400]   And I showed pictures of these things that I've that I've acquired over the years from
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.200]   that house on the beach to, you know, my present compound on the on the water to, you know,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.560]   these cars that I thought were important, the Rolls Royce, the Lamborghini, these things
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.960]   that I thought were important, which I don't any longer.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.840]   But but, you know, I wanted to prove something, because, again, from my upbringing, I came
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.560]   from from very little and I had something to prove, I think, you know, and and and so
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.100]   I wanted to do it bigger.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.680]   And it was just to me, it was easy.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.680]   The systems were easy.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.500]   And it was like, why isn't everybody doing this?
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.400]   You can buy these houses for, you know, 30, 40 grand fully financed.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.740]   I can rent them in cash flow.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.080]   And I'm like, why isn't it the reason everybody wasn't doing this because they just had their
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.900]   butt kicked, you know, in the in the crash prior to when I was buying in Denver.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:49.620]   But, you know, I guess I've just always tried to think a little bigger.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.420]   And and like I said, I want to look great.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.980]   Yeah, I want to look crazy with the houses.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.740]   I wish that I had done it with multifamily because I wouldn't have gotten my clock cleaned
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.740]   in a wait.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.500]   But, you know, hindsight's 20/20 and and it's OK because, you know, things are going well
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.500]   now.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:11.980]   But, you know, I think it's those goals that that, you know, people have and yours, you
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.700]   know, your your your your your your way of the way you just described how you would do
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.700]   it, a house at a time.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.700]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.060]   In fact, it's fantastic.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.580]   I would just give it a caveat.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.540]   I would just say instead of a house, do a duplex, do a fourplex.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.540]   Sell me on multifamily.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.340]   And let's switch to there.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.300]   Why should I pursue multifamily housing instead of single family housing?
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.980]   Well, I guess put a picture of my my face on the wall, my ugly face on the wall, because
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.660]   I had the houses.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.660]   OK.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:47.180]   And and, you know, the thing with a house is if if it's empty, you're 100 percent vacant.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.180]   OK.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.020]   And if you've got a mortgage on that house, you're going to be paying that mortgage.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.580]   Now if you have a duplex or a fourplex and you've got a unit empty, you may very well
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.040]   still be breaking even.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:04.420]   So, you know, if you're thinking houses, see what's in your market for duplexes and triplexes
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.180]   and quads, because not only are they safer, they're they're they're going to be better
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.840]   to survive a contraction.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.820]   People need a place to live.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:19.100]   You know, right now, in my opinion, real estate is about cash flow.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.540]   You shouldn't even be looking at value.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.740]   You should be totally focused on cash flow.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.060]   And this is again is from my seminar.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.100]   Had I paid more attention to cash flow, I would have survived the crash.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.000]   But, you know, I was I was you know, I had a big ego because in 2006, my net worth went
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.440]   up 17 million dollars.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.780]   OK, that's just by sleeping.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.800]   My net worth went up 17 million bucks in '06, but that was '06.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   OK.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.860]   And I you know, it went down a whole lot more than that in '08.
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.800]   But had I focused on cash flow instead of value, you know, I'd be on the back of my
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.020]   yacht right now, frankly.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.040]   So, you know, that's I like multifamily because it's safer.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.040]   It's easier to manage.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   OK.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.900]   I mean, you can imagine I had 800 houses here in Florida when it crashed.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.240]   I had houses two hours north of Sarasota and two hours south of Sarasota and everywhere
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.240]   in between.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.760]   Just the logistics of leasing an empty property, the logistics of handling a maintenance call.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.000]   But even let's do it on a smaller scale.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.240]   Let's say you've got five to ten houses and they're spread throughout town.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.320]   You send a maintenance guy out there, you know, he's got to go see what it see, what
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   it needs.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.520]   Chances are the mechanical in each one of the houses is going to be different.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.620]   The appliances are going to be different.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.560]   So from a maintenance standpoint, much harder to manage from a leasing standpoint versus
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.980]   like a 10 unit.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.700]   So you know, or a five unit or a four unit.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.080]   It's just easier to manage.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.480]   It's easier to lease.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.040]   It's it's you know, it's it's going to it's going to be contraction.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.200]   I won't say proof, but much safer if for when a contraction happens because of what I said
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.520]   about vacancies.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.900]   And you know, frankly, they're going to go up in value as much or more than a single
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.000]   family house.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.360]   So you know, honestly, buying a duplex or a quad is just as much work as buying a house.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.420]   I mean, it's the same amount of work to buy a house as it is to buy a plex.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.640]   If you're thinking, you know, that size.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.960]   And frankly, buying a 10 unit is as easy as buying a fourplex.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.240]   So you know, why not?
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.440]   That's my answer to your question.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.560]   Why not?
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.360]   So you live there in Sarasota.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.760]   So I mentioned John Schaub.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.240]   Yeah, that's where he's from.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.560]   I really connected with his, I guess, just with this, the simplicity of his books and
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.720]   his approach.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.320]   So he takes those things on and here and I'd love to hear your rebuttals because this is
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.240]   what real estate people do is argue with one another left and right.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.680]   But here are his rebuttals in favor of single family houses.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:52.320]   Number one, that housing, single family houses, because they are not just in the investor
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.360]   marketplace, meaning that you're not just dealing with professional investors who are
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.760]   swapping properties around.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:04.480]   Single family houses can benefit from the potential for higher appreciation than multifamily
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.760]   because you've got people who may want to move in there.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.240]   They want to live there.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.160]   They're buying in the retail marketplace based upon what they want.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   They're liking the neighborhood there.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.440]   They move there and they want the house and you fix it up.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.480]   So you have a potential for higher appreciation than multifamily.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.320]   Great, great comment.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.320]   Great comment.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.320]   Let me give you my rebuttal.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   Go for it.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   My rebuttal is what's your end game?
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   Okay.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   It's a question.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.280]   Are you interested in cash flow or are you interested in flipping houses?
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   Okay.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.800]   If you're interested in flipping houses, John Schaub's model is fantastic.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   Okay.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.160]   Buy a house.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.040]   You know, maybe flip it right away.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.400]   Maybe sit on it for a while.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   Sell it.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.500]   Sell it within a few years.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:53.400]   But if you're interested in lifetime, long-term cash flow, then you're much safer in a multifamily
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.760]   property for the reasons I said.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.520]   If that house is empty, you're 100% vacant.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.520]   Okay.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.800]   Granted, yes, it does open up to all the buyers that are out there if you're in single family
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.840]   homes.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:11.480]   So if your goal is to buy and ultimately sell, then certainly houses should be on your horizon.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:18.320]   But if you're interested in lifetime cash flow, an annuity, something for your kids,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:25.240]   buying something that someone else is going to pay off, please consider multifamily instead.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.800]   That's my two cents on that one.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:33.880]   Number two, he talks about single family housing as being advantageous for low hassle management
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:42.240]   if purchased and rented out appropriately, meaning that not dealing with low-end properties,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.920]   but his model, buy a 322.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.720]   That way you're dealing with middle-class people.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.560]   And then you're not getting professional tenant.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.120]   By renting out that type of house, you're getting a higher quality tenant, and you have
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.520]   the potential for building a much longer-term relationship with the tenant.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.360]   I don't remember what the exact number was.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.280]   I respectfully disagree with that last comment about the longer-term relationship.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.280]   I've owned properties where people have been in there for literally 20 years.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   I'm looking at a 20-unit right now in my general area, 24-unit, I think, actually.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.640]   And there are people that have lived there for 30 years.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.480]   These are little duplex apartments.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.720]   So I don't agree with that last comment.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.080]   But listen, if you're going to buy houses, I completely agree with John.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.180]   Buy 322s because there's always a demand.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:36.520]   And yes, you can position the house, the renting of the house, so that it is less maintenance.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.040]   Typically, that involves a lower rent payment, though.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.960]   You drop your rents down a little bit, and you tell the tenant, "Listen, I'm going to
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.600]   give you this great deal on this place, but I don't want you to call me for every maintenance
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.880]   thing.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   If it's going to be over $100, then you call me and we'll work it out.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.480]   But if it's less than $100, I don't want to hear from you because I'm giving you this
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.220]   deal so that this is a hassle-free investment for me, too."
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.600]   And that is a great strategy.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.680]   And I think that might be what John's alluding to.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.280]   I've never actually read any of John's stuff.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.120]   I just know he's a local here, and he's a great guy with a great reputation.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.660]   But that's a way to do houses, and I did that with houses.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.600]   You can also do lease options on houses.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.160]   I did hundreds of those where you get a few thousand dollars up front, and you give an
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.400]   option to buy over a period of time, and they'll typically take better care of the house.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   That said, and I've tried all these strategies.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.440]   That said, I am interested in long-term wealth.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.760]   I'm interested in, and I was talking about the people I've interviewed, and that billionaire
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.120]   I interviewed.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.440]   I asked him, I said, "Do you sell?"
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.320]   And he said, "No, I'm not a real estate seller.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.400]   I'm a real estate buyer."
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.960]   And everybody that I've interviewed, they all regret ever selling any of their real estate.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.020]   It's always a regret.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.120]   They always wish they'd have held onto it because of what happens.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.120]   I tell you, my houses in Denver, I sold all those houses, and I sold them in the $100,000
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   range.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.080]   I just sold the house next door to my mom for $320,000 in Denver.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:08.040]   Now, if my dumb rear end hadn't sold my Denver houses, do the math on 500 houses at $320,000.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.560]   It's a big number.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:16.040]   So I have the same regrets, and that's why, to me, there's nothing else you can buy that
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.800]   someone else pays off.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.280]   There's nothing better than free and clear real estate.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.840]   I met a guy in Denver, an old Jewish guy, and I was looking at his apartment complexes.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.480]   This is decades ago, and I was just a 20-year-old punk, and I said, "Hey, you know, I want to
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   buy your apartments."
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   And he had them free and clear.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.840]   He was a funny guy, but he said something to me that I've never forgotten, and that
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.480]   was, "Son, if you buy apartments and you let other people pay them off, when they're free
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.920]   and clear, you will have buckets of money."
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:48.160]   And I've never forgot that visual of buckets of money, and so that's why I advocate for
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.640]   multifamily now.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:58.040]   But if you were starting over, a young man took away all your advantages, took away all
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:04.080]   your connections, and said, "You've got to start over today, 2016," how would you approach
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.840]   the challenge of starting with nothing and getting rich?
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.440]   Give me the actual steps.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.080]   Absolutely, and this is what I tell people.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:20.360]   I take free phone calls from people that listen to my thing, and I tell them, "Take two approaches,
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   okay?
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.000]   One, get out there and educate yourself, number one.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.500]   Take the courses or find the books.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.520]   You can learn a lot from podcasts.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.060]   Don't get me wrong, and that's a fantastic vehicle, but you really need more than that
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.200]   if you're going to get serious about real estate investing.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.820]   You need to know what a contract looks like.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:44.540]   You need to know the nuances of talking to sellers and brokers and bankers.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.660]   So number one, there's two tracks.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.220]   Track number one is educate yourself, okay?
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.140]   So you don't make the mistakes that I made, and trust me, I'm the poster child for mistakes
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.220]   because I did not do that.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.460]   I did not educate myself.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:00.740]   I'm a fire, fire, fire, fire again, and then think about ready and think about aim.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.540]   But I would educate yourself, number one.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.020]   Number two, get out there and immerse yourself in the marketplace.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:11.540]   Go kick the tires, go start talking to brokers, start evaluating properties, run the numbers
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.300]   on properties, learn, and do this in your backyard.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.760]   You know, learn about real estate.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.020]   Go to your local real estate investor club meetings.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.780]   I mean, that's where I just came from.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:27.020]   I did a little goal-setting workshop for mine, and there's really nothing in it for me anymore
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.620]   because I don't need to learn, but I do learn.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.540]   What's funny is I do learn when I do that anyway, but the point is get out there and
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.940]   actually immerse yourself in whatever it is you're going to do, be it real estate, be
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.900]   it anything.
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.700]   Immerse yourself in it because you're going to learn by doing.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.620]   But what people do sometimes, they'll do one or the other.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.340]   Like I did just the, I just did it, and I didn't learn, and I made so many mistakes.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:55.820]   Had I done the courses or learned more about what I was doing, I would have made a lot
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.140]   more money and saved myself a lot of heartache.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.620]   So I would do both of those simultaneously.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.340]   Actually be looking and educate yourself.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.900]   And that's what I would do if I had to go back in time to do it right.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.060]   So now next steps.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.580]   I'm a learner, I'm studying, and I'm out there doing.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.620]   What tactically am I doing?
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.620]   Okay, sure, sure, sure.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.720]   Remember, I alluded to this earlier, okay?
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.180]   And that is you don't need money to buy real estate, okay?
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:30.060]   What you need is knowledge, confidence, and the ability to influence, okay?
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:36.900]   And if you know what you're talking about, and you know your market, and you find a deal,
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.980]   and you're confident in your abilities, you'll be able to influence somebody to go in on
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.620]   it with you, okay, and put up the money.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.180]   I mean, I bought 500 houses.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.020]   Most of them, other people put up the money, and I got half the deal.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:53.820]   So that's what I would do is I'd get out there and I'd network, but I'd do the first two
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.820]   things I talked about.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.620]   I'd be out there looking at deals, I'd be understanding the market, I'd be learning
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:02.980]   everything I possibly could about the market, I'd be educating myself, and I'd be networking
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.700]   and talking about what I'm doing.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.140]   You know, if somebody, you know, have an elevator pitch.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:13.340]   If somebody literally is standing there, and you've got their attention for two minutes,
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.740]   they need to know what it is you do.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.860]   Hey, I look for fantastic deals in real estate.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.100]   I'm always looking for partners.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:23.620]   If you know anybody that, you know, wants x-ray to return, let me know.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.380]   You know, I find some great deals, and those are the things that I did.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.060]   That's what I did, and that's what I would do again.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:37.420]   How do you build a team, a company that does this so it's not just one person?
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:44.820]   Well, if we're talking about real estate specifically, you need somebody to help you with the numbers.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.020]   You need somebody to help you with the evaluation of the properties, and really, particularly
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.900]   if you're in a multifamily space.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.460]   I've got a CPA that's on my payroll.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:59.580]   And I've always had, you know, a high-end bookkeeper prior to having the CPA.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.380]   Somebody that can help you, you know, do an analysis, maybe do a proforma on the property.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.340]   You know, you want to know how to do it yourself.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:12.020]   You know, either have some evaluation software or, you know, be able to utilize Excel.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.860]   I would have, you know, a team.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:21.580]   I would have an attorney, a real estate attorney, somebody that's actually doing the types of
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.900]   deals you're interested in doing, be it residential, be it, you know, multifamily.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.780]   Ideally want an attorney that is actually an investor that owns his own property because
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.700]   then he really understands it.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.460]   I would have either a good title company, if that's what you have in your state, title
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.180]   companies, or sometimes it's just attorneys.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.420]   I would have a relationship with a title company.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:48.320]   I would go out there and meet as many brokers as possible in whatever caliber or sector
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.140]   of real estate you're interested in buying.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.860]   And those are the very important relationships.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.940]   You know, you buy them a cup of coffee, you tell them that, you know, tell them you're
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.940]   new if you're new.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.220]   Don't be afraid to tell them that.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.980]   And you won't get the, when you're developing broker relationships, you won't get the high-end
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.780]   brokers that are moving, you know, big tons of property.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:11.700]   They won't waste their time with you, but there'll be lots of brokers that will, and
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.700]   you'll learn a lot from them.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.060]   And you'll get referrals to good management companies.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.460]   You'll get referrals to good attorneys.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.700]   You'll get referrals to, you know, people that sell the insurance.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.700]   You'll get referrals to the bankers, the mortgage brokers.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.760]   And these people will all refer each other.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.740]   And that's the other thing you're going to need to develop a relationship with your local
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.660]   banker or with a mortgage broker for the financing for whatever caliber of property you need.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:40.160]   But again, all of this stuff, even building the team, you'll get if you've educated yourself,
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.840]   because any good course is going to talk about team.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.500]   And these are things that you really, and how to approach like a broker with, you know,
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.180]   because you need to know that a broker doesn't get paid unless the property actually closes.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.620]   So, you know, they don't want to have you tie up a property if you're not going to be
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.940]   able to pull the trigger on it.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:05.780]   So you need to know how to talk to them and reassure them and sell them basically.
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.300]   And so I think I've touched on most of the team there.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:13.020]   I mean, if you're going to be doing value-add properties where you want to fix a property
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.620]   up, then you're going to need a good maintenance man or a good contractor.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:23.240]   You know, I actually typically in every state that I've ever bought in, I've actually started
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.240]   a real estate company.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.820]   I've hired a broker, put them on my payroll and that way I have access to the MLS.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:34.300]   I am able to share in the fees that are collected when we buy or sell a property because I own
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.820]   the real estate company or own a part of the real estate company.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.620]   The broker typically has to own part of it as well.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.940]   But you know, I mean, there are lots of...
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.700]   You can take this thing a lot of different directions and, you know, a team is very,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.700]   very important.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.220]   I would go to your local real estate investor club meetings if you're thinking real estate
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.220]   and meet people there.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.220]   There'll be hitters there.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:58.020]   There'll be people that, you know, that might be able to be mentors to you.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.740]   I highly recommend that you do that as well.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:06.860]   And you know, if you're going to buy a larger property, a larger multifamily property, you're
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.460]   probably going to need what's called a sponsor.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.740]   And that's somebody that owns similar property that has a decent net worth that will sign
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.780]   on the debt for you.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.380]   And you're going to give away a chunk of the deal for that.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.540]   But that's okay to give away a chunk of the first one or two or three deals.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.140]   Because once you've got two or three deals, then you have the ability to take down a larger
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.140]   property.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.220]   But initially, you know, to buy a larger property, you're likely going to need somebody called
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.940]   a sponsor.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:37.740]   And you'll negotiate how much they get for the privilege of using them and their net
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.260]   worth and their experience to take down the property.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.900]   You've been broke and you've been rich.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:45.900]   I have.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.980]   I have been really broke.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.020]   And I've been doing pretty darn well too.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.340]   What is the best thing about being rich?
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:04.300]   Well, now if I answer that question today, it's the ability to give back.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.180]   If I answer that question 20 years ago when I was young and stupid, it was to be able
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:14.140]   to buy a Lamborghini and a Maserati and Corvettes and a Rolls Royce and Panteras and stupid
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.140]   stuff.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:21.700]   But today, the best thing and the best thing for me today about having money is security
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.260]   and peace and the ability to give back.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.380]   And just to be incredibly grateful, which I think you can do without being rich.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.380]   But if you certainly should do that anyway, whether you have money or not, you should
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.380]   be grateful.
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.980]   But it's definitely the ability to give back.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.900]   What changed between 20 years ago when you were young and stupid and today?
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:45.340]   Well, luckily, I met a guy named Tony Robbins 16 years ago.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.700]   And I was a real narcissist before then.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.700]   It was all about me, me, me.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.180]   How can I show them I'm good enough?
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.900]   How can I show them that I'm worthy?
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:00.140]   That was my mindset because it was tough coming from another country, not speaking English.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:06.360]   I get picked on at school and so I kind of felt the need to prove myself.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.500]   But I met Tony Robbins and was so blown away by his technology.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.700]   I've been involved with him for 16 years and actually do a lot of volunteer work with him
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.460]   and it changed my life.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.980]   So like what, 11 years ago, maybe it's been 16.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:31.620]   16 years ago, I formed a foundation to start feeding kids and went out and got the idea
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.620]   from him.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.840]   And my brother and I decided to feed five families for the holidays, for Thanksgiving
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.840]   it was.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.860]   And so we went and bought food and we found five families through a church that really
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:42.860]   needed help.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:49.100]   And I went to one of the doors and it was a really crappy house.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.920]   And it was like a shack.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.580]   And this woman came out, saw the food, it was the day before Thanksgiving and she started
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.580]   crying.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:01.780]   Her husband had left just not that long before then, like a few days before then.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.520]   And the five kids came out that she had and they all started crying and I was hooked.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.020]   And so the next year I did 50 families.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.420]   The year after that I did 100 and I doubled it every year, 200, 400, 800.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.140]   And then in 2007 I did 1600 families and I paid for it.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.020]   And just incredible joy.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.860]   Now since then I started taking donations because '08 happened and I was filled with
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.820]   fear and I formed a foundation and we've now fed 40,000 kids for the holidays.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.340]   And then a few years ago we started doing backpacks filled with school supplies and
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.300]   we have done thousands of backpacks filled with school supplies.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.980]   In fact, a week from Saturday we're doing it here in Sarasota.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.180]   We're doing 1500 backpacks.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:46.580]   It's just astounding to me that kids in the United States of America don't have the basic
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.660]   school supplies to be a success in school.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.540]   I just, don't get me started, that just makes me crazy.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.780]   But anyway, so we're doing 1500 backpacks here locally and then we also have given thousands
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.660]   of teddy bears to the local police departments for officers to keep in their vehicles when
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.060]   they encounter a child that's experienced some trauma of some sort.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.340]   And that has given me my greatest joy in life.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.220]   So that's what I would say to somebody.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:16.020]   That's the advantage of being rich or having money is the ability to share and give back.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:20.900]   When you were younger and more broke than you are now, I would imagine when you're dreaming
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.180]   about being rich, you were thinking of something.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.940]   What was the thing that you were dreaming of that life would be like when you were rich
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.500]   that turned out not to be so?
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.420]   Oh, good question.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.460]   What was I dreaming about?
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.820]   Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:43.700]   As you focus on the outcome, you focus on the goal and it's always a letdown when you
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.700]   achieve it.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.620]   I built this $10 million house on the...
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.460]   And I just told this to the guys in the goal setting workshop, so it's fresh.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.260]   I built this $10 million house and I'm floating in the pool.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.260]   Look at...
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.980]   It's at night and this pool was spectacular.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.880]   It was a waterfall from the second floor into the pool and it changed colors.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.880]   It had the...
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.060]   I forgot, the fiber optic lighting and it changed colors.
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.860]   I'm laying in this pool and I got depressed.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:12.660]   It's like I just built this huge testament to my ego and I'm depressed.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.520]   And I realized that it's never about the goal.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.580]   It's about who you become while you're trying to achieve the goal.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.820]   It's about the journey.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.340]   It's never about the outcome.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.540]   And like I told these people in this goal setting workshop, it's whenever you get close
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:31.420]   to reaching a big goal, you should definitely have other goals lined up because, you know,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.820]   like the good book says, without a vision, the people perish and you need a vision for
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.820]   the future.
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.660]   And I didn't have one at that point when I was floating in the pool and I didn't realize
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.660]   why I was depressed.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.860]   And I've learned now since then why that happened.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.740]   But you know, that's...
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:47.740]   There's my answer.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.740]   What else?
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   What else?
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:57.340]   Well, you know, I would tell you listeners, if you're thinking about getting into real
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.620]   estate investing or you think whatever any business that you're thinking about getting
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:05.180]   into, make sure that you have written goals.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.740]   Make sure that you have the whys for those goals written down.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:12.900]   Make sure that you incorporate giving back if it's to your family, if it's to doing something
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.980]   for your parents or your children or whatever.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.500]   Make sure that's incorporated in the whys.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.780]   And my advice would be get pictures of those goals.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.740]   I have pictures all over my workout room and my office of the things that I want, the things
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.980]   that I want to accomplish.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.980]   And it's funny.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.700]   I was just showing the people at this event my work, my planner, my Franklin planner,
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.700]   my daily planner.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:37.900]   And I've got pictures in the back that have been put in the sheets of plastic.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.940]   And they've been there for 16, 17 years.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.460]   And three fourths of those things I have now because, you know, I visualize them and I
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.260]   visualize as if I already had them.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.780]   So I would tell you guys that are listening, do that.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.540]   Do the goals, do the whys, do the pictures, visualize yourself as already having those
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.500]   things and you will get them.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.420]   So, you know, that's what else.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.740]   Do you have kids, Rod?
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.740]   I have two.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.540]   I have a 25 year old daughter.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:02.940]   She's in Japan teaching English.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:08.540]   And I have a 21 year old son that's here in Florida.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.540]   I'm trying to get him into real estate, but I'm not sure it's for him.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.940]   But he's just kind of coasting through it right now while he's deciding what he wants
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.940]   to do.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:21.500]   But how effective do you feel that you've been in teaching them the skills of wealth
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.220]   and passing on some of the lessons that you've learned to them?
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:29.180]   Embarrassingly ineffective because I didn't have much.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.980]   I spoiled them.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.420]   And like I bought them each vehicles when they turned 16.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.300]   And I would not recommend that to anybody.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.500]   If you've got young children, don't buy them a car.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.540]   Make them work for it.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.300]   That's one of my bigger regrets.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.140]   And I went through a nasty divorce, unfortunately.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.580]   And because I only had them half the time, I wasn't able to influence them like I would
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.580]   have liked to.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:55.620]   And I'm not going to get into the detail of how that manifested itself with the ex.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:01.540]   But no, I don't feel like I was nearly as effective as I could have been.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.180]   And I wish I had been.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.900]   Now I'm making up for lost time.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.940]   My son was at this goal setting workshop and he was very, very proud of me and is proud
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.940]   of me anyway.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.180]   And both of my children will be big successes.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.700]   But could I have done it better?
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.700]   Absolutely.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.560]   Well, it's a common challenge.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:29.900]   Because what happens is you grew up in relatively poor circumstances, buying clothes from Goodwill,
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.900]   using powdered milk.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.680]   And so you want to give your kids something better.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.720]   But the problem is that those circumstances in some ways, either you could say, well,
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.080]   maybe they shaped you or formed you.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.320]   You could at least say they contributed to who you were and to some of the things that
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:51.540]   drove you to work hard and to build certain attitudes and habits and character traits.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.480]   And then if you take those experiences away from your kids, as is common among wealthy
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:01.600]   parents wanting to give their kids something better, sometimes you deny those experiences
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.240]   that are going to be formative.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.420]   So I'm curious, in your interactions with other wealthy people or even just yourself,
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.800]   if you were going to give somebody some advice from just what you've learned, the hard way,
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.000]   the great way, whatever way, of how to work with children and train children around wealth,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.800]   how would you approach that advice?
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.240]   >>Well, I would definitely not give them everything.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   I would make them work.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.800]   I would instill a work ethic in them.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.360]   And that's a tough thing to do, particularly if you're in a fragmented home where you only
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   get them half the time.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.000]   That's another component.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.640]   Mom lets us do this.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.440]   Or while you have them, you want to give.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.100]   And there's a book called "The Five Languages of Love," and it talks about these five ways
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:53.100]   that everybody's got one way that they primarily give love.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.100]   And mine is giving.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.580]   Okay, mine's gifts.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:02.060]   And so that doesn't serve you when you're trying to raise a child to be self-sufficient
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   and to have a great work ethic and to want.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:11.320]   And like my son, for example, he's, like I say, he's 21.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:16.920]   And he throws it up at me that he's not in school right now.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.780]   He actually dropped out of college just recently to come work with me in this real estate.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.200]   But he throws it up at me that I didn't go to college, which I didn't.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.380]   I never have gone to a single class in college.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.320]   And I had a $50 million net worth in 2008.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.280]   And so, but I'm very well read and I'm very driven, which he's not.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:44.680]   And so it's very important that, obviously, he's using me as an example.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.280]   And I'm not a good example because I had such a drive that I went out there to learn.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.400]   And I'm always learning and constantly trying to learn and curious.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:58.260]   And so what I would tell parents that are listening is try to make your children as
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.240]   curious as possible.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.920]   Don't give them everything.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:07.940]   Make them work for it, even if it's painful, because they'll be so glad you did.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.720]   And I mean, we're working through it now.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.420]   My son and I are working through it.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.680]   And my daughter will be a huge success.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.200]   I already know that.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:23.040]   But I'm sharing things that have gone on over the last 10 years in my life with my children
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.520]   and the regrets that I have.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.720]   And you got me to be a little vulnerable here, Josh.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:29.720]   Good job.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.200]   I don't think I've ever talked about this publicly before.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:38.800]   But that'd be my advice, is to give them that work ethic.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.440]   And don't give them everything, because it spoils them.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.720]   It truly does.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.800]   And now my son's working hard.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   He's working two jobs.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.120]   And he's tired all the time.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.640]   And that's OK.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.240]   And that's what it takes.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:56.160]   So don't feel guilt about making them work and support themselves.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.160]   He's struggling.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.600]   He's got his own little place now.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   And it's tough.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.800]   But it's OK, because that's how you grow.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   That's how you get strong.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.480]   That's how you deal with when life kicks you in the butt.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.840]   That's how you get back up again.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.640]   Because if you don't train them to do that, when they fall, they're going to stay
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   down.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.080]   And as I mentioned, I've had 18 businesses.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.720]   Some have been successes.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.880]   Some have been spectacular failures.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.280]   But I've gotten back up every single time because of my work ethic, because of my goal
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.640]   setting, because of my visualization of the things that I want.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.120]   And you need to instill that in your children.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.960]   I would recommend you have them write their goals.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.760]   I would recommend-- my son has a vision board.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.680]   Have them do vision boards of the things they want.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:43.560]   Have them think about the future beyond their cell phones.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.600]   And so hopefully that answered your question.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   Yeah, it's really useful.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.320]   And I appreciate your being willing to share.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.480]   These are some of the things that matter.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.440]   And you mentioned vision boards.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.200]   It's easy to put a black Corvette on a vision board.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:08.240]   It's a little harder to put-- help my children to grow into confident, capable adults.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.000]   I will tell you, it's really not.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.960]   And I respectfully disagree.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.680]   Because my son is dyslexic, and he has a very hard time reading.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.200]   And so on my vision board, I have a picture of him reading when I'm reading to him.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.960]   And that prompted me for literally years to read to him every single night.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   And we did.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   Every night I had him, I read to him.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.080]   We went through the whole Harry Potter series.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.520]   So you can visualize what you want for your children.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.600]   And I will tell you, and I don't do it anymore, and I should start doing it again.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.720]   I used to visualize, I would sit and I would think about my children coming to me with
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.440]   their children and successful and happy.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.160]   And I would visualize them coming to me.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.920]   Because I will tell you guys, those of you listening, that stuff works.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.520]   It really works.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.720]   So visualize what you want in life, be it with your children, be it with your success,
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.640]   with your spouse, with your health, as if it's already there.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.400]   And do it with gratitude and you will get it.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.320]   Rob, it's been awesome.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   I appreciate you coming on.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.920]   Tell us about anything.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.280]   Tell us about your website, your podcast.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.280]   Oh, thank you.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.280]   Thank you.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   You're writing a book, I think, too.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.800]   Yeah, I'm writing a book and I'll give it to your listeners for free.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.080]   And it's going to be really damn good if I say so myself.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.200]   It's 200 pages on multifamily real estate investing.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:37.240]   And if any of you are thinking about it, text me, text the word Rod, my name Rod, to 41411
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.440]   and I'll put you on the list for it.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.800]   I'm not going to try to sell you anything.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.320]   Don't worry about that.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.840]   And don't hold me to, I'm hoping I'll have it done within 60 days.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.920]   It could be 90 days or even a little longer.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.760]   Those things go, but I will send it to you if you text me.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.520]   And if you're interested in multifamily real estate investing, please come listen to my
