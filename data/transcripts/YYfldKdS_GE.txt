[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Pastor John, I was tinkering around the other day with chat GPT and I asked it to spit out a tweet for me about artificial intelligence and Christian joy.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   And to write it all in your voice. Here's what it said, quote,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   "Artificial intelligence may bring new levels of convenience and productivity, but let us not mistake it for true joy.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Our ultimate satisfaction can only be found in Christ, who alone can satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts."
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   End quote.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Simplistic connections here, but not too bad. It does actually sound like you, but get this.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   That second sentence as it's written, "Our ultimate satisfaction can only be found in Christ, who alone can satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts."
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   That statement has never appeared in your written works or anyone's.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It has never appeared online anywhere, according to Google.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   From what I can see, it's an original sentence, which is wild.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   As you know, we're in the early stages of AI when large data sets can be crunched and synthesized
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and computers can essentially spit out what appear to be thoughtful responses to prompts.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Your ministry has produced one massive data set, to put it crudely, and a day is not far off.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   The baby is here already when people will be tempted not to go to this podcast or to your sermons or to books to hear from you.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   They'll simply prompt for a summary answer to what John Piper might say on a given ethical dilemma or Bible text.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And some AI model will spit out a summary response in text, or maybe even one day in your own spoken voice,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   or even in a video-generated response that looks like you talking.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It's all still very early. Much is going to change.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   But I want your early thoughts here, and to get us there, I want to put one subtopic aside and make one assumption.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   First, there are legal issues all over this, so let's put those aside for now.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Second, let's assume for the sake of today's episode that the generated text is actually pretty good
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   and a reasonably accurate representation of what you have said in the past.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   What's your first gut instinct here at the highest level?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   What would you want the age of computer-generated John Piper AI to hear from you in your own living voice
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   about how you want your legacy of works to be viewed in this coming age of artificial intelligence?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Well, I like that last question, focusing my attention on the highest level, which I'll try to do.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   But it's remarkable that this shows up right now, because just a few weeks ago in the faculty forum
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   at Bethlehem College and Seminary, where I teach and serve as chancellor,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   the issue of artificial intelligence and specifically, chat GPT, was part of the planned discussion.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And in preparation, one of our professors sent around the results of his request from chat GPT,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   which stands for chat generative pre-trained transformer, I learned.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And he had given the chat bot this instruction, write an essay on Augustine's view of disordered love.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And it produced a 400-word essay that I read, in which I suppose would get a passing grade
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   in your typical lit class in the university and for sure in high school,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   which of course is a great concern for teachers.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And there are, I learned also, plagiarism detection programs like Turnitin,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   T-U-R-N-I-T-I-N, all one word, Turnitin, which claim to be able to spot
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   artificially produced essays at about 99% accuracy.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So who knows, maybe with the advancing possibilities of cheating and calling AI productions your own work,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   there will be equal advances in software to detect that deception.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And as you point out, really not just as potential, but as realities,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   there are people right now producing artificial John Piper quotations and artificial John Piper voices,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   which are close enough to accurate that the average person won't know the difference.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But your question at this point, thankfully, because I'm no expert, is not about legal issues.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's not about detection possibilities.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It's about what's your first gut instinct here at the highest level.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   What would you want the age of computer generated John Piper AI to hear from you
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   in order for your own living voice to inform the world,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   what you want your legacy of works to be viewed as in the age of AI.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So my gut doesn't reach out first to my tongue.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   My gut reaches out first to my mind, where there's a lot of Bible up there circulating around.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And my gut consults with my mind and says, "Hey, mind, what does the Bible say or imply about this?"
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So here's my distillation about my answer or response to that way you pose the question.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Really high level. The biblical vision of Christian hedonism really does provide a remarkable framework
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   for responding to artificial intelligence.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   This was a surprise to me because I haven't thought about it before.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Remember, Christian hedonism says that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Now, what that does is elevate the spiritual affections of the human heart to the highest possible level
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   in the unique role that human beings play in the purposes of God in the creation of the world.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   God created the universe in order to put his glory on display and to communicate himself
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   to his creatures for our understanding and our enjoyment.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Psalm 19, 1; Isaiah 43, 7; Romans 1, 19-21; Romans 9, 20 and 23, and on and on.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   The purpose of God to glorify himself in creation reaches its God-intended climax
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   when human beings not only rightly understand but rightly feel the nature of God's reality
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   and the preciousness of his fellowship.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   God glorifies himself in the life of humans when those humans understand him truly in their minds
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and rejoice in him duly in their hearts.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   If either of those is missing, mind understanding or heart rejoicing,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   God is not glorified as he ought to be.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And if either of those is missing, the other one is flawed.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Right ideas without right rejoicing are barren, mechanical, and yes, you could say artificial,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   even in the human mind, not just in the computer.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   They're artificial in the human mind if they are not penetrated with rejoicing duly.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Rejoicing without right ideas, on the other hand, is like froth on a drink and not fruit on a vine.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   For right thinking to glorify God, it must be attached to right rejoicing in God.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And for rejoicing in God to glorify God, it must be rooted in right thinking about God.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   In other words, the spiritual affections of the human heart are of the essence
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   in the achievement of the purposes of God in creating the world.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   These spiritual affections, the affections of the human heart,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   will never be the product of computerized databanks.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And I say that not only because computers will never be human hearts,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   that is, they'll never be created as humans in God's image.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I say it also because not only are human hearts or souls of another nature
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   from computers and computer language, I say it also because, and this is even more significant,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   the God-glorifying, Christ-exalting human heart is a new creation
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   that is brought into being by a supernatural, not a natural, not a computerized,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   intervention by the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   It's called new birth or new creation or new person.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   The new creation in Christ, the newborn heart, the supernaturally created person,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   is the only person who can rejoice in God for who he really is.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   The eyes of the heart have been opened by the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   The spiritual beauty of Christ in the gospel is seen,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and the echo of this beauty in the heart is to trust him and rejoice in him and treasure him.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Those God-glorifying affections spilling over in outward acts of love
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   are the reason God created the universe, which means for chat-GPT
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   that it is quadruply cut off from God-intended purposes for intelligence.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   So here they are.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I'd say chat-GBT is quadruply cut off from God-intended purposes for intelligence.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   First, it is a kind of intelligence, not affections,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   but affections are of the essence in living a Christ-exalting, God-glorifying human life.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Second, this so-called intelligence is the product of a machine, not a heart,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   and the heart is of the essence of living a Christ-exalting, God-glorifying human life.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Third, the causes and effects of this so-called intelligence are all natural, not supernatural.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   But the Bible makes plain that the merely natural man and all the more natural computer
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   cannot be what humans are created to be, namely God-glorifying persons.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Fourth, this artificial intelligence is defective in the same way that a natural man is defective.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   It can rise no higher than the natural, fallen, unregenerate heart of man.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Intelligence, as God gave it at first, was designed not only to perceive natural,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   external reality and then assemble it, but also to see in it, to see through it,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   the reality of the glory of God, the greatness, the beauty, the worth of the infinite person who created us.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   When intelligence cannot do this, cannot spiritually discern, see, and feel that glory,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   it fails in the most important reason that intelligence exists.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   So, in answer to the question, I would like the legacy of my works to be viewed as the fruit
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   of a finite and fallible and imperfect human mind and human heart that were touched
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   by the supernatural work of God in Christ and enabled to see the glory of God and feel something of the worth
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   and reflect for the world the glory of God for the supernatural enjoyment of as many people as possible.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Hm. Quadruply cut off from God's intended purposes for intelligence.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for joining us today. If you want to ask Pastor John,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   the real, living, breathing, regenerate, God-centered, God-enjoying John Piper, that one,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   if you have a question for him, type it out and email it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Well, can we lie to women who are seeking abortions if by lying,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   it increases the likelihood that we can save a baby's life?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   When this question came in, it immediately grabbed my attention, and it's up next time.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. See you Thursday.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   [ Silence ]
