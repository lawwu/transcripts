[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words found in the portion
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.680]   of the scripture which we read at the beginning in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.120]   to Saint John. I'm looking at the paragraph which begins at verse 27 and goes on to the
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:28.360]   end of verse 38. And this is the beginning in verse 27. "And upon this came his disciples,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.680]   and marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.240]   talkest thou with her?" But as I say, I want to take a general look at the teaching which
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.200]   stands out supremely in the whole of the section that runs from the 27th verse to the end of
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.840]   the 38th verse. Now those who worship here regularly will know that we spent many months
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.280]   last year, starting this time last year, on this fourth chapter of John's Gospel, dealing
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.140]   with the first 26 verses. Now we did that in order that we might continue pursuing something
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.720]   which we started doing several years ago, which is this. We are working through this
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.920]   Gospel according to Saint John, not in the sense of a verse-by-verse exposition, but
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.480]   rather we are picking out what is, after all, the great theme of this Gospel. The Apostle
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   makes it perfectly clear in the first chapter as to what that theme is. It is that the Lord
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.680]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has come into this world to give us the right and the authority
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.320]   to become the children, the sons of God. That we may be filled with all his fullness, that
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.960]   we may receive of his grace and of his fullness, grace upon grace. Now that is the great theme
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.760]   of this Gospel. He keeps on saying this, "I am come that they might have life and that
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.080]   they might have it more abundantly." Or, as we have been seeing it at great length in
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.440]   the 14th verse, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.160]   but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.080]   everlasting life." That is the great theme of this Gospel, this fullness, this abundant
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.240]   life which the Lord Jesus Christ has come into the world to give us. And what we are
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.520]   concerned to do is to find out how this is to be obtained, how can we receive this. And
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.600]   we have been seeing how, in the various incidents that are recorded, we are given an account
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.040]   of the difficulties, the obstacles, the hindrances to this. Can we all say this morning, of his
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.360]   fullness, have I received, and grace upon grace, can I say of assurity that I have got
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.840]   this well of water in me, springing up into everlasting life, that I don't thirst. As
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.560]   he says, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst."
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.440]   Now this is the great question, is this true of us? And we saw in dealing with the story
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.040]   of this woman of Samaria in general, as you get it up until the end of the 26th verse,
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.240]   we see many of the difficulties and the hindrances and the obstacles, the prejudices, the misunderstandings,
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.160]   the fumbling. And we are aware of all these things in our own lives and experiences, or
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.720]   at inner it have been aware of. And then we have also seen how our Lord enables us to
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.400]   overcome these things, how he deals with us, and how he gives us this marvelous and wonderful
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.640]   positive teaching. Well now, we come to the stage at which we see the result of all this,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.040]   in the case of the woman of Samaria. And that is what begins at this 27th verse. All the
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.800]   rest, you see, is the account of our Lord's dealings with her. Now then, we are going
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.440]   to look at the result of all this. And it's very important that we should do that, because
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.360]   the result in a sense is always the same. And as we have tested ourselves in terms of
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.760]   the difficulties and the obstacles, we can test ourselves also in terms of this result.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.760]   This is a most practical matter, and that is why we deal with it together.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.000]   Well now, before we do that even, we've got to do something else again. Before we look
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.160]   at the result of all this and the effect of all this upon the woman of Samaria, we've
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.880]   got to remind ourselves once more of who it is that makes all this possible. I believe
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.000]   that one of the greatest dangers confronting us all at the present time is to keep on talking
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.120]   about Christianity instead of talking about Christ, instead of talking about the Lord
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.760]   Jesus Christ. We start with ourselves, we start with our problems and our difficulties,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.240]   we start with the world as it is, and we end with it. And people are interested in the
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.320]   application of Christianity to this, that, and the other. Now of course that's all right,
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.640]   we've got to do that, but I feel that our greatest danger is that in doing all that
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.440]   we forget all about him. And we turn Christianity into a sort of philosophy, a kind of view
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:57.080]   of life. Or indeed we may even turn it into a collection of doctrines and of teachings
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.840]   concerning him. This is a constant danger. It's a danger to everybody who is a Christian.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.560]   The devil sees to it that we tend to do this sort of thing. The whole emphasis today is
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.080]   upon this practical application. But there are others, I say, who seem to have lost the
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.520]   Lord himself in the doctrines concerning him. And they approach the doctrines, a body of
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.040]   truth, a number of propositions, in a theoretical and academic and a purely intellectual manner.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.160]   Now all this, of course, is right. But, I say, if we stop at all that, and if we've
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:42.400]   forgotten him, and if we've forgotten our relationship to him, we shall soon be in trouble.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.680]   And in any case, we are missing and failing to enjoy what is, after all, the greatest
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:59.920]   blessing of all. And that is our relationship to him, in a personal sense. Now this is the
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:07.680]   thing, you see, therefore, on which we must concentrate. That hymn, that paraphrase which
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.360]   we've just been singing, you've noticed, it's the paraphrase of the epistle to the
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.200]   Hebrews, chapter 4, verses 14 to 16. And it puts it so wonderfully and so gloriously.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.440]   Why have we got these gospels? Why are they ever written? Well, they've got two main
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:31.200]   functions. One is, of course, to establish the facts concerning our Lord, and to remind
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.680]   us constantly of who he is and what he is. But they have an additional function, and
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:45.440]   that is to remind us that he is still the same, that as he was on earth, he is there.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.800]   In every pang that rends the heart, the man of sorrows bears a path. The high and exalted,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.640]   and at the right hand of God in the glory of a lost thing. He still remembers what he
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.360]   suffered and endured in this world. This is the whole object of all this. He's still
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.760]   the same one who spoke to the woman of Samaria by the side of the well. And what characterized
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:16.800]   him then is the very thing that characterizes him now. So, before we consider what happened
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:25.200]   to the woman, we must again start with him. The great question for all of us is this.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:33.360]   Do we know him? Are we able to go to him? Are we able to speak to him? As this woman
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:40.320]   spoke to him, as the disciples spoke to him, this is the thing, after all, that matters.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:47.280]   If our faith, if our Christianity that we talk about is not of value to us in the details
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.200]   of life and in the ordinary circumstances, well then I say there is something tragically
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:59.960]   wrong with us. And the very heart and center and nerve of this is to tell us that it is
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:09.360]   possible for us to know him and to go immediately and directly to him. So, we must look at him
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:16.880]   again. You see, he dominates the situation always, even in the secret. He is still the
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.120]   most important person. Well, now what do we find here? Let me just
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.280]   open up some of these things for your consideration. Oh, they're wonderful. They're the most
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:36.080]   comforting, they're most consoling, and they're most encouraging. You see, the trouble is
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:45.280]   the Church so often has done things which hide him from us. Ceremonial and ritual, others
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.320]   brought him and put between us and him, and he's banished away to some distance, and
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.120]   people don't derive the great benefits of the Christian life. But here they are in the
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.920]   New Testament, open before us. And the great thing we all have to realize is the truth
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.000]   concerning him. Well, now what do we find? Well, I've divided
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   what we are told just in this paragraph into two main headings. There are certain general
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.640]   things which we are told about him here, and then there are certain things which are more
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:24.080]   particular and which he himself brings out in his teaching.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:30.560]   The first comment I've got to make is upon the opening of this 27th verse. It reads like
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:37.600]   this, "And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with a woman,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:44.760]   etc." Now, this expression "upon this," it isn't the best translation. It's true
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:51.040]   in a sense, but a better way of translating is this, "just then," or even better still
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.760]   is "at that moment." What moment? Well, obviously connecting up with what has just
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.080]   gone before. Our Lord was instructing this woman, and she says to him, "I know that
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:09.360]   the Messiah is coming, which is called Christ. When he is come, he will tell us all things."
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:18.480]   Jesus says unto her, "I that speak unto thee am he." At that moment, his disciples
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.600]   came. Just then, just as he'd said that, the disciples came.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:31.960]   Now, what is the significance of this? Well, this is to me one of those glorious things
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:39.240]   that you find so constantly in the Scriptures. A man wrote a book a few years back which
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:44.840]   I think he called "Golden Nuggets" in the New Testament, and he's quite right.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.960]   There are golden nuggets here, but you've got to seek for them, and if you take the
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.200]   trouble to do so, you will find how wonderful they are. What is meant by this is this. You
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.080]   mustn't think that the disciples interrupted the conversation. That's what we attempted
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.800]   to do. Here is our Lord speaking to the woman of Samaria, but the disciples come back. You
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.760]   remember they'd gone to buy provisions. They were all very tired, and they hadn't
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.520]   had food, and our Lord was weary with his journey, we are told. Being wearied with his
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:26.360]   journey, he sat thus on the well. He hadn't gone with them, but they've gone, and they've
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.600]   got the provisions. And just as he was talking with the woman, back they come, and the conversation
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:36.960]   is interrupted. That's quite wrong. That is to miss the glory of this particular teaching.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:43.400]   It doesn't mean that the disciples returning interrupted the conversation, but what it
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:50.480]   does mean is this, that just as he had finished saying to this woman what he had intended
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.360]   to say, and what he wanted to say, just as he finished, they came back. Now, you see,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:07.240]   he's reached the climax. "I that speak unto thee am he." He's delivered his message.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.160]   After he has delivered his message, immediately afterwards, or just as he is finishing the
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:21.320]   delivery of his message, the disciples come back. This, you see, is one of these things
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:29.360]   which should give us such comfort and consolation. What it means is that he is always in charge
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:38.360]   of the situation. He knows everything. Nothing is accidental. All his conversation with this
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:44.320]   woman was so arranged that he should have finished his statement, made his declaration,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.480]   before the disciples came back. Nothing can interrupt his work. Now, we tend to think
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:57.680]   that this is so, but that's a fallacy. It's our self-importance that makes us think that.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:04.080]   Nothing can interrupt his work. What he has purposed, he will always do. He's in control
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.520]   of the entire situation. He can control time, he can control persons. There is nothing that
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:17.040]   he doesn't control. He knows everything. You see, we've already seen how he knew all
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:24.800]   about this woman, and she was astonished at it. He knew about her immoral life. He knew
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:31.480]   that she'd had five husbands. She doesn't understand this. She's amazed at this. But
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.040]   this is simply the truth about him. He knows everything. You see, we are told already at
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.240]   the end of the second chapter that when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover on the feast
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.400]   day, many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did. But Jesus did not
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:51.500]   commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.740]   of men, for he knew what was in men. And in the same way, we've seen how he knew exactly
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:03.720]   the position of Nicodemus, and so can cut across his conversation. There is nothing
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.680]   that he doesn't know. Now here, it seems to me, is one of these great principles that
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:15.800]   we should always bear in mind. There is nothing about us that he doesn't know. There is nothing
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:23.400]   about our circumstances that he doesn't know. And he is the Lord of all circumstances. There
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:30.240]   can be no interruption. His plan is perfect, and he will certainly carry it through. You
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:36.160]   see, we are so self-important, as I say, and put such emphasis upon our decisions as if
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:43.280]   the Lord is kept waiting by us, my dear friend. Get rid of that notion. He is always in charge.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:51.920]   He knows what he's doing. He knows the way he take it. And I will walk with him. Just
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:16:02.120]   at that moment, not before, not after, just at the right moment, the disciples come back.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.840]   Do you realize, I ask, that you are in the hands of this Lord, this blessed person, this
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:16.600]   one who is in charge and in control of the entire universe. He has said, "All power
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:22.960]   is given unto me in heaven and in earth." Very well, we are just looking at him in general
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.360]   as he appears before us in this incident. And then the next thing we notice is that
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.520]   he does surprising things. "Upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:41.240]   with a woman." They didn't understand this. Of course, they didn't understand this because
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:50.120]   they were Jews and they were creatures of tradition. And it was the teaching of the
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.680]   rabbis, the rabbinical teaching. And they'd made an absolute law of this. That a man was
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.080]   not to speak to a woman in a public place. A husband should even speak to his wife in
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   public if they happen to meet accidentally on a street. They were not to speak. A man
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   was not to speak to a woman like this in public at all. That was a part of their difficulty.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:17.200]   Not only that, of course, the further reason we've already seen was that she was a Samaritan
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.320]   and still more her particular character. Well now, here you see, we are all creatures of
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:29.760]   these prejudices and we've got our preconceived notions and ideas. And we often get into trouble
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.120]   in our Christian life, before we come into it and after we've come into it, because
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:40.800]   we are bound and fettered by these things. But he breaks through them all. He smashes
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   through them all. And this is one of the first things we've got to realize about him. He
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:52.760]   does things that are utterly unexpected by us. He does sometimes the very exact opposite
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.880]   of what we think he should be doing. But you see, this just opens out to us, doesn't it,
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:05.640]   the utter folly of trying to dictate to him, of trying to tell him what he should do. We
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.520]   need to cultivate the attitude and the spirit of these disciples, who though they don't
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.480]   understand behave in the right way. We are told that they marveled that he talked with
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:22.360]   a woman, yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her. They had enough
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:30.480]   sense to say nothing. And this is one of the lessons we learn in passing. His ways are
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.400]   not our ways, neither are his thoughts our thoughts. As the heavens are higher than the
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:43.200]   earth, so are his thoughts and our thoughts, and his ways and our ways. So the first lesson
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:50.240]   we have to learn is this, that you're dealing with this great and glorious person, and you
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.880]   must shed your prejudices, your preconceived notions and ideas. You mustn't turn your
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.320]   Christianity into something which is just set and formal and polite and respectable
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:07.760]   and so ordered. No, no, abandon yourself. Just look at him and watch what he does. Be
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.640]   open to his leading. You never know which way he's going to take you. You never know
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:20.080]   what he's going to do. He does things which to us, I say, are unusual and strange and
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:25.600]   which seem to us at times to be wrong. Now, I mustn't stay with this, but you see, this
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.280]   was the whole tragedy of the Pharisees and the scribes when our Lord was in this world.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.960]   Here were these people. Now remember, they were godly people. They were religious people.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.160]   But they were always being stumbled by him. He seemed to them to be a lawbreaker. You
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.960]   see, they were so narrow and rigid in their ideas of the Sabbath and so on, that when
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:53.720]   they saw him healing a man on the Sabbath, they said, "This is breaking the law."
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.920]   They didn't realize that the Sabbath was made for men and not men for the Sabbath.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.680]   These are the legalisms and the prejudices that we tend to carry with us into the Christian
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:11.840]   life. And therefore at times we'll be shocked and amazed at what he does with us. Or his
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.760]   treatment of us or his handling of some situation. And we marvel and we tend to gongle and congress.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.760]   Now let's learn the lesson from these disciples. Don't say anything. If you don't understand,
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.240]   remember that he knows what he's doing. Have this faith in him. Keep silent. Go on.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.200]   Follow. Let him lead you. Your business is to follow him on.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:37.000]   And that leads me, of course, to this next thing which comes out here in general, which
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:49.880]   is the fact that he is one who always commends respect. He is always to be approached with
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:57.700]   reverence and with awe. Though these men don't understand and though they marvel, I say they
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:03.280]   keep silent. Why? Well, there was something about him. And this is something you find
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:09.160]   running right through the Gospels. And oh, how important it is for us periodically, it
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:15.120]   is to stand back and to just look at him again. To see him as he was here on earth. And to
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:22.240]   remember that he's the same one but now infinitely glorified there above the heavens at the right
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:31.520]   hand of God. And therefore we are delivered from what is a temptation to some to approach
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.400]   him with an easy familiarity. Now, there's a paradox here. I'm going to tell you before
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.280]   I close this morning about his condescension and how the woman of Samaria can speak to
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.560]   him and the disciples can speak and they can put their questions. Yes, and yet at the same
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:59.000]   time there is this about him that holds them back. Yet no man said, "Why seekest thou?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.320]   What seekest thou? Or why talkest thou with her?" Read the story concerning him in the
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:14.400]   Gospels and you'll see how he could silence his enemies. You remember how they came, the
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.280]   very soldiers that came to arrest him, when they saw him they fell back. He was just a
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:26.120]   carpenter. He just appeared to be an ordinary man and yet there was this about him always
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:32.360]   which created this sense of awe, this sense of respect, this sense of someone other. And
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:37.480]   as you read the stories and the miracles and his teaching you'll find that they were amazed.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.720]   They said, "This man speaketh with authority and not as the scribes." They were filled
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   with marvel. They praised God or they worshipped God. They said, "We've seen strange things
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:55.040]   today." Now, my dear friends, let's remember this. Let us remember that we are here in
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   the realm of the miraculous, the supernatural, the divine. Let's remember that we are dealing
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:09.720]   with the everlasting and eternal God in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Now,
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:15.560]   these are things that stand out on the surface. But come, let us listen to his own teaching
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:25.800]   as we find it in this paragraph. You notice his self-revelation. And he puts it in terms
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:36.640]   as he so generally did of "I" and "you." "I sent you." "My meat," he says, in contradistinction
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.760]   to the disciples, they prayed him saying, "Master, eat." But he said unto them, "I
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:50.600]   have meat to eat that you know not of." "I," "you." "My meat is to do the will of him that
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:57.440]   sent me and to finish the work." "Your meat is this which you've bought in the nearby
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:05.540]   village." Now, here is something, you see, again that should be basic and fundamental
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:11.680]   in all our thinking. It's a tragedy that I even have to mention such a point as this.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.640]   That we are living in an age when people who call themselves Christian don't seem to believe
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:23.360]   any longer in his unique deity. They not only believe that he is a man, they are capable
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:30.680]   of believing that he was a poet. If there is any suggestion of such thinking in your
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:35.200]   approach to him, well, don't be surprised if you don't know these great blessings,
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.720]   if you haven't received of his fullness and grace upon grace. This is the very beginning
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:48.080]   of it all. He is not a man. He is a man, but he is not only a man. He stands amongst us
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:54.640]   as a man amongst men, but he says, "I," "you." He is not in series with us. He is not one
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.720]   of us in that sense. And we must get rid of this notion. You see, the devil is so subtle.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:08.560]   I'm not querying the motives of these men who teach these blasphemous heresies. But
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.920]   they go wrong because they don't approach these things in the right way. You see, they
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.680]   say, "If he's to help the modern man, well, then he must be like the modern man." So
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.480]   they reduce him to our level. And so he can help the perverts by being something of a
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.960]   pervert himself, and so on. You see, that's the whole tragedy. It's the wrong way around.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:33.480]   You start with him. And the only hope of our salvation this morning is that he's not one
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:41.400]   of us, that he can say, "I." He is the great I Am that I Am. He is the Lord Jehovah appearing
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:50.120]   as the Son in the flesh. I and you. Now, if there is any query or question in our minds
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:57.360]   with regard to his blessed person, there is no hope of any blessing. You immediately reduce
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:03.480]   him to the level of an earthly human teacher. And he's just one in series with the great
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:10.000]   men of the ages. But it's a lie. It's wrong. You see, this is the thing that these disciples
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.400]   caught. They still are very unlearned and they're lacking in understanding of him and
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:20.200]   of his way. But they've felt already something, and that's what keeps them quiet. And then
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:28.800]   he puts it plainly to them as he put it to the woman, "I that speak unto thee, am he."
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.160]   But then, in order to make this still more plain and clear, he goes on and puts it like
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:44.640]   this about himself. "My meat," he says, "is to do the will of him that sent me." And this
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:53.560]   is just his other way of saying who he is. He doesn't belong to this world by nature.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:27:00.960]   He has come into the world. He has been sent into the world. This, of course, is just another
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.880]   way of summing up the whole of what we read in the Prologue in the first chapter. This
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.800]   is just another way of saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:15.960]   the Word was God, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." It's just another way
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:24.240]   of saying that "him that sent me." Now, again, you see, this is one of these basic things.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.720]   I unfortunately have to say these things because of this foolish age in which we live which
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.760]   talks about tolerance and says that though a man may not believe the truth about the
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.400]   person, he can still be a Christian if he does good and so on and so forth. My dear
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   friends, there is no Christianity if that's true. This is one of these things about which
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:54.000]   there is no discussion. There is no well of water springing up into everlasting life if
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.400]   Jesus of Nazareth was only a man. These infidels have their own consistency. They say that
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.160]   he hadn't even got this himself, you see, that he was a fallible man and a failure and
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:14.720]   ignorant and so on. So there's no hope for us and there was failure in him. But oh, how
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.280]   wrong this is. Our whole salvation this morning depends upon the fact that God has sent into
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:28.600]   the world his only begotten Son. The Word was made flesh. Man, yes, but God, the eternal
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:35.640]   Son, taking unto him human nature. I, you, I'm the sent one, I have come into the world.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:42.880]   This was what he kept on saying, I am come. He doesn't say I was born. I am come. He's
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:53.080]   a visitor. God hath visited and redeemed his people. If we're not clear about all this,
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.960]   I say it's not surprising that we don't know about the fullness and that we don't know
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:05.640]   about the well of water springing up into everlasting life. Let's realize then that
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:10.440]   what we have here is just another way of saying that when the fullness of the times was come,
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:17.960]   God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:25.200]   the law. I am come. He's the sent one. But well, let's go on. He takes it on himself.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:34.360]   He says that my meat, he says, my whole purpose, my meat is to do the will of him that sent
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:48.720]   me and to finish his work. You see the content of that? There's the whole of Christianity
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:56.560]   for you in a nutshell. Why has this person come into this world? Why is this blessed
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.360]   Son of God speaking as men to the woman of Samaria? What's he doing here? Why has he
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:11.120]   come? And he tells us, he has come to do the will of God, the will of him that sent me.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:19.760]   What does that mean? Well, you see, this is Christian salvation. He has come to carry
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:27.200]   out God's plan of salvation. That's what he's doing in this world. He's not merely
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.880]   here to teach us, that's a part of it. For all the plan of God is for the redemption
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.200]   of the world. This is the great plan conceived in the mind of God before the very foundation
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:47.120]   of the world. That hidden mystery about which the Apostle Paul so delights to write. He
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:51.160]   says, you know, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.440]   world or the princes of this world that come to naught, but we speak the wisdom of God
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:02.680]   in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world and to our glory.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:08.320]   Or as he puts it in writing to the Ephesians, this is the purpose, that in the dispensation
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:14.640]   of the fullness of times, he, God, might gather together in one all things in Christ, both
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:24.720]   which are in him and which are on earth, even in him. That's what he's here for. So we
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   mustn't think of it only in subjective terms of what it means to us. That's all right,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.280]   we've got to do that, thank God for it. We are to enjoy this personally, but let's
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:43.960]   see, I say, the whole grand, glorious purpose, the will of him that sent me. He is a messenger,
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:51.440]   he is an envoy, he is one who has been given an allotted task. And the way, I say, to be
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.600]   delivered from so many of the shallows and the miseries of the Christian life, which
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.520]   we should never be in at all, is to just look up and to look at him and to see this grand
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:10.920]   and glorious unfolding purpose, the will of him that sent me. And he adds to that, and
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:19.960]   opens it out still further, to finish his work. What does this mean? Well, you see,
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:25.800]   here it is, this is a summary of all that he came to do. What he means is this, that
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   he has come into this world to finish this work which God has sent him to do. And what
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   is that work? Well, it is the salvation of the world. It is your salvation, it is my
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:45.880]   salvation, but it is the salvation of the world. Now, this is the antidote to every
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:54.400]   form of depression, every form of spiritual depression. He has not merely come to experiment,
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:00.760]   he has not merely come to try to do something, but he has come to finish it. There were certain
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.640]   things that had to be done before you and I could be saved. If you and I are longing
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.680]   for this well of water that springs up into eternal life, we have got to understand the
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:15.040]   way of salvation. We cannot get this otherwise. We cannot receive of his fullness and grace
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.960]   upon grace unless we are perfectly clear as to how that is made possible. How can one
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   ever get this glorious Christian experience that the saints of the centuries of old have
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.240]   enjoyed? Well, my dear friend, you can never get it until you are clear about the way of
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.800]   salvation. Now, many people do not realize that, and that is why they spend the whole
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:42.160]   of their lives in seeking. This, of course, is the basic error of what is called mysticism.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:48.420]   There is a true mysticism, there is a false mysticism. The true mysticism is the mysticism
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:53.740]   of this personal relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ in the way that is indicated
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:59.560]   in the New Testament. The false mysticism is that which really bypasses the work which
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.320]   he has come to do, the work which he has finished. You see, what the mystic does is this. He
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.800]   starts by saying, "God is in you, and what you must do now is to seek the God that is
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:16.600]   in you." So you go through a process of meditation and contemplation and so on, the
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:22.800]   dark night of the soul. You go through this long cultural process, and at last you may
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:28.160]   get some sort of an experience. What it is, one does not know. It can be purely psychological.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.880]   It can make people happy. At times, there are very few that succeed in getting through
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:38.560]   with it. But my point is that that is not Christianity at all. This is it. There is
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:46.280]   only one way to this blessed fullness of which he speaks, and that is to realize that it
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.480]   is only possible as the result of his finished work. Now, so many people, they go to God
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.720]   in trouble and they pray, and they are surprised they are not answered. Many Christians go
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.840]   to God and do not get satisfaction. Again, it is because they are forgetting this. These
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:11.520]   things are essential. There is a finished work. Now, this could keep us, of course,
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.640]   for a great length of time. I am only mentioning it in passing because we are looking at him
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:22.600]   as he is and as he enunciates these basic questions.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.720]   You remember his high priestly prayer. You will find it recorded in the seventeenth chapter
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.680]   of this Gospel according to St. John. You should always read what he says here in the
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:38.720]   light of that. He says, "Father, the hour is come. Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.040]   may glorify thee, as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.480]   life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they might know
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:53.760]   thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. I have glorified thee on the
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.240]   earth. I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:04.240]   Now, there he sums it up. What is this work? Well, it is all that he gave in his teaching.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:10.120]   It is all that he manifested in his person and power, but supremely. It is what he went
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.920]   on to talk about in that seventeenth chapter as it is recorded in the seventeenth chapter.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:23.400]   I sanctify myself. He gives himself to the death of the cross to finish the work which
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   thou gavest me to do. To finish his work. What is it? Well, it is, you see, to redeem
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:36.720]   us, to reconcile us to God. There is no hope for us until we are reconciled to God. It
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:41.360]   is no use seeking blessings from God until you are reconciled to God, until you realize,
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.520]   in other words, that you have sinned against God, that you are guilty before God, that
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.760]   God's wrath is upon you, and that God will not bless a sinner. He may grant him certain
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.800]   temporal or general blessings, but he will never give him this ultimate, the greatest
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.960]   blessing of all, which is the knowledge of God and of his Son, that is, eternal life.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:08.000]   No, no, this is only given to those who are covered by the finished work of Christ, which
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.160]   means that we realize that the only way whereby we can be reconciled to God is that God has
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:24.440]   laid our sins upon his own Son. This is the finishing of the work, that he goes as a lamb
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:30.240]   to the slaughter, that he yields himself passively, that he allows the Father to lay upon him
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.520]   the sins, that he becomes the Lamb of God, that he does not grumble and complain, and
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:40.240]   that God smites him and strikes him. And there he finishes the work of this grand redemption
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:47.960]   and cries out, "It is finished." And then he rises again to justify us, and there he
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:56.760]   ever liveth to make intercession for us. Now, that is what he is saying here. This is what
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:06.120]   he has come to do. He has come to do the will of him that has sent him, and to finish the
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:13.880]   work. And he finished it. Nothing could stop him. All the powers of hell arrayed against
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:20.160]   him, couldn't stop him. Very well, my friend, have you realized this? Do you always realize
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.440]   this when you go to him, or when you see God in prayer, that the only way into the presence
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:32.120]   of God is by the blood of Jesus? Without the finished work, there is no access. And if
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.920]   you are not clear about these fundamentals of the Christian faith, it is no use you are
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.480]   seeking this well of water springing up into everlasting life. It is no use you are seeking
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.840]   the fullness. It is no use you are seeking some high spiritual experience. You will spend
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:50.080]   the rest of your life seeking. You will never get it. This is only the possession of those
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:59.720]   who realize the truth concerning his finished work, the plan of God in redemption, which
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:07.480]   is Jesus Christ and him crucified. Without this atoning death, no blessing is offered
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.040]   to us, and you have no right to expect any blessing.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:18.200]   And then, for me to complete this picture this morning, you notice his zeal in this
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:25.240]   work which he has been sent to do, in this commission that has been given to him. Oh,
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:34.400]   what comforting words these are. "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me."
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.360]   They do not understand this, but this is it. "I have meat to eat," he says, "that
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   you know not of." They do not understand him. They are pressing him to eat meat. He
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:52.360]   does not do so. Why not? "Well," he says, "for one thing you know, though I am a
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:58.200]   man and though I need food and though I know what it is to be weary and tired, oh, these
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:04.240]   are not the things that control me. I have hidden resources that you do not understand.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.840]   I have sources of satisfaction beyond anything that you have ever imagined." What he is
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:13.880]   really saying is this, you see. He says, "Yes, I stayed here and I let you go and buy the
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   provisions because I was feeling tired, but you know now I do not need the food. I am
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.520]   absolutely refreshed." Why? "Well, I have been doing the very thing I was sent to do.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.480]   I have been engaged in spiritual activity. I have been handling a soul. I have brought
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:34.760]   a woman to the place of understanding and of joy. I can live on this. This is my meat
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:40.760]   and this is my drink. These are the resources. These are the things by which I live." His
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:50.160]   meat and drink. What a tremendous consolation for us that the Son of God not only came,
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:56.920]   but he came with delight, he came with pleasure. He enjoyed doing this work for you and for
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:04.480]   me. And you can be certain that in exactly the same way he enjoys working for you now,
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.640]   ever living to make intercession for you, ever ready to listen to you. It is his meat
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:15.280]   and drink. This was the thing that ravished his soul. This is the thing that filled him
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.960]   with delight and glory. But you see there is another thing hidden here in this same
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:28.320]   statement, isn't there? And that is his utter forgetfulness and his readiness to sacrifice
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:37.720]   himself. He needs the food in a sense. But you see when it becomes a question of handling
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:43.000]   this soul and the possibilities of what can be done to the Samaritans through this woman,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.840]   he forgets food and drink. He is not interested in them for the time being. He gives himself.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:54.720]   They press him. You see the words are very strong. We read here that they prayed him,
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:42:00.120]   tried to persuade him. They brought pressure to bear upon him to make him eat. His disciples
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.880]   prayed him saying, "Look here, you are tired and you need food. You must do this.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.840]   It will be too much for you. You will break down under the strain." His mother and his
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.960]   brothers did the same thing. It is recorded in one of the other Gospels. They said, "He
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.360]   is beside himself. He cannot go on like this. He is going to break down." Of course they
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:20.080]   did not understand. They did not know about the food to eat that they knew not of. And
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.560]   in any case they did not understand this. Well, this is involved. He forgets everything.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:33.360]   He sacrifices himself completely for the sake of this woman's soul and the souls of the
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:41.040]   others. And he is still the same, my dear friends. This is the very essence of the Gospel.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:46.280]   This is the thing which we are told everywhere in the New Testament. Perhaps it is stated
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.920]   supremely and most perfectly of all in that well-known passage in the second chapter of
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:57.800]   Paul's epistle to the Philippians. Here it is. "Let this mind be in you, which was
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:03.640]   also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.080]   with God." In other words, he did not hold on to that. He did not say, "Well, yes,
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.120]   I am prepared to help those people, but I cannot give up the signs of my eternal glory."
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.640]   That is what it means. He did not regard this as a prize that he was to hold on to at all
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:22.160]   costs. No, no. He laid it aside. He laid aside the signs. "He made himself of no reputation,
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.920]   and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:31.560]   found in fashion as men, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:40.240]   of the cross." This is it. Self-forgetfulness, self-abnegation, self-abasement. These things
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.760]   do not stand in the way. He puts them aside as he put the food and the drink aside here
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.680]   in order to help these people. "For you and for me he put aside the insignia of the
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.760]   everlasting glory, and humbled himself and became a man, and suffered and was tempted,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:03.720]   yes, even the death of the cross, and the shame accompanying it, and be buried in a
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:10.560]   grave." This is his meat and drink. This is his concern for you and for me. Now the
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:15.600]   whole object of recording this, I say, is that you and I should remember this. As you
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.800]   go to him in your need, remember all this about him. "In every pang that rends the
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:30.560]   heart the man of sorrows bears a part. For there in that excellent and eternal glory
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:36.840]   he looks at you with a rather sympathizing eye. He is aware of it and he is with you."
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.760]   This is the whole point of this teaching. So remember the zeal that he displayed and
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:47.680]   then the joy that he talks of, the joy of sowing and the joy of reaping. It gladdens
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:54.440]   his heart. And whenever a soul is saved it gives him joy. And there is joy amongst the
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:45:01.600]   angels of heaven. And you and I are to be participators, he says, in this joy. And then
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:09.200]   finally remember his glorious and amazing condescension. This one who does not hesitate
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   to say, "I," in contradistinction to you. He is not only ready to talk to a woman, he
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:26.720]   is ready to talk to this fallen woman. This woman who is living in sin. And he allows
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:34.240]   her to speak to him and to put her fumbling questions and her clever arguments, all the
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:41.640]   infinite condescension of the Son of God. And he is still the same. He is the same blessed
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:49.280]   person. Don't let your weakness keep you from him. Don't let your sin keep you from
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:58.640]   him. Go to him. His heart is the temperest in the whole universe. So high and exalted
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:07.080]   and pure and apart from sin. He will never refuse you, he will never reject you. If you
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:15.760]   go to him penitent and repentant, humble and contrite, if you rarely seek his face, here
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:25.000]   he is, infinite in his glory, infinite in his condescension, infinite in his pity, his
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.200]   sympathy, his tenderness, and his readiness to deal with us. Well, there he is. He stands
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.720]   before the woman of Samaria and the disciples and later the Samaritans. But thank God he
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:51.040]   stands before us this morning. That's who he is. And that is what he is like, even now.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   Amen.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:47:05.000]   Now let us sing our closing hymn, hymn number 100, 100. Thou Son of God and Son of men,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   we love, adore, Emmanuel, hymn number 100.
