[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   Podcast listener Angel writes in, "Pastor John, I grew up as a Christian and I always
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.460]   planned to marry a good Christian man that brought me closer to God, held me accountable,
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.000]   and shared the same beliefs.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.120]   I'll skip all of the details on how I got to this point.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.180]   I ended up marrying someone that claimed to be a Christian but who lives a lifestyle contrary
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.920]   to the one founded on Christian values.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.480]   I'm at a loss.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.320]   He doesn't want a divorce and I don't want to live in sin.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.320]   I know Paul teaches that we are to stay with our unbelieving spouse, but were those God's
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.400]   words?
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.080]   I don't believe that divorce is pleasing to God, but I don't know that my marriage is
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080]   either."
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.880]   Pastor John, what would you say to Angel?
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.940]   Wow.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940]   This is huge.
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.320]   This has so many dimensions, and not to mention the sadness and the heaviness that's in that
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320]   sentence.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.080]   I'm not going to go into all the details.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:07.760]   So please, Angel, know that I've tasted enough trouble in marriage and I've listened to enough
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.600]   people with trouble that I don't make light of anything you've said here.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.560]   Everything I have to say, I say with a sense of gravity.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.560]   What should we say?
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.200]   It seems like at the heart, I mean, the first issue I've just got to deal with are her words,
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.040]   "I know Paul teaches that we are to stay with our unbelieving spouse, but were those God's
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.040]   words?"
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.200]   Now, I'm not sure what she's saying there, but I'm going to tackle a problem that she
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.040]   might be addressing, because in the passage of Scripture in 1 Corinthians 7, where Paul
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.600]   teaches on this, he says, "Not I but the Lord," in one case, and "I not the Lord," in another.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.320]   I wonder if Angel is wondering, is Paul just giving his opinion here, and these are not
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.320]   God's words?
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.760]   So let me read this and tackle that issue for just a few minutes.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:15.320]   It says in 1 Corinthians 7.10, "To the married I give this charge, 'Not I but the Lord.'"
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.640]   Not I but the Lord.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.880]   "The wife should not separate from her husband, but if she does, she should remain unmarried
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.080]   or else be reconciled to her husband, and the husband should not divorce his wife."
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.240]   And then he says, "To the rest," this is verse 12, "To the rest I say, 'I, not the Lord.'"
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.560]   And that's what I'm wondering she's asking about, that if any brother has a wife who
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.880]   is an unbeliever and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.400]   And if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her, she should
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.560]   not divorce him.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.960]   That's what she's referring to, and she wonders, are those God's words or just Paul's words?
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:07.240]   And I'm going to give four reasons why I believe they are God's words and Paul's words.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.760]   Number one, Paul was recognized as one of the authoritative apostles of the risen Lord
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.260]   to speak on his behalf in Galatians 2.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.840]   When they saw, Paul said, "That I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised,"
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.580]   just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised, for he who worked
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.100]   through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.500]   mine to the Gentiles.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.060]   Paul believed that he was, and others credited him as being, one of the authorized apostles
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.260]   to speak for the risen Christ.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:57.820]   Number two, at the end of this unit in 1 Corinthians 7, verse 40, I believe, Paul claims to have
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.780]   the Spirit of God in what he's teaching.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.900]   He says, "I think that I too have the Spirit of God."
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.380]   He's saying that over the whole chapter.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.020]   Number three, in chapter 14, verse 37, Paul writes with the incredible claim of authority
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.940]   of the Lord when he says, "If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, he should
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.740]   acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.740]   If anyone does not recognize, he is not recognized."
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.660]   So Paul has this enormous claim on the most practical issues to be speaking with the authority
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.140]   of Christ that even prophets should submit to.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.180]   The last point on this is regarding "I, not the Lord."
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.540]   Here's what he says.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:52.980]   So verse 10, "I, not the Lord," refers, I think, to the fact that in the one case, he
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:01.460]   has an actual explicit teaching from the historical Jesus as we have it in the Gospels, whereas
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.200]   in the second case, when he's talking about marriage to an unbeliever, he doesn't have
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.140]   any explicit teaching from the historical Jesus in the Gospels.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.980]   And so he's saying, "I'm rendering my apostolic authoritative judgment on that.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.680]   I don't have anything to quote from Jesus."
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.580]   So in Mark chapter 10, he has this, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.860]   adultery against her.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.020]   And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.020]   So Paul has a clear word.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.900]   Evidently, he had access to this tradition that was recorded in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:52.100]   But when it comes to, well, tell us whether that applies to being married to an unbeliever.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.060]   You can read all four Gospels and you won't find Jesus addressing that.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.580]   And so Paul, I think, is saying, "I, not the Lord," in the sense that the Lord has spoken
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.460]   in his historical life on this issue.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.900]   But he speaks, "If any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she consents to live
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.520]   with him, he should not divorce her.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.220]   If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he consents to live with her, she should
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.940]   not divorce him."
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.240]   So when she asked, "Did God say this?
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.080]   Is this God's will?"
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.740]   My answer is yes.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.700]   Now here's the one other thing I think we need to deal with in her question.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.180]   She writes, "He doesn't want divorce.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.240]   My husband doesn't want divorce.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.140]   And I don't want to live in sin."
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.300]   Oh, I wish I knew what she meant there.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.980]   I don't believe that divorce is pleasing to God, but I don't know that my marriage is
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.780]   either.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:58.660]   So I need to know what she means when she's saying, "I don't want to live in sin."
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.500]   So now I'm going to assume something.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   This is really important.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.140]   I'm going to assume that you are not talking about a case where your life or the life of
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.980]   your children is threatened or a situation where he may be beating you.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:20.180]   In that case, you should seek safety from your friends, a church, and you should bring
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.940]   in the authorities, church and civil, to restrain him.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.260]   So I'm going to assume that's not what she's talking about when she says that somehow she
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.700]   might be drawn into sin here.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:40.900]   So with regard to that general point, should she ever let herself be drawn into sin by
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.260]   somehow being a good wife?
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:52.380]   And my answer is 1 Peter 3, 1-6 makes it very clear that being a faithful, submissive Christian
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:08:00.700]   wife does not mean you should ever follow your husband into sin.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:09.020]   The whole point of that passage is that a woman has a new Lord, Jesus, above her husband,
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:16.780]   and she's trying to win her husband to join her in that allegiance to Jesus.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:26.960]   So if your husband is asking of you that you do things that are sinful, you should say
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:35.380]   to him humbly something like this, "I would love to follow your lead in this marriage,
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:43.140]   but when you ask me to do something that is sin, you're asking me to offend the one who
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.420]   has an even greater authority in my life than you have.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.100]   They need Jesus, and I cannot do it."
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:58.380]   I think that is a submissive way not to walk into sin.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.860]   She says, "I wonder if my marriage is pleasing to the Lord."
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:08.420]   And I would just say, and this might be the last thing we can tackle, I would just say
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.620]   that you should focus not on whether your marriage is pleasing to the Lord, but on whether
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.000]   you are.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.780]   So here are just a few encouragements.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:24.980]   Number one, 1 Peter 3, 1 to 6, addresses your situation exactly.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:31.940]   It gives guidance for you in trying to win a husband who does not obey the Word.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.580]   It doesn't answer every question.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.580]   I know that.
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.100]   It will leave questions unanswered.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.660]   But the Lord has given it to us, and it's a gift to us in marriage.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.840]   Second encouragement, the Lord promises to give you all the grace you need to be pleasing
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.100]   to Him yourself.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.460]   And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so having all sufficiency in all things,
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.620]   at all times you will abound in every good work.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:04.460]   2 Corinthians 9, 8, whatever your husband does, thinks, feels, God looks to you alone
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.940]   for whether you are walking in sin, not your husband.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:16.580]   Number three, marriage is a parable of covenant faithfulness, not covenant bliss.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:23.500]   Your faithfulness to your vows is pleasing to the Lord, no matter how much sadness is
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.940]   in your heart or in His heart.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.220]   It tells the truth.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.380]   This covenant keeping, your marriage is telling the truth about Christ and His church as a
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.700]   covenant keeping Christ and church.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:43.460]   And fourth, things can change, even after many years, yes, they can.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:50.220]   So now unto Him who is able to do far more abundantly than you ask or think according
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.220]   to the power at work within us.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:58.700]   So don't make your faithfulness depend on your husband's change, but do keep hoping
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.020]   and praying for it.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.580]   Keep knocking on the door of heaven.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.180]   And the last thing, last encouragement I would give is this, even if your marriage falls
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:16.540]   short of your hopes to the end, and which marriage doesn't, God will reward your faithfulness
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.740]   in the age to come a thousandfold.
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:25.060]   Whatever good anyone does, Ephesians 6, 8, whatever good anyone does, this he will receive
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.460]   back from the Lord.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:35.140]   Your husband and your friends may have no idea how many sacrifices you have made in
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:42.620]   order to love your husband as well as you can, but God knows every single one of them.
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.020]   And He says, "You will be repaid."
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:52.380]   All our trials are working for us in eternal weight of glory.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.300]   Beautiful Pastor John, that is wonderfully hope-filled counsel.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   Thank you.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.020]   Well, what is love exactly?
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.220]   Pastor John recently answered that question in episode 650, and tomorrow he will explain
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:11.100]   why God's love is a radical, counterintuitive love that you'll never get from Hollywood.
