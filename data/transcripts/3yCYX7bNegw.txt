[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740]   Where do you feel like things are
[00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.940]   in the world of points and miles?
[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.140]   What's happening now?
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.180]   - So I feel like most of the airlines have told people that,
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.180]   either intentionally or unintentionally,
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.980]   that they actually don't care if you fly them a lot.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.400]   They care more so how much money you spend with them.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.660]   So even if you look at your net,
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.660]   it's changed from like the old system to the current one.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.740]   It's very much contingent on you spending
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.980]   either a crap ton of money on your credit cards
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.420]   or flying a lot of them,
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.980]   but then it's not even economy flying.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.260]   You want like premium last minute business class type flying
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.620]   where you might be going to the airport
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.440]   and paying $1,000 for an SFO to LAX.
