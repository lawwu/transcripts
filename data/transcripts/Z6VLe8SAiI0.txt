[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   I asked some different women that I know, you know, if you could ask the world expert in
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.780]   exercise physiology, hormones, and nutrition, et cetera, as it relates to women, one question,
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.300]   what would it be? And one of the most common questions I got in the 50 and up category was,
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.560]   what is the most efficient way for a woman older than 50 to train for the maximum healthspan and
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.440]   lifespan benefits? I love this question because I get it all the time. We have to turn our brains
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.840]   away from everything that's been predicated before to this point. So if we're looking for longevity
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.700]   and we're looking at what we want to do when we're 80 or 90, we want to be independently living. We
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.500]   want to have good proprioception balance. We want to have good bones and we want to be strong. So this
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.420]   is where we look at 10 minutes, three times a week, jump training. So this isn't your landing softly in
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.540]   our knees. This is like impact in the skeletal system. A colleague and friend of mine, Tracy
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:11.640]   Klissel did a post, not a postdoc, but post research on this and is developing an app on it to show
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.080]   women how to jump to improve bone mineral density. Over the course of four months of this type of
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.500]   training, people have gone from being osteopenic to normal bone density. So it's a different type
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.940]   of stress. So if your concern is that, which a lot of women do have a concern because they lose about
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.840]   one third of their bone mass at the onset of menopause. Wow.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.460]   Yeah. Significant amount. One third?
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.820]   Yeah.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.100]   Goodness gracious.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.660]   If you don't do something as an intervention. So we see a lot of women are like, oh, I'm going to go
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:49.060]   on menopause hormone therapy to stop bone loss. Yeah, it can be a treatment, but I always look at an
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.660]   external stress that we can put on the body that's going to invoke a change without pharmaceuticals.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.180]   So jump training, heavy resistance training, and sprint interval training. Those are the three key
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.000]   things. And from a training standpoint, and then from a nutrition standpoint, getting protein. Protein
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.520]   is so important. When you start telling women, they need to look at around one to 1.1 grams per pound,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.120]   which is around that two to 2.3 grams per kilo per day. They're like, whoa, that's a lot of protein.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.400]   It is because we haven't been conditioned to eat it.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.020]   It's a few scrambled eggs. It's a chicken rest at lunch. It's a
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.580]   small steak at dinner. Plus other things.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.960]   Right. Exactly. And it doesn't all have to be animal products. I mean, you're looking at all
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.880]   the different beans and things that you can put together. And that's the other big thing that
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.660]   in order to build the muscle and to keep the body composition in the state that we want it to keep
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.400]   going for longevity, those are the big rocks. The sprint interval training, the heavy resistance
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.060]   training, the jump training, and the protein. I'm thinking about this. And I'm thinking about my
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.060]   mother who's 79 years old. She'll be 80 at the end of June and is in good health, walks a lot,
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.320]   gardens, does some yoga, but does none of the things that you're describing. So mom, please,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.340]   I'm going to send her to listen to this. I got my mom to switch.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:19.500]   In the same vein, what about the women out there age 20 to, maybe we make it the 20 to 40 bracket.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.540]   And if we need to divide that more finely, we can. What is the most efficient way for them to train
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.400]   for health, vigor, and longevity?
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.840]   Making things fun for the most part. I don't want people to think that it's a chore. So if you're
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.240]   someone who's been told you need to run and you hate running, then don't run. Like that's common
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:48.020]   sense. And I say that because I see little kids in non-US countries that have to run across country.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.640]   And you see these kids when they're six years old and all running around the field. And they're the
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.260]   kids that hate running that aren't natural runners. And then they hate physical activity for the rest of
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.480]   their life. So I put that in, like when you are exercising, you want to find something that you find
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.040]   fun. When you're in your twenties to forties, you have more room to get away with things that might
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.280]   not be optimal for you when you start to get older. Big rock again is resistance training. It doesn't
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.840]   have to be heavy resistance training. Like I said earlier to failure, you're periodizing. If you want
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.520]   to do a block of Olympic lifting, go for it. If you're like, I'm not comfortable doing that kind of
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.440]   lifting. I want to do more machine stuff. Great. But we want to make sure that you're changing it up all
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.940]   the time to keep things moving and shaking with regards to strength and hypertrophy.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.860]   And then it becomes more of, are you training for something that's endurance? Are you looking for
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.640]   just longevity for brain health? We need to have some lactate production because women, as I said,
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.380]   at the beginning of the podcast are more oxidative. We don't have as many of those glycolytic fibers.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.520]   So what we're finding in older research is that there's a misstep in brain lactate metabolism
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.020]   because the brain hasn't been exposed to it, especially for looking at women who are being
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.560]   studied now. It hasn't been in a societal context to do that kind of work. The younger we are and the
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.780]   more that we can keep our glycolytic fibers going by doing high intensity work, the more we're exposing
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.460]   our brain to lactate, the better we see fast forward to attenuating cognitive decline and reducing the
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.900]   plaque development of Alzheimer's. This is why women who are in their forties plus, I want them to do the
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.100]   sprint and the high intensity work for that lactate production. Start early because then you can
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.000]   take some of those type two B fibers that could either go more aerobic or anaerobic and make them
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.440]   more anaerobic. So those are the two big things for women who are younger. And then you can play around
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.980]   with the other things if you want to be an ultra endurance athlete. Yeah, not really ideal, but yeah,
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.060]   you can do that. That's fine. You'll recover well.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.960]   Now, forgive me because you've said it several times throughout today's discussion, but I really
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.940]   want to drive home a key point that I think for most people, men and women, is not obvious, but
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:12.120]   is really important. When you say high intensity, you don't mean a class or a run where you're drenched
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.460]   in sweat and gasping for air at the end necessarily. Let's disambiguate high intensity from what most people
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.500]   think of high intensity, which is a really hard workout, a tough class where they had me moving
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.420]   the whole time, doing a circuit, et cetera. What is the appropriate high intensity workout look like?
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:37.460]   Okay. So if I talk about true high intensity interval training, if you're a runner, it's going to the
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.040]   track and doing sets of 400 and 800s. Okay. So 400, a lap. Yep. 800, two laps.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:51.900]   Right. So you're looking at between a minute and four minutes of hard work at 80% or more
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.860]   with variable recovery. So that's why I use a track as an example. So if you do one lap and you're like,
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.720]   oh, I'm going to walk half a lap and then do it again, that's adequate recovery.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.020]   Very tough. Yeah. It's hard. Right. But it's not like you're going to be there for 90 minutes doing
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.140]   as many 400s as you can. Because you have that variable recovery, it might take a half an hour
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.680]   to 40 minutes max. And then you're gassed out. You can't do it anymore. If you're looking at a gym
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:23.380]   gym situation, I like to look at something like every minute on the minute, where you might be
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:31.020]   doing 10 deadlifts at moderate intensity weight. And it takes- 10 repetitions. Yeah. So it takes you
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.880]   50 seconds to complete that. Then you have 10 seconds to move to the next exercise that might be
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.680]   thrusters. So a squat, clean thruster. So it's a squat pulling the weight up overhead. So you're doing
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.640]   maybe eight of those in that minute and you might have 10 second recovery. You go to the next exercise
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:55.900]   that might be kettlebell swings and you're doing explosive kettlebell swings and you'll finish,
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.040]   you know, 10 seconds to go. You go to the fourth exercise, I don't know, toes to bar or some other
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:08.120]   kind of V-up, some other high intensity. And then you have one minute completely off. So you've had four
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.000]   minutes of really heavy work with maybe 10 seconds to move to the next exercise.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.520]   One minute completely off. And then you repeat that three times.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.920]   And this is high intensity interval training. This is not what you would consider resistance training
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.640]   for sake of building muscle or strength. Correct. You're using these loads, these machines, the,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.100]   the pike, you know, hanging from the bar and bringing your knees up or L-sit or something as
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.780]   a tool to get the heart rate up continually. Yep. Yep.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.720]   Very different than resistance training the way most people think about it. Correct. So this is the
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.380]   cardiovascular high intensity interval training. And the subset of that is sprint interval
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.840]   training. And this is something that's really, really hard and people don't get it. I don't
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:53.320]   necessarily mean running. It can be whatever mode of activity, but it's 30 seconds or less as hard
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   as you can go. So this is your nine or 10 on your rating and perceived exertion, 110%. It's max effort.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.800]   On the rower, on the airdyne bike. Yeah. Running if you like. Yeah. Okay. Any of those things. The skier.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:12.200]   Yeah. Battle ropes. Battle ropes are big. So 30 seconds all out, then rest, what, 10, 15 seconds?
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.580]   Repeat? No. No. You want to, because now we're looking at that top end where we want
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:25.740]   regeneration of your ATP, you know, all of that system and central nervous system recovery. So this
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.660]   is 30 seconds all out. It could be two or three minutes of recovery. Oh, nice. Because I'm not
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.300]   looking at Tabata where you're 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off, because that's not the intensity we
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:42.180]   want. We want you to go all out and recover well enough to be able to go all out again. You're not
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:48.720]   leaving anything in the tank. So those are what I mean by high intensity interval training, or when
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.480]   you're looking at polarizing your cardiovascular work, that's the top end. Those are the two examples
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:59.920]   of your top end. And then your recovery is that long, slow walking on another day where you're not
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.440]   going and doing a tempo run. You're not doing a 5K easy jog because that puts you in that modern intensity.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:11.940]   And if I heard you correctly earlier, you are suggesting most women do one or two days of high
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:18.700]   intensity interval training plus three to four days of resistance training for sake of building strength
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:26.460]   and muscle, which looks very different. It's more warm up, do a couple work sets, you know, two to four
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:32.920]   work sets of, you know, an overhead press, two or four work sets of maybe a barbell curl, two or four sets of
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.900]   some dips or whatever, whatever, um, one's, you know, personal choices. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:46.280]   Okay. Got it. Um, very different, far and away different than what most people, men or women are
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:53.760]   doing out there, which is, um, a lot of Stairmaster treadmill jogging, maybe some lifting for hypertrophy.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.100]   Because I look at the general consensus of what's out there in the fitness world is all based on
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:05.400]   aesthetics and body composition. So people have this mentality of, I need to be hypertrophy to get
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.220]   swole and I need to do long, slow stuff on the cardio machine to lose body fat. But that isn't what
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:19.880]   we're after. We're after let's create really strong external stress to create adaptations, not only from
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:26.140]   a neural and a brain standpoint, that's understanding it, but also feeding down to metabolic change.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:33.140]   .
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.200]   you
