[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Touching on creatine, it is the most tested, safe, and effective support supplement we have.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.520]   I mean, it's just, there are thousands of studies on creatine monohydrate now.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.680]   And I would say very clearly too, if you're using any other form of creatine, I think you're
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.160]   wasting your money. Creatine hydrochloride has some hype around it. Apparently, it's a little
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.180]   more soluble. The claim is that you need less, but there's only a couple studies on it, and it's
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.000]   more expensive. And creatine monohydrate is not particularly expensive. I realize people have
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.520]   different budgets, but it's not, it doesn't land in the, it's not a budget breaker. Yeah, it's gotten
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.460]   more expensive because of COVID and supply chain issues. Even the, there's forms of creatine that
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.700]   appear to be as good, like hydrochloride, but it's more expensive. And then things like creatine ethyl
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.920]   ester has been shown to be worse than creatine monohydrate. Buffered creatine is as good or
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.560]   worse, and it's much more expensive. So I tell people just take creatine monohydrate. It is tried
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.700]   and true. It's been shown to saturate the muscle cells 100% with phosphocreatine, and that's what
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.680]   you want. So creatine works through a few different methodologies. One, through increasing phosphocreatine
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.420]   content, which helps improve exercise performance. It also appears to improve recovery, and it
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.220]   increases lean mass, a lot of which is through bringing water into the muscle cells. But that
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.440]   is, I mean, muscle cells are mostly water. So when people say, well, it's just water, that's
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:47.020]   what muscle cells mostly are. And it also increases strength and some other metrics. Now, it also has
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.160]   been shown in studies that people tend to get a decrease in body fat percentage. Now that's probably
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.280]   because they're getting an increase in lean mass. And so the relative is a decrease in body fat
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.700]   percentage. But there are a few studies that show a decrease in fat mass as well. I don't think that
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.100]   creatine is a fat burner. I think that people are able to train harder, build more lean tissue. And so
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.680]   that's probably having an effect on fat mass. Then they've actually shown more recently some
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.320]   cognitive benefits to creatine, which I find really interesting as well. But the only knock on creatine
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.140]   that anybody's been able to come up with, because they've debunked the kidney stuff, they've debunked
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.060]   the liver stuff, there's no evidence that it harms healthy kidney or liver, is hair loss. So what about
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.160]   hair loss? Because there was one study in 2009 that showed that creatine increased DHT.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.240]   But they didn't really show an effect on any other sex hormone. So it's kind of strange. Like you would
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.420]   think if there was an increase in DHT, there would be like something else that changes as well.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.540]   And it's only one study. And again, didn't directly measure hair loss, measured DHT, which we know is
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.980]   involved in the loss of the follicle. So what I would say is that I am not convinced. It's only one study,
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.220]   never been replicated to my knowledge, and it was looking at a mechanism rather than an outcome. So if you're
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.340]   somebody who's prone to hair loss, and you want to avoid creatine because of that, I understand. But for most
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.820]   people, I don't think it's a, I don't think it's something to worry about.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.300]   Do you emphasize the classic loading of creatine, taking it a bunch of times per day, and then backing off or just
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.540]   taking it consistently at the, I think five grams per day is kind of a typical dose that people take?
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.060]   So again, no solutions, only trade-offs. You can load it and you will saturate your
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.700]   phosphocreatine stores faster, like usually within a week. If you just take five grams per day,
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.660]   it'll take two, three, four weeks, but you will get to the same place. And you're probably going to have
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.740]   a much lower risk of GI issues. Some people, creatine can be a gut irritant. If it is for some folks,
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.780]   I would recommend splitting it into multiple doses. So maybe like multiple to one or two gram doses per
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:10.980]   day. And definitely don't load it if you're somebody who has GI issues from it.
