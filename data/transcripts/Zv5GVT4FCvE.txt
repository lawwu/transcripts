[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.240]   All right, but let's do a deep dive.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.040]   So I wanted to talk about this topic of tips for doing hard things.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.360]   And what's going to be different about this deep dive versus past deep dives
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.080]   is I'm not giving my advice for doing hard things.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.800]   I actually want to relay some advice that I saw in an interesting video that a
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.240]   reader sent to me from 2020 of an author giving a talk about this topic.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.160]   And I recently wrote an essay about this talk and I published it in my email
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.080]   newsletter, which if you don't get, you probably should.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.760]   You can sign up for that at calnewport.com.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.040]   But I figured I just wrote that this morning before we started recording.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.560]   I said, I want to talk about this on the show.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.240]   So I brought in some of my notes from it.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.360]   So here's the setup.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.440]   The video is from 2020.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.560]   It's from the fantasy novelist, Brandon Sanderson,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.120]   who wrote a bunch of best-selling series.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.560]   I've read some of his books.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.560]   I read Name of the Wind and whatever the second book was in that particular trilogy.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.680]   And it's really good.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.520]   And I'm actually now one of the books I'm reading right now is I decided I wanted to
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240]   read some Ursula K.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.640]   Gwynne.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.880]   And I was going back and reading some of her Earthsea Chronicles, which has,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.800]   that's from the 60s, but it has some ideas about the true names of elements being
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.000]   critical to the magical system that Sanderson plays with.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.800]   Anyways, think big, successful fantasy novelist.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.760]   And he gives a talk in 2020 that was titled, let me have it here, The Common Lies Writers
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.000]   Tell You.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.160]   But this was not really what the talk was about.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.080]   The talk was about doing hard things.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.240]   And Sanderson comes right out.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.560]   And you know I'm going to appreciate this.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.160]   He comes right out up front and says he dislikes the fact that the media keeps telling young
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.520]   people that you can do anything you want to and you should follow your dreams.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.200]   And he said, look, that is way too simplistic.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.400]   That's not the way it works.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.720]   That's not going to help anyone to say that.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.080]   It's definitely a perspective you would hear, for example, in my book, So Good They Can't
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.480]   Ignore You.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.360]   And he says, OK, here is the more realistic claim.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.120]   And I'm quoting him here.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.200]   I can do hard things.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.240]   Doing hard things has intrinsic value.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.040]   And they will make me a better person, even if I end up failing.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.920]   He said, that's the right way to talk about ambitious goals, is there's value in doing
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.480]   hard things.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.920]   You are able to do hard things.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.600]   And you're going to get value out of it, no matter what actually happens, whether it makes
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.160]   you a famous novelist or not, or whatever that dream happens to be.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.320]   And that this is better than telling people, no, of course you'll succeed.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.280]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.000]   And then for the remainder of his talk, he said, so let's talk about doing hard things.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.120]   And he gave three tips, three tips for the reality, reality-based tips for dealing with
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.920]   hard things.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.600]   So I thought what I would do here is I want to go through these three tips.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.400]   I'll tell you what he said, and then give a little bit of my own commentary on each.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.240]   So the first tip he gave was make better goals.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.000]   So when it comes to doing hard things, he thinks we are not good at setting the right
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.320]   goals.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.480]   We don't help people set better goals.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.080]   So he mentioned, for example, that in an AP literature class in high school, he won a
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.000]   minor contest for a story he wrote and decided, oh, my goal is to be a successful novelist.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.840]   And he said that was not a good goal.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.720]   It was way too long-term, vague, and grandiose.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.560]   How do you make progress on that particular goal?
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.320]   In particular, what are you supposed to do tomorrow to make progress towards that goal
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.640]   and become a successful writer?
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.000]   He said what you should do instead is make goals that you have control over.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.200]   And what Sanderson ended up doing was writing 13 manuscripts before he actually had a book
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.920]   he could sold.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.240]   And he said his goal should have been focused on producing a certain number of manuscripts
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.200]   as an act of practice and having a commitment with each manuscript to be more ambitious
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.560]   than the last to push and develop his skills, because that's a goal he could make progress
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.800]   on.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.200]   I could write another manuscript.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.640]   I can for sure make this next manuscript be even more ambitious in this way, this way,
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.960]   that way.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.160]   Those are achievable goals.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.960]   Saying be a successful author, that was too vague.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.480]   All right.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.960]   Now, my take on this is I write about something similar in my book, Deep Work.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.200]   In that book, Deep Work, I talk about this methodology, this business methodology called
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.360]   4DX, the four disciplines of execution.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.120]   And I talk about how this methodology, which was designed to help teams and companies do
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.240]   better, gives us some insight into accomplishment when we apply it to individuals.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.360]   And one of the core ideas from that methodology is lead versus lag indicators.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.400]   A lag indicator is the big goal you eventually want to accomplish.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.200]   I want my next academic paper to get into a top tier journal.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.120]   The problem with lag indicators, according to 4DX, is that it doesn't give you a clear
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.520]   action.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.160]   So they said instead, you should focus on what they call lead indicators, which are
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.680]   things you can track and do in control.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.440]   And they should be chosen such that if you do well with those lead indicators, you're
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.040]   likely to have success with the lag indicators, but it gives you something concrete to focus
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.440]   on.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.720]   And so for that example, the right lead indicator might be, I'm going to do 15 hours of
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.400]   deep work per week on the paper I'm writing.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.080]   Well, that I can track.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.280]   That creates friction I can push back against.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.400]   Now I can actually make real changes in the intentional application of my energy, cancel
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.280]   things, move things, wake up early, progress can happen.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.840]   So I like Sanderson's idea there, and I've talked about variations of that.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.040]   All right, his second tip.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.720]   Learn how you work.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:17.200]   So Sanderson, when it comes to writing, thinks it's a real disservice when he hears people
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.840]   say things like, "Real writers have an overwhelming compulsion to write."
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.160]   And that if you don't have that compulsion, you should do anything else.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.760]   And only people who just can't help but write, and that's all they can do, should be people
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.800]   who should be writers.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   He thinks that's nonsense.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.320]   He says, "Writing is hard, and it's hard work to figure out how to get yourself to do it."
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.520]   He is a professional writer, and I'm quoting him here.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.920]   "I love writing, but I have a hard time sitting down and writing."
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.320]   So even for this very successful professional writer, he says, "Writing is hard."
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.280]   So his advice is, when it comes to doing hard things, you have to put in a lot of effort
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.640]   to figure out what works for you to basically get yourself to do that type of effort.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   And it could differ from person to person.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.040]   Sanderson uses daily word count tracking in a spreadsheet.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.080]   It's like a game for him.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.640]   He likes that.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.680]   But he says, "Other people thrive under the social pressure of a writer's group.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.120]   Other people need a deadline."
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.880]   Now, I talk about this a lot in my own work.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.160]   I talk a lot about how deep, cognitively demanding efforts are unnatural.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.000]   It uses a lot of energy.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.240]   More ancient parts of our brain cannot immediately see what benefit they're going to get from this
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.720]   energy.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.480]   What's the threat we're escaping?
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.960]   Where's the food or mate source that this thinking is going to give us right away?
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.480]   And it doesn't have an answer for that.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:49.040]   You try to convince your brain, for example, that your 460,000-word epic fantasy novel is
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.560]   going to help you in mate selection.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.320]   Your brain's not going to buy it.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.240]   It's going to see that you're talking a lot about wizards with names like Gargamel, who
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.760]   are passing wind spells on elves.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.120]   And it's going to say, "This is not going to get us children.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.640]   This is not going to get us food.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.400]   Why are we doing this?"
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.760]   And this is generally true when it comes to doing cognitively demanding work.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.560]   It's unnatural.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.480]   So a lot of effort is required to trick yourself into doing it.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.080]   So I like what Sanderson talked about.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.520]   I would also add scheduling philosophy and ritual.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.120]   That's why this plays such a big role.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.360]   Get rid of any decision your mind has about when you're going to do this work.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.120]   Instead, you have a philosophy.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.960]   It's always these days at these times.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.560]   Or at the beginning of the week, I put it on my calendar, and it's right there in the
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.680]   same color as meetings I know I can't skip.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.800]   That time is protected.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.480]   I don't always feel like I want to go to a meeting, but if it's on my calendar, I'd go.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.160]   I don't always feel like I want to write, but it's there on my calendar.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.280]   That's what I'm doing next.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.080]   And this is also why ritual matters.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.720]   Writers will build out these spaces that seem over the top or go to weird places, like I
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.560]   wrote about in my New Yorker piece last summer about working from near home, where writers
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.840]   will leave perfectly nice and good homes to go to weird, eccentric locations to write
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.320]   just because they associate that transit.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.040]   They associate that new environment just with writing.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:20.400]   That's why Peter Benchley left his bucolic carriage home on East Welland Avenue there.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.320]   Actually, no, he's on Curliss Avenue.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.880]   Curliss Avenue there in Pennington, New Jersey, to work in the back room of a furnace factory.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.280]   That's why Steinbeck would balance a legal pad on a boat in Sag Harbor.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.800]   It's why Maya Angelou would go to hotel rooms and take everything off the walls.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.160]   So there is zero distraction.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.400]   And Wright laying down on the bed, propped up on an arm, doing this so often that she
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.960]   built up deep calluses on that arm that she was supporting herself.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.640]   Because it's hard to do this work.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.280]   You've got to figure out how to get your mind into there.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:57.120]   So scheduling philosophies and rituals, especially over-the-top rituals, play a big role.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.800]   And I'll say when it comes to writing, there's a quote I've said a few times, has bounced
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   around a few times, which is basically what some people call writer's block.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.880]   By some people, I mean amateurs.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.400]   It's actually just the physiological feeling of what writing, the writing experience is.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.680]   That feeling of, I don't know what to say.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.680]   I don't feel inspired.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.960]   I don't know what to say.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.080]   I'm stuck.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.920]   It's like, great, now you've started writing.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.800]   That's what it feels like.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.600]   All right, Sanderson's third tip, break it down.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.960]   Maybe his most prosaic tip out of the three.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.720]   But basically, if you have a big goal, break it into manageable pieces so you have something
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.440]   to go after.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:40.160]   He noted that the book he was writing at that time was longer than the entire Hunger Games
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.040]   series put together.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:49.600]   So he's saying that's such a big, hairy, epic goal because he'll write 400,000 word plus
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.960]   books, which is crazy.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.760]   By comparison, my books are usually 70,000 to 90,000.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.800]   So it's like five deep works.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.880]   He's like, you've got to break that down.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.960]   That can't be your goal.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.000]   I'm writing this book.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.200]   It's no, no, I'm trying to finish the chapter cycle that establishes the backstory for
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.160]   the wizard Gargamel that passes the wind spells on the elves, or whatever it is.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.760]   I obviously know a lot about fantasy books.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.520]   So I think that's good work.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.600]   I think the key part about this final tip is that he says in figuring out what those
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:33.280]   goals are, that's where all the magic happens, is that we don't give people enough training,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.400]   especially in creative fields, to figure out what those smaller goals are.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.120]   He said this is a particular problem in writing, where if you talk to a professional writer
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.840]   and say, look, I really want to do what you do, what's your advice?
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   They'll just look at you and say, well, you got to write.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.320]   He says, that's too vague.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.520]   No, no, what you need to tell me is it's going to take about six manuscripts before you get
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.160]   your chops down.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.040]   And those manuscripts have to be successively harder in this way.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.720]   And here is the level, type, and source of feedback you need on each to make sure that
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.000]   you're gaining particular skills.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.640]   You do one on your own, you do one with two with a writing group, for the fourth, maybe
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.200]   you want to hire an editor a day of their time to come back and give you a harsher,
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.280]   the fifth you want to submit and get notes from the publisher that you submit to.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.280]   We need that type of detailed roadmap.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.960]   It's non-trivial and it's non-obvious.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.720]   You don't just tell people, if you want to write, write.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   If you want to be a musician, play music.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.080]   You want to be an artist, paint.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.600]   No, these are big, hairy goals that you need to break down, and it's not obvious how they
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.160]   break down.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:35.280]   And the thing I talk about a lot on this show in particular is that if you're going to get
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.760]   this information, you have to go get it.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.600]   And by what I mean by that is you have to go to people who know what they're doing.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.120]   And don't just say, what's your advice?
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.560]   Because they'll just say, write.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.520]   They'll just say, paint.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.160]   Say, I want to hear your story.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.880]   How did you get there?
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.600]   What was the first thing?
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.480]   Then what was the next thing?
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.360]   Oh, oh, Sanderson, you wrote 13 manuscripts?
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.400]   Oh, I didn't realize that.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.200]   So you mean I can't just do National Novel Writing Month and have the name of the win
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.320]   be the book that comes out of it?
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.680]   Oh, OK, now I get that.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.200]   I don't like that that's reality, but that's reality.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.320]   OK, I have to write 13 manuscripts.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.520]   How long is that going to take?
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.000]   You know, maybe I'm going to need much more time on this than I think.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.240]   You get the reality, not what you want to be true.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.360]   You get the reality of what actually matters for the endeavor you want to do.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.600]   You get that reality from people who came before, not by asking for advice, but asking
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.440]   for their story.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.040]   You look at that, and you find out what really matters.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.920]   I talked about this.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.560]   If you want to see a more extensive conversation about this, when I was on the Tim Ferriss
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:36.720]   podcast earlier in-- whenever this was, January, I guess I was on his podcast-- we get into
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.240]   how I got started in writing.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:44.000]   They go into detail of the story about how, through connections with my family, I got
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.400]   in touch with an agent, a literary agent, who I promised, I'm not going to try to sell
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:48.880]   you a book.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.480]   And I had that agent walk me through step by step what exactly would a 20-year-old need
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.560]   to do to get a book deal with a major publisher.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.600]   And she walked me through, here's what matters, here's what doesn't, here's the process,
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.320]   here's the steps.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.320]   And it was not at all what I would have guessed, and it's not at all what most young people
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.840]   I've met who say, I want to write a book do, but it was the reality.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:14.000]   And it took me two years, but I followed that plan and sold that book and wrote that book
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.240]   as a senior, and everything else unfolded from there.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.000]   So that's my advice there is, yes, you need to break down your goals, the more manageable
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.400]   goals.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.800]   It's not always obvious how to do that.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.120]   Ask the experts, but not for their advice, but for their story, and you can extract from
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.160]   their story the reality of what matters.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.880]   All right, so Sanderson, thank you for giving that talk.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.440]   Excuse me for my wizard elf jokes.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.800]   Obviously, you're very good at what you do, and I am of great awe, but that's good advice.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.200]   Don't just follow your dreams.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.160]   Focus on doing hard things for the meaning of doing hard things, and treat doing hard
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:15:04.400]   things like a complicated endeavor that requires a lot of nuanced feedback.
