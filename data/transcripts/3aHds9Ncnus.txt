[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700]   One concept I have for food that really helps me is really thinking about the body's always
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.160]   trying to help me be satiated and trying to help reduce my cravings.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.960]   I literally just have to give the body what it needs.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.560]   I have to stimulate the body in a way that it will serve me in giving me satiety hormones
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.360]   to basically regulate my hunger.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.440]   And again, with visuals I think it's so helpful.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.200]   I think about these cells lining our small intestine that literally have nutrient sensors
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.960]   and literal receptors on the cell membrane in the luminal side of the gut that's facing
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   all the food that are just sitting there waiting to bind with these things in our food that
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.760]   will stimulate the cell to make the satiety hormone that poof, effortlessly makes us not
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.760]   hungry, gets rid of that grip of attachment to cravings that all of us are so plagued
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760]   by.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.400]   And I think we have this intense conversation happening in society right now about GLP-1
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.680]   analogs and Ozempic and Menjara and all these things, GLP-1 agonists, but we rarely talk
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.800]   about the fact that we have nutrient sensing cells of the gut, the L cells of the gut,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.220]   that when stimulated appropriately will make GLP-1.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.640]   And when stimulated the way they want to be will secrete hordes of GLP-1 for us.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.560]   And so how do we actually think about just literally giving the body what it needs to
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.040]   stimulate the satiety hormones?
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.920]   And the processed foods aren't giving us those things.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.360]   You know, the things that are going to stimulate those cells – well, the things that will
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.320]   – I mean, this is kind of fascinating if you don't mind going down a little road.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.320]   No, please.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.320]   Please.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.640]   With the GLP-1 conversation, I feel like so missing from the conversation is the idea
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   that like from a first principles perspective, there's three ways our body could make more
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.800]   GLP-1.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.000]   We make more cells that make it, L cells of the gut.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.480]   Each of those cells makes more GLP-1, and importantly, we can also inhibit the inactivator
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.380]   of GLP-1, which is an enzyme called DPP-4.
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.060]   So GLP-1 actually gets rapidly degraded by DPP-4 in the body.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.360]   So if we can figure out how to inhibit DPP-4, we can raise our GLP-1 levels.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360]   What is DPP-4?
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.920]   It's an enzyme that breaks down GLP-1 rapidly.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920]   Got it.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.920]   Thanks.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   I apologize.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   It's so fascinating.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.080]   So how often have you seen in the headlines, "Oh, here's some strategies to inhibit
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   your DPP-4."
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.960]   Never, because Ozempic is on track to be the highest grossing med in human history, and
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.480]   just like we talked about in the beginning of the episode, the whole industry, this $4
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.320]   trillion healthcare industry, is desperate for us to not understand how to do the things
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.000]   that drugs could do for us.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.480]   So when we look at those three first principles approaches of how do we make more L cells,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.120]   get them to produce more GLP-1 from each L cell, and then inhibit the breakdown through
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.400]   the inhibition of DPP-4, for the first one, we know that short-chain fatty acids, which
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.980]   of course are the byproduct of microbial fermentation of fiber in the diet, stimulates the differentiation
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.400]   of more L cells in the gut.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.840]   So more short-chain fatty acids, more L cells.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.620]   Can we translate that into support the gut microbiome?
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.620]   Eat more fiber.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.620]   Eat more fiber.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.080]   And we had Justin Sonnenberg from Stanford on, a world expert in gut microbiome, and
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.280]   he was a big proponent of, based on work he's done with Chris Gardner and others at Stanford,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.040]   so happens, of ingesting one to three servings of low-sugar fermented foods each day.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.600]   Things like sauerkraut, kimchi, again, low-sugar variety is probably best.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   Right.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   Not kombucha.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   Maybe not.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.600]   You said not kombucha?
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   'Cause that's gonna be like the highest sugar of the fermented foods, which people often
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   go to, but now that's become soda.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   And often costly too.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   And pretty costly.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   I love sauerkraut.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.240]   Tim Ferriss had a great recipe for this in "The 4-Hour Chef."
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.640]   You have to be careful because you can create some unhealthy ferment.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.960]   You have to do it the way he describes.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.200]   So check out the recipe.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   It's online.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.680]   Or you can buy sauerkraut and the brines, drinking the brine off the sauerkraut, seems
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.280]   to be good for the gut.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.240]   That's such a great point, which is that ultimately we want the short-chain fatty acids, which
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.840]   is the medicine that the microbiome are making for us through the microbial fermentation
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   process.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.960]   And we can basically do that in three ways.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.920]   One is we can eat more fiber, which is prebiotics.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.880]   We can also eat more polyphenols because we're now learning that the microbiome actually processes,
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.060]   they ferment polyphenols from our, which is basically you'll find those in colorful fruits
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.080]   and vegetables, spices, teas, cocoa, things like that.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.040]   So fermentation of polyphenols and fiber to short-chain fatty acids, which then we absorb.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.360]   And then, like you just said, in a fermented food, the bacteria in that food will be making
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.960]   short-chain fatty acids by fermenting the food in there.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.740]   And then if we drink that, we're getting the short-chain fatty acids directly.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.400]   So that's the kimchi, sauerkraut, Greek yogurt, kvass, which I'm obsessed with, which is like
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.800]   low-sugar kombucha.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.760]   It's like made with fermenting beets, basically.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   That's good stuff.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   It's such good stuff.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Miso, natto.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.080]   So that's one.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.040]   That has been shown to differentiate more L cells in the gut.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.560]   We also know that people with type 2 diabetes have much fewer L cells in the gut.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.080]   And it's hard to know what the causality is there, but I think a safe assumption is like
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.920]   if we keep our blood sugar under better control and sort of stay out of that diabetic range,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   it probably lends itself.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.680]   I don't know what the chicken and the egg is there, but blood sugar stability, more L
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   cell differentiation.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.480]   And then actually, ginseng has been shown to improve L cell differentiation.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.880]   So that's just sort of one set of things.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.960]   And I don't think the dose on ginseng has been settled, but very high antioxidant component
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   plant.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.160]   When we look at actually stimulating more GLP-1, you've talked about your Ramate, I
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.320]   think, having like a mild effect on GLP-1, but there's actually a lot of other things
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   in the literature.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.680]   Protein, of course, very potently stimulates these nutrient receptor cells and specifically
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.400]   like valine and glutamine seem to have a potent stimulatory effect on GLP-1.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.680]   So you're gonna find that in like meat and turkey and eggs and things like that.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.280]   What are your thoughts on supplementing L-glutamine?
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   It's controversial.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.980]   I know that some people do it in an effort to relieve leaky gut, but there aren't any
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.820]   randomized control trials for that.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:36.240]   So depending on one stance on what's required for kind of a threshold for adopting something,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.600]   some people will say that's crazy.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.480]   Other people really swear by supplementing L-glutamine.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.760]   Maybe it's through this route of increasing L-cells that some of the gut relief might
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.760]   exist.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.920]   I guess we'd have to explore it.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.320]   So that's speculative, folks.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.080]   So this is interesting.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.080]   These are ways to increase the cells that then make GLP-1.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.720]   So fiber, prebiotic, probiotic fiber, and fermented foods.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.420]   Antioxidants, lowering blood sugar, ginseng.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.400]   So those are kind of the L-cell ones.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.580]   The actual secretion of more GLP-1, one of the most potent ones and the study that looks
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.720]   at this, like the bar graphs are very clearly statistically significant, lots of asterisks,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   is actually thylakoids.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720]   Thylakoids.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   Tell me more about thylakoids.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   Thylakoids are so fascinating.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.520]   Thylakoids are actually a structure in plants that are part of the chloroplasts.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.400]   So chloroplasts, and this also is fascinating because chloroplasts are basically the plant
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.560]   version of mitochondria, essentially.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.280]   And thylakoids are a molecule in the chloroplasts.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.840]   And there's actually been research that shows that when you eat about 100 grams of spinach,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:49.760]   which gives you 5 grams of straight thylakoid over 12 weeks daily, it led to a significant
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   increase in GLP-1.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:58.620]   And again, I don't remember the exact, it was two or three-fold higher secretion.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.040]   So that's a direct stimulatory effect of the L-cells.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.760]   And so this equates to 3.5 ounces of spinach a day, which is like nothing.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   So just getting those...
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.760]   Raw spinach or cooked spinach?
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.040]   I don't think it actually...
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.400]   It might have said in the methods, but I would imagine raw because you want to get those
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.600]   undenatured thylakoids in the gut.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.760]   So just kind of another...
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.840]   Actually thylakoids do a lot of other interesting stuff.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.920]   They inhibit lipase in the gut and so actually help more fat get down to the distal small
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.480]   bowel and promote satiety.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.360]   So this is one of the reasons why you talk about, oh, the people who eat all these healthy
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.000]   foods and greens, they're less hungry.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.920]   It's like, it's biochemistry.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.860]   There's stuff happening in there that is making the hunger signals go down through things
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.320]   like inhibiting lipase, improving GLP-1 secretion.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.200]   So other things for GLP-1 secretion, the thylakoids, also fiber has been shown, specific amino acids,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.320]   so high-protein foods, things that involve a lot of valine and glutamine, green tea,
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:07.120]   and specifically the ECGC that is one of the compounds in green tea, that's been shown
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.440]   to stimulate GLP-1, curcumin.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.080]   So there's several things that are all in that whole food, basically things you would
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.440]   associate with a healthy diet, but we actually know they stimulate GLP-1.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.720]   So those are all things I try to include in my diet.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.160]   And the last one is inhibition of DPP-4.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.480]   And that one, there's just actually, when you look at the research, there's some kind
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:34.800]   of random foods that tend to inhibit DPP-4, black beans, Mexican oregano, other forms
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.440]   of oregano, rosemary, guava, and I wrote this one down because it's a word I hadn't seen
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.280]   very much before I started digging into this, but muricetin, which is found in berries,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.120]   cranberries, and peppers, and Swiss chard.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:56.040]   So all that is to say, ultimately, many of us are gripped by cravings.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:05.000]   And the idea of just not being constantly driven to eat more, which I would argue that
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.020]   about 80% of Americans are, feels really hard to overcome.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:15.240]   But a lot of it is literally just communicating to your cells in a clear way through food
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.520]   to help you be satiated.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.600]   And the science can show us how to do this.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.720]   And a lot of it comes down to eating, essentially, what you were talking about, how you eat,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:35.240]   protein, healthy sources with nutrient density, and lots of colorful fruits, vegetables, spices,
