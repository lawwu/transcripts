[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160]   A podcast listener named Steve writes in to ask a very pointed question, and it's this.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.360]   Pastor John, are some people predestined for hell?
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:28.080]   Before I give my clear and definite answer, it really is crucial that a few preliminary
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.200]   things be said that are always lurking right there below the surface, ready to turn the
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.160]   answer into something it's not.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.440]   So here's some preliminaries and then a few Bible verses and an answer.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.640]   There are many people for whom a yes answer to this question, yes, he predestines people
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.400]   to hell, would have to mean God is unjust and he's not good.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.680]   So a positive answer to that question is simply not possible for them.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:12.840]   In fact, I would say if that is who you are, if God's predestining who is saved and who
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.940]   perishes can only mean that he's unrighteous or unjust or not good, you shouldn't believe
[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.680]   it, even if it's true.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.660]   I know that sounds strange.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:36.800]   Only believe it if you see it taught in the Bible and if it does not undermine other true
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.440]   and important things taught about God in the Bible.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   I know that sounds almost outrageous to people to say, "Don't believe it even if it's true,"
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.040]   but I'm not eager to undermine anyone's confidence in the goodness and the justice of God.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.720]   And I know what it's like to see these things at first and not see how they fit with his
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.040]   justice and goodness.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.320]   And I have wept.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:14.920]   I mean, my early 20s was a season of great torment mentally and emotionally over theological
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.620]   issues like this.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.400]   I have tasted what it means to put my head on my desk, face in my hands and cry out to
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   God.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.800]   "Get this!"
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.120]   So I want to be patient with people.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.280]   I don't want to undermine anyone's confidence in the righteousness and the goodness of God.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.360]   That's my first preliminary.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.680]   A second preliminary thing would be that God never, never, never sends, never will send
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.200]   anyone to hell unjustly.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.640]   No one will ever be in hell who does not deserve to be there.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.000]   And this fact that they deserve to be there will be open and plain in all the universe
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.320]   in that day.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.760]   Third preliminary.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.940]   This means that if God ordains ahead of time that anyone will perish, he does it in a way
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.200]   which is probably inscrutable to us and beyond our understanding.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.400]   He does it in a way that the person is really responsible, really accountable for his choices,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.680]   really guilty, really deserving of punishment.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.280]   That's the hardest thing to grasp.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.520]   But it is essential if we're going to believe all of scripture, I believe.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.400]   Everyone who perishes has chosen sin in such a way as to be truly responsible for his choice
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.600]   and truly guilty and truly deserving of judgment.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.960]   That's preliminary number three.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.080]   And here's the last preliminary.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.040]   We live in a time where it is very difficult for people to let God be God.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.160]   And to conceive of a God with this much authority, this much complexity, this much power is almost
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.400]   impossible for many modern people.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:06.160]   Beware of being stopped from believing the Bible by being a child of your time.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.680]   Now with those preliminaries, let me just give you some texts and draw a conclusion.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.840]   First Ephesians 111, "In him we have obtained an inheritance in Christ.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.560]   Having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.520]   counsel of his will."
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520]   All things.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.320]   Now the question is, does all things worked according to the counsel of his will include
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.400]   the final destiny of individuals?
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.720]   I think so.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.740]   Next, Proverbs 16, 4, "The Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.800]   of trouble."
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.760]   God has made the wicked for the day of trouble.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.240]   First Peter 2, 7, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone and a
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.480]   stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.680]   They stumble because they disobey the word as they were destined to do."
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.760]   They disobey the word as they were destined to do.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:17.240]   Jude 1, 4, "Certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.800]   this condemnation, ungodly people who pervert the grace of our God."
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.900]   Second Peter 2, 3, "And in their greed, they will exploit you with false words.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:34.000]   Their condemnation from long ago is not idle and their destruction is not asleep."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.720]   Romans 9, 11, "Jacob and Esau were not yet born, had done nothing good or bad in order
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.440]   that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.520]   calls.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.440]   She was told," this is before they were born or had done anything good or evil, "She was
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.840]   told the older will serve the younger.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.960]   As it is written, 'Jacob I loved, Esau I hated.'"
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.060]   That's a quote from Malachi 1, 2, and 3, which ought to be read in context where the text
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:09.400]   makes clear that God is sovereignly before they were born, choosing Jacob over Esau,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:18.920]   but showing that Esau's wickedness was real and blameworthy and he was responsible for
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   it.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.200]   One last verse, Romans 9, 22, following, "What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:31.280]   make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.960]   in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.240]   beforehand for glory."
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.300]   So I'm leaving those texts pretty much uncommented on, just holding them out there.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.760]   My answer is yes, God does determine from eternity who will be saved, who will be lost,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:00.280]   but he does it in ways that are mysterious to us so that on that day, no one will find
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.340]   any legitimate fault with God.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.340]   No one.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:12.400]   The redeemed will know we are saved utterly by grace while deserving hell, and the rest
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:22.000]   will know that they suppressed much knowledge of God's grace and they deserve to perish.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Very sobering.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.920]   So is election, then, divine favoritism?
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.380]   That was a related question and we addressed that back in episode number 399.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.680]   You can find that episode in the Ask Pastor John podcast archive if you'd like to hear
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   that.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.680]   That was episode number 399.
