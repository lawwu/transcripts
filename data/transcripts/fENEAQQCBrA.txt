[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the message of that great twentieth
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.720]   chapter of the book of Exodus, most of which we read together just now in the reading.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:25.160]   This chapter in which I recorded the giving of the Ten Commandments and the Ten Commandments
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:35.040]   themselves. I call your attention to this as a part of a process we've been considering
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.800]   on a number of Sunday nights, the message of the Bible for today, the message of the
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.720]   Bible for us in our present position and predicament. And we are doing so because it is of the very
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.160]   essence of the Christian message to say that here and here alone have we the message of
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.400]   God for men. We are living in a world which is full of troubles and of problems and of
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.640]   trials. We are aware that all sorts and kinds of expedience are being proposed and are being
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.560]   tried, and yet our troubles persist. And the question confronting all thoughtful people
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.240]   in the world therefore tonight is, what is wrong? What is the matter? And how can it
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:36.680]   be put right? Well now, our case is that the Bible has the only adequate and true answer
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:47.080]   to these questions. And the answer can be put quite simply. Things are as they are because
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:57.000]   man refuses to listen to God. That's the cause of the trouble. It always has been.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.960]   And as long as it continues, it will lead ever to the same conditions and the same results.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.720]   Man is always optimistic. Man in sin is always confident that somehow or another a day will
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.160]   come when he'll get over his troubles and problems. He took up with great avidity nearly
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.440]   a hundred years ago the so-called theory of evolution, because here at last was a theory
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.880]   which was virtually telling men that in spite of him and all his follies and all his errors
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.840]   and mistakes, the process was taking place inevitably. Whether men liked it or not or
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.560]   willed it or not, he was evolving and advancing, and perfection was merely a question of time.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.120]   But we're not quite as confident today as they were a hundred years ago. Something's
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.480]   gone wrong with the program somewhere. The twentieth century should have been so much
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.480]   better than the nineteenth if that theory is true. But it's very difficult to prove
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.160]   that if you were put to it. We've had all this terrible catastrophe in this twentieth
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.280]   century, and men and women are shaken. And they're not so confident, I say, about this
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.760]   inevitability of progress and of development. Well, the Bible, I say, has been saying from
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:31.320]   the very beginning that the trouble lies in this one thing. Man in alienation from God.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.000]   Man's refusal to listen to God. Now, we've been tracing this, you see, it began way back
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.960]   at the very beginning. Man's always ready to blame his circumstances. He says, "If
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.240]   only I had a chance. If only my environment could be put right. If only I really were
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.600]   given an opportunity to show what is in me." He's always confident that given those opportunities,
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.280]   he really would show what he can do. Well, the answer is that he's had all that. He
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.200]   was made perfect, he was put in paradise. And it was in paradise that men sinned. The
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.800]   environment was absolutely perfect. Nothing could be added to it. It was there he fell.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.640]   And he fell because he raised himself up against God and rebelled against him. That's the
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.520]   whole origin, and there it is historically. Well, then we've been following the story
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.080]   on. In spite of men having done that, God didn't put an end to life in this world.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.560]   He as it were gave men another opportunity, thrust him out of the garden, of course, and
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.160]   punished him for his sin and arrogance and rebellion, but nevertheless gave him a gracious
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.360]   promise. But again, men paid no attention. And we arrived in that terrible state of affairs
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.280]   that obtained before the flood, and God again manifested his wrath against it. He punished
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.200]   it. He told men exactly what he was doing. There again, I say, he manifested himself
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.400]   and his glory. And again, men was given another opportunity. But you remember, we've seen
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   that that led to the folly and the madness and the arrogance of the Tower of Babel. Men
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.120]   still trying to preserve an independence of God, and still confident that he could make
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   a perfect world, this city of men. And do you remember what happened? God again came
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.920]   down and punished it, and destroyed and frustrated men's schemes and plans and darling ideas.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   And again, there was confusion. But God has not only behaved in that way. We came last
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.160]   Sunday night and saw this, that God in his loving kindness towards mankind, not only
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:00.560]   puts it in that form, he puts it in a positive form. For we found that God chose and called
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.640]   a man whose name was Abram, who lived in a pagan land, surrounded by paganism. God called
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.520]   that man and called him out. And he told him that if he but listened to him, he would bless
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.080]   him, he'd make a great name for him, he would establish his seed, and out of his seed, he
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:28.040]   would send a blessing to the whole world of men. And we saw that Abram, who became known
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   as the friend of God, the greatest gentleman perhaps of all history, we have seen that
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:43.080]   he was the man that he was because of his faithfulness to God, his obedience to God,
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:49.040]   his readiness to listen to God. We are told that he did not set out to build an earthly
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:58.640]   city. He had got his eye on a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.280]   He went out not knowing whether he went, but God had called him so he listened. He dwelt
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.920]   with his children in tents and tabernacles because he realized that here are we no continuing
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.360]   city, but we seek one to come. And he was blessed and lived a noble and a triumphant
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:26.240]   life. Read his story for yourselves. Well, there in this man Abram, God forms a new nation.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.320]   Hebrews, the Jews, the children of Israel. And through this nation, he's going to reveal
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.680]   himself still more to the world. He's got a great purpose that he's going to bring to
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   pass through this nation. You remember the story, don't you? Abram begat Isaac, Isaac
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.180]   begat Jacob, Jacob had those twelve sons, the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel,
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.320]   and they had their large families. But owing to a famine, they had to go down to Egypt
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.200]   where there was a plentiful supply of corn. But then after being there for some time,
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:08.520]   you remember, they began to be maltreated. They were virtually nothing but slaves, though
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.840]   they were God's chosen people. And they were having a very hard time with cruel taskmasters
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:21.360]   whipping them and forcing them to make bricks without straw, and in every way that they
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:29.240]   could, maltreating them. The story undoubtedly would have ended in their extinction were
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:35.920]   it not that God again intervened and came down. And by a series of amazing and miraculous
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.480]   events and incidents, he brought them out of the captivity of Egypt. He destroyed Pharaoh
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:47.040]   and his hosts. He enabled the children of Israel to cross the Red Sea on dry land, as
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.400]   it were. He led them through the wilderness and eventually brought them into the land
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.160]   of Canaan. But, and this is the thing that we are concerned about tonight, God having
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.280]   brought them out and having delivered them from the bondage and the thralldom and the
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:11.600]   cruelty of Egypt, caused them as it were to pause on their journey. And there he spoke
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:19.280]   to them in the way which is described in chapters 19 and 20 of this book of Exodus, and which
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:25.760]   is elaborated in the following and subsequent chapters. Now what's the meaning of this?
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:33.360]   Well the meaning of this is this. God having done all this for this people now addresses
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:40.920]   them in a very direct manner. And what he says is this, he says, "You are my people."
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.800]   But though you are my people, that's not the end of the story. Though you are my people,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:54.640]   you are only going to enjoy a life of blessing on condition that you live as I would have
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   you live. God confronted these people with two possibilities, two alternatives. It can
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:08.360]   either be a life of blessing or else it must be cursing. Man in this life and in this world
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:14.840]   is either going to live under the mighty hand of God in blessing and in peace and joy and
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:22.360]   happiness or else he's going to live a wretched and a miserable existence. Things are going
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.920]   to go wrong with him. There will be a kind of curse upon him and in spite of the fact
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.600]   that he will persist in thinking that all is going to be well as I say, things will
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.840]   ever go wrong with him. It's either blessing or cursing and God repeatedly said that to
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:47.720]   the children of Israel. But here on this occasion he stated it in a particularly clear and systematic
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.080]   manner. God had been saying it as I've reminded you from the very creation of men and the
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:59.840]   creation of the world. But here at last he puts it if you like in the form of a code.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.000]   He'd been speaking it in words, he'd been speaking it in action and in history, but
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.520]   men didn't seem to grasp it. So God now puts it as a system if you like of rules and regulations
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.760]   so that the various child can see it quite clearly. There's no ambiguity, it's not some
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:23.400]   abstruse philosophy. God just said this, that, that and that, ten points and there they are.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.880]   You can put them on the wall if you like and you can see exactly what they are. Now said
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:36.880]   God to these people, those are the conditions on which I will bless you. But if you don't
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:43.520]   adhere to them, I will not bless you. And though you are my people and though you are
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:51.640]   the nation that I have made out of this one man Abram, nothing but cursing will attend
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:59.080]   you and your life will be one of constant misery and unhappiness. Now I'm calling your
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:06.480]   attention to this again for just this reason. There is no question at all but that the world
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:16.120]   tonight is as it is because we ignore what God said here to the children of Israel. That's
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.680]   the whole explanation of the whole trouble. Go through the story of the children of Israel
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:29.240]   in this Old Testament, it's an amazing record. The very people of God and yet look at their
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:35.480]   checkered history. Look at the depths to which they sank. Look at the heights to which they
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:42.600]   rose. Look at their misery and wretchedness and their bondage and captivity. Look at them
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   on the other hand when they conquer all their enemies and are enjoying a great abundance
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:54.560]   and a wonderful prosperity. What determines it? It's always this. Whenever they were right
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:01.200]   with God, he blessed them and their life was noble and wonderful. But when they rebel and
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.720]   refuse to keep God's law and turn after other gods as they persistently did, everything
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.680]   invariably went wrong with them. Well, very well, what is there then that is more important
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:19.400]   for us than to consider the message of this great incident? The giving of the law to the
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:27.080]   children of Israel, the promulgation of the Ten Commandments, God giving his laws, his
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:34.200]   rules and regulations for life, how life is to be lived if men would be blessed and if
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:41.840]   he would truly prosper. This evening I want to take a general view of these Ten Commandments.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.800]   I'm picking out these great incidents in the Scripture. There are certain events in the
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.280]   Old Testament that stand out preeminently. We've been looking at them already, you see.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.760]   I've already reminded you of them. Now here is this noble incident, this mighty incident,
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.800]   and I'm simply going to look at it in general. We could spend weeks on it. I'm not proposing
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:09.000]   to do so. I'm picking out these great speeches of God, if you like, these great occasions
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.140]   when God came down and spoke to the people, all of them leading up to the final word which
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:23.000]   he spoke in his only begotten Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.920]   Very well, what has he said here? What's the message? Very fortunately for us, our Lord
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:40.080]   himself has expounded this message. One afternoon certain clever people came to our Lord and
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.720]   they said, "We've got a question to put to you." And our Lord said, "Well, what's your
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:54.440]   question?" And they said, "Tell us which in your opinion is the first, the chiefest, the
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:04.280]   greatest commandment of all?" And our Lord answered them and said, "Thou shalt love the
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:13.480]   Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:20.200]   That is the first and the chiefest commandment, and the second is likened to it. Thou shalt
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   love thy neighbor as thyself." Now there in that one statement you have this perfect summary
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:36.640]   of the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments can be divided up perfectly in that way into
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:44.400]   two sections. We generally refer to them, don't we, as the two tables of the law. The
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:51.240]   first table has reference to our attitude towards and our relationship to God. The second
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.120]   has reference to our attitude towards and our relationship towards our fellow men and
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:02.680]   women. The first table, second table. And you can divide your Ten Commandments quite
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.920]   easily in that way. Well, very well. Let's follow our Lord's own exposition. And by doing
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:15.640]   so we shall discover the principles which God was concerned to inculcate and to put
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:22.160]   into the minds of the children of Israel and through them to us and the whole of humanity.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:30.200]   What are the lessons? Well, let me summarize them. The first is this. The supreme thing
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:42.400]   in life is to be in a right relationship to God. There is no question about that. Take
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.640]   the order of these commandments, the Ten Commandments. What do you find? Well, I have just been telling
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.320]   you, just been reminding you. You've got the two divisions, but you notice one of them
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:02.160]   comes before the other. And the first division is the one in which we are reminded of our
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.960]   relationship to God. In other words, you see, we come and we ask, "Well now, what am I
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.760]   to do in order to have a happy and a contented life? What am I to do in order that I may
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.640]   avoid my personal problems? What's the whole world got to do tonight in order that it may
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:26.160]   deliver itself from all its troubles and its trials and its wars and all its calamities?
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:32.840]   What have we got to do?" And you notice that the answer comes back and talks to us
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:41.760]   about God. "I am the Lord thy God." That's how it starts. It doesn't start with our
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.520]   level. It doesn't start by saying, "Well now, then let's have a look at your problems.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.280]   Let's take them one by one and let's see what can be done about them." Not at all.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:56.160]   For the moment, it turns its back upon all our problems and holds us face to face with
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:12.800]   God. God first, man second. And the order is absolutely vital. If I were asked to give
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:24.080]   an opinion as to what I would call or regard as the most fatal blunder in human thinking
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.840]   tonight, I would say without any hesitation that it's just the failure to remember this
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:42.000]   order. Here is the crucial, fatal error of men, that he will persist in thinking without
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.760]   starting with God. Now, I think you'll agree, in other words, that the modern world approves
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:57.720]   the case of the Bible to the very hilt. More and more during the last hundred years, and
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:06.120]   especially in this century, men have been trying to live entirely apart from God. You
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.240]   know all about it. The confidence and the optimism, the belief in science, the belief
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.860]   in knowledge and so on, that God was no longer necessary and we don't need him and so on.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.080]   And we've been trying to make life and to live in this world apart from God. And you
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:28.000]   see the result. Now it's the very thing God was announcing in the Ten Commandments.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:36.360]   And this is so perfectly obvious if you stop to think of it. You cannot regard men and
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:44.920]   his problems right and correctly unless you regard men in his relationship to God. Of
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.160]   course, we're all very concerned about these human relationships. We said there's another
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.960]   international conference, it's just broken down at Geneva. Now what's the matter? Why
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.280]   can't the nations get on? Why can't men get on? Why are there divisions and disputes
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.500]   between class and class, employer and labor and so on and so forth? What's the meaning
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:10.100]   of all these personal clashes? This is the great problem we are told by the philosophers
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:18.880]   is the problem of relationships. And of course we know that it is. Divorce, separation, infidelity,
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:25.320]   all these breakdowns all along the line of personal human relationships. And we are setting
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.960]   up commission after commission, we are bringing into being fresh organizations in order to
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:38.760]   try to deal with these relationships. And life is becoming amazingly complicated. They
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:44.040]   seem to be able to run industry in the past without personnel managers. You can't today.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.760]   You've got to have people to look after people and another to look after this one and so
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.320]   on. The whole thing is becoming a gigantic scheme. We're all trying to put ourselves
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:59.640]   right with one another. What's the matter with us all? Ah, the matter with us all is
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:08.080]   that we've all together forgotten God. You don't understand men properly until you look
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:17.160]   at men in terms of God. Somebody said the proper study of mankind is men. Up to a point
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.520]   it's true, but there's another thing which is much more true. The proper study of mankind
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:29.840]   is God. For men has been made by God and he's been made in such a way that he cannot function
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.680]   truly as a man unless he's in the right relationship with God. It's no use arguing about that,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.720]   it's a fact. And history proves it to be a fact. When man tries to run himself and his
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.400]   world forgetting this, he always gets into trouble. The moment he comes back to this,
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:57.040]   all goes well with him. Now I say that this is just a fact of history. History proves
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:05.580]   invariably that when mankind does honor God, its human relationships solve themselves.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:11.320]   You just work it out in terms of your secular history books. You will find invariably that
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:20.560]   every great religious revival is followed by general benefits in every realm and department
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:28.360]   of life. It's invariable. You get that after the Protestant Reformation. You had it in
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.520]   a most notable manner after the evangelical awakening of the 18th century. There were
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:40.040]   undoubtedly great advances made in the last century, the 19th century. Many humanitarian
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.600]   acts of Parliament were passed, slavery was prohibited, child labor was prohibited, factory
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.780]   acts were passed, and so on. There was a tremendous mitigation of injustices and an amelioration
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:58.280]   of wrongs and of troubles. Where did it come from? It came in the wake of the evangelical
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:04.080]   revival of the previous century. Once men are right with God, they get right with one
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:12.160]   another. Why? Well, they begin to see one another truly. And to see one another truly,
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:23.320]   we must see ourselves as under God. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. If
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.880]   I look at myself and look at other men and women apart from God, what is it? Well, it's
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.960]   this. I set myself up as a God and they do the same. I want everything for myself, so
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.180]   do they. And the result is clashes inevitably. We both want the same thing, therefore we
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:46.640]   fight and quarrel. That's the whole essence of the trouble in the world tonight. My rights,
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:52.040]   a sovereign nation, a sovereign individual, and every other nation and every other individual
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.760]   sovereign, and it's a fight amongst gods. Why? Well, because we are not all of us on
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:05.360]   our knees worshipping the one and only true and living God.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.000]   The second commandment said, "O blessed Lord, is this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.080]   Yes, but if you don't know what you are, how can you love your neighbor truly? And you
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.280]   see, you don't know what you are until you've seen yourself as a creature made by God and
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:29.200]   under God, and dependent upon God. And once you see yourself as that, well then you begin
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.400]   to see your fellow men and women in the same way, and you've got an entirely different
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:41.080]   attitude towards them. So that the order in which these commandments are put is tremendously
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:50.400]   important. The first table must come before the second. I say once more that history proves
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:58.440]   this absolutely, and the whole tragedy of the world in sin this evening is that men
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.600]   and women are trying to solve the problems of the world by dealing only with the second
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.760]   table. They don't say a word about the first table. They're trusting the politicians,
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.040]   they're trusting the philosophers, they're trusting the sociologists, they're convinced
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.960]   that money is the root of it. Some say it's entirely economic, and so on and so forth.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.820]   They're entirely in the second table. They don't say a word about God. God never enters
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:29.720]   into the calculation. And the problem persists and things go from bad to worse. There's
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.640]   no real respect for man himself. We're all self-centered and we forget all others. That's
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:43.760]   the difficulty. We've forgotten the first table, and we rush to the second. And what
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:50.000]   invariably happens is this. When men and women don't observe the first table, they very soon
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.800]   begin to neglect and ignore the second table also. You can't have the second without the
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.640]   first, and if you don't keep the first, you won't keep the second. And the chaos of the
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:08.440]   modern world is due to the failure to observe the first table of the law. Very well then,
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:16.120]   having said that, let us look at the first table. What does it tell us? Well, the first
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:24.960]   table tells us something about God himself. The first object which God had in view in
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:31.320]   giving the Ten Commandments and speaking to the children of Israel on Mount Sinai was
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:43.840]   to reveal himself. And it's the greatest need in the world tonight to know God. Our troubles,
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.040]   I say, all finally come back to this, that we are so ignorant of God and that our ideas
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:56.240]   of God are so utterly and absolutely false. So God revealed himself, and what did he reveal?
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:12.720]   He revealed himself as the all-powerful and the eternal God. Have we a sense of God? Do
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:20.480]   we realize that God made us and not ourselves? Do we realize that God said, "Let there be
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:27.880]   light," and there was light? That God is the author of the whole cosmos, the whole entire
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:39.040]   universe, and brought it into being out of nothing? The self-existent, eternal, everlasting
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:48.480]   God, existing from eternity to eternity, sufficient in and of himself, the all-powerful, almighty
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:57.600]   God? He revealed himself as that. There were thunders, there was lightning, there was an
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:09.320]   earthquake. God just gave a glimpse of his everlasting Godhead and creatorship.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:18.040]   If you and I in the whole world only realize that we are under the hand of such a God,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:24.280]   it is a fearful thing, says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, it is a fearful
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:37.880]   thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Our God is a consuming fire. My dear
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:45.040]   friend, the trouble with every one of us is that we do not know God. If we but realize
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.120]   that as we walk and live for this brief little spend which we are given in this life and
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:57.960]   in this world, ever under the eye of this almighty, august being, oh, what a difference
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:04.560]   it would make to life. How carefully we would all live, how tenderly would we all walk,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.880]   how concerned we would be and solicitous about others and their welfare, with the eye of
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:23.120]   God upon us and it is upon us. And he revealed his holiness. He is a holy God. We cannot
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:32.560]   conceive of it. He is of such a pure countenance that he cannot look upon sin. Our God is a
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:44.080]   consuming fire. God is light and in him is no darkness at all. Can you think of that?
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.440]   Can you conceive it? No, no, our minds are too small, aren't they? They bubble at such
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:55.400]   a conception and we are so sinful and so unworthy, we can't think of utter, absolute holiness
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:02.920]   without the slightest suspicion of adulteration. We can't imagine it, but that is God. God
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:09.480]   is light and in him is no darkness at all. He is the father of lights with whom is no
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:17.080]   variableness, neither shadow of turning. And that is the God that is looking down upon
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:23.400]   us. That is the God whom we will have to meet. We are all in the presence of this being,
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:31.960]   this holy God that revealed himself here in his law as given to the children of Israel.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:37.840]   Listen to the Apostle Paul saying something about him. He says that he dwelleth in the
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:47.600]   light which is unapproachable. God no man hath seen at any time, he says. He dwells
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:57.200]   in that eternal light. An Old Testament prophet asks, who can dwell with the everlasting burning?
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:04.000]   You go through your Bible and read the visions which certain men like Isaiah had of God in
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.760]   his holiness and in his glory, and you'll find that every one of them fell down. They
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:17.320]   were alarmed and terrified. Woe is me, says Isaiah, I'm a man of unclean lips. Who can
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:23.920]   stand in his presence? Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Who can dwell in his
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:35.040]   holy presence? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart? For God is absolutely holy,
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:43.800]   everlasting purity and righteousness and justice. He revealed that here. And he likewise revealed
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:49.400]   that he is the judge eternal. Visiting he tells us here the iniquity of the fathers
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:55.040]   upon the children and to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him. And showing
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:03.200]   mercy unto thousands of them that love him and keep his commandments. My dear friends,
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.520]   if we only realize this, the message of Christianity doesn't start with the second tables. It
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.760]   isn't simply to tell you how you can be happy and get over this or that particular problem.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:20.800]   No, no. The first message of the scripture is this, that we are all under God. And that
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:27.680]   is God. You can't escape him, you can't get away from him. He's everywhere. He's
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:33.320]   omniscient, he's omnipresent. The psalmist argues it out in the 139th Psalm. If I go
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.280]   into heaven, he's there. If I descend into hell, lo thou art there. Thou knowest my down
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.000]   sitting and my up rising. I can't escape. You can't get out of his universe. He's
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:53.080]   above it and beyond it. He made it all out of nothing. God! Have you a sense of God,
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.760]   I ask? Do you realize that he's looking upon you at this very moment? That you can
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:05.160]   never be out of his presence. He revealed it. But let me his none. He tells us what
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:13.880]   he demands of us. And he tells us first of all what he demands of us as regards himself.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.640]   And it follows of necessity from what he has said about himself. Here are the points. I'm
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.040]   not working them out, I'm simply giving you the list. Thou shalt have no other gods
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:36.000]   beside me. He is the only God. And we must not recognize any other God. We mustn't
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.880]   regard ourselves as gods. We mustn't regard husband, wife, children as gods. We mustn't
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:50.120]   regard our country as something to be worshipped. And the world is full of these strange gods
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:56.480]   today. We are worshipping other gods. We put the Lord God Almighty on one side and we put
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.360]   these other things in the first place and we bow down and worship. But we mustn't.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.480]   He tells us thou shalt have no other gods beside me. Neither must we make any graven
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:13.920]   image. Why mustn't we make images? I'll tell you. We mustn't make images because
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.680]   all of them detract from the glory of God. God is spirit. You can't give him form. No
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.480]   man hath seen God at any time. You haven't seen his shape, said the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.600]   to the Jews. And to attempt to reduce God to an image, something that man makes, is
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:39.400]   to detract from his everlasting glory. Therefore, away with images. Whether they're even meant
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:46.120]   to be images of God or not, they're not to be tolerated. No graven images. And then you
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:52.880]   notice we're not to take his name in vain. And the world is taking his name in vain.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.880]   You hear the comedians ending their program saying, "God bless you." It's taking the
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:05.360]   name of God in vain. "My God," says a man, "this has happened to me." And the poor
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:15.440]   man doesn't realize what he's saying. He's taking the name of this eternal God in vain.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.000]   And God has prohibited that, and God says that certain consequences will follow doing
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.360]   that. What else? We are not to take his day in vain either. For God has appointed that
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:34.120]   one day in seven should be his day. Why? Oh, not just to make us live a mechanical life,
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:42.320]   but for this reason. God knows us, and God knows how forgetful we are of him. We are
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.440]   busy with our professions and our business and our work and our affairs and our pleasures.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.120]   And we say, "You know, at night I'm too tired to read the Bible. I'm too tired to pray."
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.760]   And then in the morning we haven't got time. God says, "One day in seven, stop everything.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:02.280]   Give it to me. Remain in yourselves of me. Come to me. Come and worship me. Think about
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:12.200]   me. Praise me. Pray to me. Consider me." One day in seven, that's all he asks. And man
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:18.360]   doesn't give it him. Though he now only works five days a week in the main, he doesn't give
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:24.080]   this day to God. He hasn't got time for it. He's thus detracting from the glory of God
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:30.360]   and refusing to worship God with all his heart and all his soul and all his mind and all
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:37.560]   his strength. It isn't the particular day that matters. It is that one day in seven
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:45.960]   is given to God and given entirely to God. Are you doing it, my friend? It isn't a question
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.360]   of Sabbatarianism. That's not a thing I'm interested in. It's not a bit of legalism.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:55.000]   It's just this, that we ought to thank God that we have one day where we can give it
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.400]   entirely to him. But alas, I find even many Christian people write their family letters
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:08.520]   on Sunday. You shouldn't do it, my friends. It's sin. It's taking a part of God's day
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.800]   for your family. The whole day must be given to God. And there are those who only come
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.720]   to morning worship and are never seen in the evening. They spend their time at home reading
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:24.840]   or something else. It's not giving it all to God. He wants the whole day. He only asks
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:31.560]   for one in seven that we may meditate upon him and upon our relationship to him and his
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:38.840]   glory and what he's done for us. There is the law with regard to our relationship to
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:44.360]   God and then in the second table he tells us about our relationship to one another.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.200]   And you see it all follows inevitably from the first. "Thou shalt honor thy father and
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:57.440]   thy mother." Why? Because fatherhood and motherhood are reflections of God and our
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:05.360]   relationship to him. It's God who brought fatherhood and motherhood into being, not
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:12.440]   men. It's God who's ordained the family. And all these things are reflections of our
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.800]   ultimate relationship to him. So honor your father and your mother because God is the
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:28.040]   father of fatherhood. He is the ultimate father of all, father of spirits. So we must honor
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:34.160]   our father and mother. And then we go on, "Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.000]   murder." In other words, you must not take the law into your own hands. Why must you
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.920]   not murder another man? Well, he's been made in the image of God and you are doing
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.120]   something to the image of God when you take the law into your own hands and murder another.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:58.520]   "Thou shalt not kill, thou must recognize his individuality and entity as it's given
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:06.280]   to him by God. And in the same way thou shalt not commit adultery. God ordained that men
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:12.120]   and women should come together. He appointed a helpmeet for the first men and he said the
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:20.960]   twain shall be one flesh. They become one and you must not break into that for you're
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.640]   violating something that God has ordained and again you're defacing the image. So you
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:33.720]   must not commit adultery, not on human grounds but on divine grounds because man is under
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:41.480]   God and belongs to God. What else? "Thou shalt not steal," again for the same reason
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:46.080]   you see every one of these is because of men's relationship to God. It isn't simply because
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:51.000]   you break a law and because it belongs to the other men. No, no, you're taking something
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.840]   from his identity, his individuality, what God has made him. So you must not steal. And
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:04.180]   in the same way you must not bear false witness against your neighbor. In all these actions
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:11.240]   you see we are detracting from the greatness of man made in the image of God. And that
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:16.480]   is why God prohibits it. And then you come to the last one which is "Thou shalt not covet
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:21.640]   thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man's servant,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   nor his maid's servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's."
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:35.480]   You see you recognize each one as an entity under God and you respect him for that reason.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:44.000]   You see him as a creature of God. So God has told us what we've got to do, both as regards
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.320]   himself and as regards our fellow men and women. He's taught us that here. But you know
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:58.640]   God gave all this in order to teach us something else which is this, that we can never carry
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:06.560]   all this out. The children of Israel in their folly believed that they could carry it out.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.360]   When Moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:17.240]   all these words which the Lord commended him, the people all answered together and said,
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:30.560]   "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do." But they didn't. And they didn't because men
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:38.280]   in sin couldn't. The law says the Lord Jesus Christ is this, "Thou shalt love the Lord
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:46.880]   thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength." Have
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:53.920]   you done it? This we will do, they say, but they can't. And the Apostle Paul in the eighth
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.040]   chapter of the epistle to the Romans in the third verse puts it like this once and forever,
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:05.840]   "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh." The law is perfect,
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:11.080]   yes, but show me the men who can keep it. God gave the law to these people. Why? In
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.920]   order to convince them that their arrogance and their self-confidence was entirely misplaced.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:22.240]   They cannot keep it. They said they could, "Very well," says God, "this is what I want
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.720]   you to do. If you can keep this you'll satisfy me." And they couldn't and they failed.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:39.360]   But let us remember that God tells us that failure to do all this is sin, and that he
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:47.680]   hates sin and that he will punish sin. And that if we fail in any one point of this law,
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:53.320]   we have failed in the whole law because every single one of them, as we've seen, is directly
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.260]   related to God. Very well then, my friends, the position that God has revealed about us
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:08.280]   to ourselves is this, that the important question to ask at this moment is, "Not have I been
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:14.120]   guilty of this, that, or the other?" We start with the first table, "Am I living entirely
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:22.680]   to the glory of God? Have I no other God besides him? Do I never take his name in vain? Am
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:29.000]   I not taking his day in vain? Am I honoring all his laws in my relationships to others
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:41.960]   because he is God? Have I kept it with all my being? And if I haven't, I am a sinner.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:47.800]   I am guilty of terrible sin." You see, there are people who say, "You know," they say,
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.520]   "I can't honestly say that I feel I'm a sinner." You know what they mean by that?
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.040]   They say they've never got drunk, they've not been guilty of adultery, and they say,
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.160]   "I really don't feel I'm a sinner." Why? Because they've never started with the first
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:10.800]   table. They've never asked the question, "What is my relationship to God?" Are you living
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   entirely to the glory of God? If not, you're a terrible sinner. Do you see any need of
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:25.560]   God in your life? Is God in the center of your life and of your heart? If he isn't,
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:31.000]   you're insulting him in the most abominable manner. You know perfectly well what would
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.800]   happen to you if you turned your back on the Queen in Buckingham Palace. When you're presented
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.560]   to the Queen, when you leave her, you don't turn your back and walk away. You have to
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.520]   walk back like this. And yet, what are we all doing with God? We deliberately turn our
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:51.480]   backs upon him with oaths and cursing. Perhaps not with oaths and cursing, but with extreme
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:59.640]   politeness. We just ignore him altogether. And we put ourselves before him. We put our
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:05.080]   children before him. We put our money, our possession, all these other things, all the
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:12.800]   insult to this holy, eternal God. That's sin, and God must punish it. And God will punish
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:22.760]   it, and he's revealed it in his Ten Commandments. "He gave the law," says the apostle, "in
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:30.440]   order to show the exceeding sinfulness of sin. He gave it to show men that they could
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:36.880]   never by their own efforts and striving reach him and satisfy him and please him. He has
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:46.440]   shown them that they're all in sin and all under wrath." So that finally, you see, he
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:53.520]   gave the law for this reason. He gave it in the words of the apostle Paul, in order that
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:59.760]   it might become our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. What does that mean? It just
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:10.240]   means this. He gave the law in order to convince everybody that without Christ they're absolutely
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:23.520]   lost and hopeless and doomed. How? Well, like this. God's demands must be satisfied. God's
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:31.280]   law must be fulfilled. God doesn't give a law just to play with us. When God gave his
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:43.600]   law, he said, "This must be kept." And no man has ever kept it. No man, as I say, ever
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:50.280]   can keep it. And yet we must keep it. We cannot see God and heaven unless this law is honored
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.400]   and kept. We cannot do so. Have you tried? Well, if you haven't tried, and I'll assure
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:02.360]   you, you'll be farther away at the end of this week than you were now. But God's law
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:09.280]   must be kept. It must be honored. It must be fulfilled. We cannot, "Well, are we therefore
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:16.360]   irretrievably doomed?" No, no. God has sent his only Son from heaven to earth. He took
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:25.040]   on the likeness of human flesh, and as a man he kept it absolutely, first and second tables,
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:33.200]   not a jot, not a tittle failed. He kept it perfectly. And he did it for us. The law makes
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:40.520]   me see my need of him. Not only that, because we have failed to keep this law, we have sinned
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:47.640]   against God and we need forgiveness. What can I do about this? How can God forgive my
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:53.520]   sin? He's a just and a holy and a righteous God. He doesn't change, and he hates sin.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:48:03.960]   How can he forgive me then in my sin and still remain just? That's a question the law raises,
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:11.280]   and the answer is still in the same person and in the same place. "He hath set him forth,"
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.320]   says the Apostle Paul in the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans, "as the propitiation
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:25.080]   for our sins, that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus."
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:32.260]   You realize what that means? It means this. God being God must punish sin, and the punishment
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:38.480]   of sin is death and separation from God, as we saw in the third of Genesis. Very well,
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:43.640]   God must do this. And yet, well, how can he do that? And yet I be saved and dwell with
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:55.280]   God. Here's the answer. God has taken our sins and put them on his own Son. The Son
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:01.300]   submitted himself willingly, voluntarily, passively, and allowed the sins to be placed
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:07.480]   upon him. And God has dealt with them and has punished them there. My sins were punished
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:15.680]   in Christ, and God therefore can justly forgive me. He's just and the justifier of him that
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:24.940]   believeth in Jesus. The Ten Commandments tell us that that was the only way in which even
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:30.100]   God can forgive sin. God can't say, "I'll forget that. I'll pretend I haven't seen it.
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.900]   God is just." He can't speak like that, and he doesn't. God must be just. God must keep
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:45.700]   his character. God must punish sin. God has punished sin. This law drives me to Christ.
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:52.140]   I have forgiveness in him and in him alone. But having had the forgiveness and having
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:57.220]   seen the love of God, I now want to please God and live to the glory of God. How can
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:04.020]   I with my fallen nature? Again I'm driven to Christ. He gives me a new nature. For what
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:09.500]   the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:17.460]   likeness of sinful flesh and forcing condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:25.620]   the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit.
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:38.220]   Still in Christ, you see. It is all in Christ. His righteousness is given to me. In him I
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:44.900]   have forgiveness. In him I have new life. In him I have power and strength and all I
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:56.060]   need. And in him I begin to look at everybody else in a new way. The world was divided into
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:03.460]   Jews and Gentiles until Christ came and died upon the cross. And the Jew regarded the Gentile
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.860]   as a dog outside the pail. And the Gentile with his Greek philosophy and learning and
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:13.820]   his Roman law despised the Jew. And they hated one another. And there was a great middle
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:23.100]   wall of partition between them. But when they both saw themselves as helpless, hopeless
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:29.700]   sinners in the presence of a holy God and realized their equal helplessness and hopelessness
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:35.500]   and saw that there was only one Savior and one salvation for them both, namely Christ
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:41.300]   who died for them, they both came to him together. They held hands and they joined in the same
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:51.660]   hymn of praise and the middle wall of partition had gone. Christ makes one new man. He abolishes
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:59.260]   the enmity. He breaks down the middle wall of partition because by one Spirit, by the
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:21.620]   same one Spirit, we have access to the same Father by the same Christ.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:37.460]   That's the message. For the moment forget everything but this. God and yourself. God
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:52.020]   and you. And that will remain ever always. You will be you. And God will be God. And
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:58.340]   for eternity you are either going to enjoy his glorious presence and be blessed by him
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:09.540]   or you are going to spend your eternity outside him in misery. And there is only one way to
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:21.740]   the blessing. It is to believe his message concerning his only Son, our Lord and Savior
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:33.140]   Jesus Christ, who came to seek and to save that which was lost, to give his life a ransom
[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:46.220]   for many. Has the law of God brought you to Christ? If it hasn't, nothing else will.
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:54.180]   And until you see its meaning and its message, you remain in your sins and under the wrath
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:54:06.860]   of God. Oh, that the Lord tonight has become your schoolmaster to bring you to Christ and
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:13.020]   through him to God. Amen.
