[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   From sharing the best AI tools to hearing firsthand about what it's like to lose a house in a fire,
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.600]   to a new style of working out that might replace traditional strength training,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.280]   today I'm joined again to cover those things with my good friend Kevin Rose,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.480]   and we're going to do a deep dive into a lot of the questions you all sent in.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.000]   We're going to share which AI tools we're using for research, building apps,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.360]   taking notes, and some of the creative ways we use those tools.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.840]   We'll also cover how to make sure you're covered properly in case something happens to your home.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.760]   We're going to share how we think about where we want to live in the world, and a lot more.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.600]   We're going to get really tactical and personal, so I hope you love this one,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.080]   and thank you to everyone who sent questions in.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.320]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins. If you enjoy this episode, please share it with a friend,

[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.760]   And if you want to submit a question for the next one of these, whether it's with Kevin,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.920]   my wife Amy, or me just doing it solo, head on over to chrishutchins.com/AMA.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.680]   Kevin, thanks for being here.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.040]   Yeah, glad to be here.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.800]   So we did this last time. We had some questions come in. We sat down together.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.840]   There were a few follow-ups, and then a few things that came recently that I was like,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.680]   "Gosh, for me to answer this question would be great. For you to inject your
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.000]   opinion would also be great, and your experience."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.520]   So I'm going to start with one that we teased out the last time,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.960]   which is you wake up, you have no plans, no commitments, you're all alone.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.840]   How do you spend your day?
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.800]   Oh, man. It really depends on what the goal is for the day. For me,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   every day is a little bit different. If I didn't have any agenda, whatsoever-
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.240]   No agenda.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.800]   No agenda. I think self-care has to play a big part in what I want to do for that day,
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.880]   largely because my day-to-day is going through investment decks, looking at all the different
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.920]   startups, trying to get up to speed on all the latest AI stuff that's out there. It's very
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.760]   computer-centric, tech-heavy work, and everyone needs a break from their computer.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.040]   So that would mean I'd start off with a cup of coffee, obviously. I'm a little fancy when it
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.200]   comes to that shit where I like the single-origin pour-over stuff. And then I've been doing a lot of
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.440]   rope-based movement training recently, which is really more core work. You can think of it as
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.840]   jump rope on steroids.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.600]   Is this the big, thick rope?
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.680]   Yes, big, thick rope, but more swinging it around your head and moving in different ways
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.400]   that activate core, and the obliques, and the shoulders, and more of this idea of transitioning
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.840]   from the old-school version of Kevin 1.0, which was, "I'm young. Let's just do as many reps as
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.040]   possible. Let's get bigger muscles," into, "How can I make sure that on the longevity side,
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.560]   I'm increasing flexibility and making sure that the supporting structure around the muscles
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.680]   are being built out as well?" So it's not just about how big is your bicep. It's about how all
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.840]   that different connective tissue and all those other muscles aren't out of whack, so that when
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.600]   you have a seven-year-old running at you full force and you catch them sideways,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.640]   you don't throw out your back. It sounds like an old-person thing to say, but it is a pretty
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.360]   important piece of how I'm redefining what my exercise routine looks like.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.840]   Sauna is huge. Sauna, for me, is a non-negotiable daily thing in that if you can get 20 minutes at
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.000]   about 174-ish, 175-ish degrees, that's where all of the published studies are at, mostly coming
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.280]   out of Finland. Massive reductions in all-cause mortality, reduced dementia risk, reduced
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.480]   cardiovascular disease. There's no debate anymore. It is very healthy. The only thing to really
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.240]   pay attention to on that side is hotter than that doesn't necessarily mean better.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.800]   So we know that heat shock proteins, which are what we believe to be the suspects that are
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   doing all the positive stuff for our body, get released around 175. We also know that if you go
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.400]   too hot, especially if you don't protect your brain. So for me, I have that full-on felt cap
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.800]   all around the head. I'll take in some cold washcloths with me that I'll put underneath
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.280]   the felt. There has actually been some studies that show too hot can actually do damage. So
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.920]   it's finding that sweet spot there. And for people who don't know,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.680]   you can get the new sauna heaters. You could dial in the temperature to exactly what you want.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.960]   Yeah. I have done this, and I've dialed it in where I bring in my own Amazon $15 digital
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.040]   thermometer, hold it at chest level, which is where you want it, and just really make sure
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.200]   it's right around that 175, 178 kind of situation at chest level. And then I lift my legs up on the
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.280]   bench so I get the whole body exactly at that temperature. Yeah, we've got this sauna outside.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.880]   You can see it barely from Haven Sauna. And when we built it, we built it to Finnish standards,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.920]   not American standards, which are very different. And so we've got the vents in the right place.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.880]   I've seen some people whose saunas have the thermometer sensor above the rocks. And then
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.840]   you're like, "Oh wow, it's so hot," according to the temperature, but it's not that hot. And it's
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.280]   like, yeah, you put it right above the heat source. So you want it on the opposite wall.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.520]   Yeah. Sadly, if you actually contract someone to come and put a sauna in,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.080]   they're going to do exactly that, where they put the temperature sensor in the wrong place,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.720]   the airflow is going the wrong way. And they're building what I like to call just vanity saunas,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.160]   where it's like all glass walls. And it turns out glass leaks heat pretty fast.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.680]   And so you have to be careful and really, if you're going to take it seriously,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.000]   don't spend the money unless you really get the proper instruction. You had a great PDF
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.160]   that you should link to around the sauna. Yeah, there's this Trumpkin Guide to Saunas,
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.120]   which I'm going to warn because I have one friend who was like, "Oh, I'm interested." He
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.920]   went down the rabbit hole. It's a deep rabbit hole. Hey, listen, drop it into Notebook LM from
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.720]   Google, that PDF, and ask it to make a podcast for you from that. And then just listen to the
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.240]   podcast. Yeah. Fortunately, I met these two guys who started a few companies and they were like,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.360]   "We're going to start a sauna company." And they were like, "We love the Trumpkin Guide." I was
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.520]   like, "These are the guys I want a sauna from." And so that's where we got our sauna. The one
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.400]   thing that they're working on, imagine if you could charge a battery with 110 or 120 power,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.440]   which you get from a normal outlet. And then you could build up enough juice in that battery
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.360]   to run 240 for like an hour for your sauna. It would let you put a sauna anywhere. Because one
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.840]   of the biggest challenges is that sauna heaters need 240. So you've got to run electrical around
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.280]   your house. If it's not in the right place, it's a pain in the ass. So they're working on this
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.080]   battery solution because you don't need the sauna on 24/7. So if you had a big enough battery and
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.240]   it's not that big... It's like a power wall for... Yeah. Exactly. But just for the sauna.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.880]   But because you don't need constant use, you could charge it 110. Yeah. And I will say one
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.480]   other thing too, that's worth looking into. And I'm not getting paid for this plug or anything,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.960]   but we've had Plunge, both of us as previously as sponsors on our podcast. And you don't have
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.680]   to think about converting a room in your house. You can get these outdoor ones. My buddy has the
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.640]   Plunge one. He actually says great things about it. It gets really hot. They're pricey. I mean,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.720]   all saunas are pricey. All saunas are not cheap. You don't want to price shop for a sauna. If you
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.160]   do, there's some almost heaven saunas that go on sale every now and then at Costco. And that's
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.280]   probably the best deal. Do they get hot enough though? Almost heaven. Not quite. You're just
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.560]   buying the wood sauna and it comes with a heater. You can pick your heater. It is a good sauna in a
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.760]   reasonable price range. The thing that I don't love is these barrel saunas. They look really
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.200]   cool. They're way cheaper. And then the more you do your research, it's just so hard to make a
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.560]   barrel sauna work to get your feet above the rocks and get the heat. And so that's one of the things
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.160]   I learned going down the rabbit hole. Look, is a barrel sauna better than no sauna? Yeah, for sure.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.440]   If I had to choose between a barrel sauna and no sauna, I'd take it every day. But if you're
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.640]   going to go down the rabbit hole. Also, I mean, you have to consider this an investment in your
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.720]   health too. You know what I mean? This is not just something that you're blowing cash for the sake of
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.000]   blowing cash. It truly is going to improve your health over the long term. For me, it's an expense
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.960]   that's worth taking on. Yeah. So I'll put links to the show notes to what Haven did,
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.560]   because I think it's cool, especially if you don't have 240. Because I think even the plunge when you
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.080]   need 240, it's amazing. Okay. So you talked about self-care. I do have one question that I'm going
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.560]   to answer the question as well. Where do you get these ideas? Rope training. Where did you find
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.720]   that? It's not something I've heard really anyone ever talk about. Yeah. I mean, I have a little
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.600]   community forum over at KevinRose.com where people hang out and they post inside of that private
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.840]   little group. Somebody had posted a link to this guy's YouTube channel and we can link it up as
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:18.640]   well. He just talks about fascia work and he's a black belt in jujitsu. He's amazing. I'm always
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.200]   skeptical of new stuff and new people that are coming on the scene. And so I sent it over to Tim
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.640]   Ferris and Tim did some research and he's like, "Hey, actually, I trained with this guy one time
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.440]   randomly like a decade ago. This guy's legit. Let's go in deeper here." And I know he's been
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.920]   looking at, they call it more functional type movement health. And so we kind of both did a
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.720]   little bit more research and realize that he's recommending some pretty sound stuff. I don't
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.120]   want to speak for Tim. I don't know that he's doing any of this stuff, but I'm certainly starting it
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:55.520]   up. And I'm a fan of trying something new. Worst case, you give it a shot for a couple of months,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.560]   you literally have to buy a rope. If you don't want to buy one of the crazy, because they have
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.120]   nice ropes that are like 50 bucks, right? Really well-made, they're going to last you a decade.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.480]   He's like, "If you just want to give this a try, go down to Home Depot, get a $12 rope
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.800]   and go practice with my free course for the first three months and see if it's for you."
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.320]   And so that's one thing that I was just drawn to. And so far, I do feel like I'm getting a little
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.600]   bit more flexibility. And then also I noticed that I'm getting sore in places where I don't
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.680]   normally get sore, which I like because that means those little muscles are getting stressed
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.720]   in ways that they weren't before. I love that. Yeah. You didn't say it,
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.480]   and I will. When we have free time, it's just chasing random things. If I look, I wrote down
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.560]   some notes. I was like, "First thing I want to do is just clear out all the inbox text." The
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.960]   way my brain works is knowing I have things that I need to do makes it hard to just let go and go
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.200]   down the rabbit hole and do the research. So I'm like, "Clear out that, go for a run or get a
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.560]   workout in, and then go down some rabbit holes." Yeah. Rabbit holes for me are my favorite thing
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.480]   in the world. And they're also dangerous. Last night is a great example. So you can probably
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.240]   tell my voice, I'm recovering from a little bit of a cold. I was in a rabbit hole till 11.50 at
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:13.040]   night. And I'm supposed to meet you early this morning. And I was researching this new type of
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.840]   high bandwidth memory that's only used in AI chips. And NVIDIA uses them, AMD uses them,
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.800]   all the big AI providers that are building these GPUs to train all these AI models.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.080]   And I'm like, "Ooh, if I can find out which publicly traded companies are the suppliers
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.400]   that are providing this, that's an investment opportunity." And I'm going so deep. And I'm
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.040]   having AI do all the deep due diligence and research for me. And I'm like, "What am I doing?"
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.360]   It's midnight. But it just shows you when you get geeky about something. That can be anything,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   right? You just go down this rabbit hole. It doesn't even have to be for myself.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.560]   Sometimes my mom's like, "Oh, we're going to Scottsdale. We're trying to find a place for
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.280]   dinner." I'm like, "I am going to find the best place that my parents will have the best time."
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.720]   Why am I spending an hour going down everything? I just can't help. I enjoy it. It's just fun.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.120]   Can I give you a hack that I think is probably my number one thing that I've picked up in the
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.920]   last three months that I absolutely recommend to everyone? I haven't told you about this yet.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.320]   Okay.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.440]   It's going to be very obvious, but I just want to give you a couple examples.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.720]   So we all know that chat GPT has a voice interface, right? You can talk to it now
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.520]   and you can interrupt it now, which is quite nice, right? So you don't have to wait for it
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.320]   to finish this whole long sentence because it's like, "But wait a second. Tell me a little bit
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.480]   more about this." So you can tie that to your iPhone on that extra button that they have.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:28.720]   Already done.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.760]   So you can hold it down. Already done. And we ask it questions throughout the day. Like,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.240]   "Tell me about this. Tell me about that," right? But one thing I realized that is really fun
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:43.120]   is if you just go outside, sit on your patio one day and think about a topic that you know
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.480]   very little about, but are curious about, but you'd be embarrassed to ask an expert about because you
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:54.720]   would be so behind the curve. It would just be a lot of work and embarrassing to ask really dumb
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.240]   questions, right? So for me, that was quantum computing. And so I'm like, "Okay, I've heard
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.880]   about qubits. I heard that when you observe them, they collapse. How do they even write
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.880]   the algorithms? What is observing them? Is it lasers?" And so I sat there for 45 minutes
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.160]   with Chad GVT. And I was like, "Tell me about this. Tell me about this." And I have a voice
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.920]   training. It's a female voice. She's British. She sounds very nice. This is what I tell her.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.960]   "But you're explaining this at a college level. Give it to me at a ninth grader level." She's
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.480]   like, "Okay, cool." At a ninth grader level, I would explain it like this, right? And I got it.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.040]   After 45 minutes, I now have a really solid foundational understanding of quantum computing,
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.520]   what it means to add more qubits, what it means to observe different states,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.760]   and how they collapse into a result. And I didn't know any of that before.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.120]   And then I was talking to my buddy, Jeff, who works with me over at True Ventures,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.320]   and he was like, "When I'm cooking, I give my recipe to Chad GVT. And then as I'm cracking
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.480]   eggs and doing stuff, I'm telling it what I'm doing. And I'm asking questions like,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.280]   'Hey, should I add salt now or later? What if I did a squeeze of lemon? How does that impact
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.680]   the flavor profile for this? What's the chemical reaction process that makes the flavor profile
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.200]   different? Or my soup's a little bit flat. What if I did this?'" And it's training him to be a
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.840]   better cook and chef in real time. And in my head, I'm like, "All this sounds very obvious."
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.600]   But when you realize that that is the unlock, it is now a chance and opportunity for us
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.760]   to take all of these little things that we have surface level expertise at
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.920]   and not be afraid to ask the dumb questions. It's amazing. And so I'm doing that on a whole slew of
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.280]   different topics. So I've also started doing this a little, but when I'm driving, it's a great time.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.600]   You're in the car and I'm like, "Hey, my daughter asked about whales. I don't really know anything
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.120]   about whales. Give me a 20-minute lesson on everything I should ever know about whales."
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.360]   You went to that whale penis museum. Don't cut this out.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.960]   I did go to the Icelandic phallogical museum. There is an entire museum. I think it is the
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.520]   largest collection in the world. Of whale penises.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.760]   Whale penis was the largest one. I sent a picture because you can stand next to a photo of how big
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.800]   it is. But I think there were like 500 animal penises in this museum. It's nuts.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.120]   This episode is brought to you by Masterclass. I have learned so much about everything from
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.320]   communication to leadership to negotiation from business experts on this show. But if you're like

[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.680]   hours of your time each week. So I guess you're talking about AI tools.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.960]   Yeah. What AI tools are you using on a daily basis?
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.680]   Every week's a new tool. It's changing that fast. But I can tell you what my stack is now,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.840]   but by the time this comes out, it'll be three new things.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.800]   I know. This is a problem. I had this thing on the wall. I was like, "Let's do an episode on AI
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.720]   tools." And then I was like, "Oh, well, the next week, there's a new one." What are some tools
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.320]   you're using? It might be out of date. But then how are you staying on top of it? And how are
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.680]   you thinking about it? I think that if you can expense it,
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:06.160]   the $199 Pro version of ChatGPT is worth every penny, largely because you get early access to
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.240]   the models. And it has deep research. Well, they added that now recently for other users as well.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:19.760]   But when you hear about these new models that are coming out, we're shifting into this really weird
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.680]   world where when AI first came out, we thought it was going to be all you can eat for $20 a month.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.880]   Where it was like, "Okay, Gemini is $20 a month. ChatGPT is $20 a month. Claude is $20 a month."
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.120]   All the big foundational models. We're moving into a world where
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:43.920]   there are specific models that will go a lot deeper and give you much richer reports and
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:49.120]   insights. And they need more compute to do that. Basically, Sam Altman came out recently and said,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.960]   "Hey, even on our $199 a month plan, we're losing money." Because some of these models,
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.920]   when you ask it a deep research question, and it comes back and it spends two and a half minutes
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.880]   researching something and computing something for you, that's a very expensive query because of all
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.680]   the resources that are tying up while you're doing that. But the reports that come back are just
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:15.920]   unbelievable. Now, Google is giving away their deep research for $20 a month. So I think if I
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:21.760]   only had $20 a month to spend, I would do it at Gemini because I believe you're getting better
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:28.080]   models per dollar at Gemini. For me, if you're looking for just someone to be a writing companion
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.440]   slash someone that is going to give you and present you data back in a very
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:39.440]   friendly, non-technical way, Claude feels very elegant to me, which I kind of like because if
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:45.040]   I'm like, "Hey, rephrase this 20 different ways so I can finish this email," Claude, for some reason,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:51.120]   just gives me better responses than the more technical, clinical-sounding responses I get
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.000]   from some of the other models. But you have to go and play. For me, my stack is the big three,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.680]   like I mentioned. And then I would add in Notebook LM is fun because you can dump in a bunch of
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.600]   different PDFs. You can make podcasts of those PDFs. So for example, I recently had a home fire,
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.240]   house burned down. I dumped in my insurance policies into Notebook LM. And I said, "Hey,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.600]   what are my coverages? Explain this to me. My agent is coming back and saying this isn't covered.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.400]   By the letter of these PDFs, should I push back here?" And it's like, "Yes, you should push back
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:29.920]   here." And I did. And I did. And I did to multiple models. But I will say that where Notebook really
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.880]   excels, and that's a great point, is when you have a PDF and you want to understand it during a
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.280]   commute. So for example- The podcast feature.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.040]   Yes, exactly. So I'll take a Nature article that Nature is notorious for, one, being the best
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:48.960]   scientific journal in the world, two being because they are the geekiest, most hardcore journal in
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.120]   the world. I once bought a Nature subscription to the magazine when I was younger. You walk into
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.000]   somebody's house and you see Nature on the table and you're like, "Ooh, they're smart." It's like,
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.680]   "I want that." Yeah, exactly. It's like having the New Yorker or something on your desk. But
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.600]   I didn't understand a damn thing that was in there, very little, because it was very technical.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.320]   But you can drop a Nature PDF in there and tell the podcast host, "Break this down at a high school
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.920]   level and give me a 15-minute podcast about it." And then you're on your commute, you're consuming
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.400]   something, you're understanding it and- You can interrupt it now.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   Yeah. I demoed this the other day to someone
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.600]   where it's like, not only can you listen to it, but you can ask, "Hey, can you go a little deeper?"
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.280]   Right. And Eleven Labs also, I will say, in my opinion, is worth checking out. I've
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.800]   had a few conversations with the CEO. They have me under NDA over there and I've seen some of the
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.200]   future. Obviously, I'm not going to say what it is, but the future is bright for them. They have
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   some cool shit they're working on. Yeah. So all these are fundamental
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.800]   models. You go in and for anyone who hasn't tried these, go try them all. It's a chat interface.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.760]   You can usually add attachments. They can do searches and all this stuff. So that's AI tools,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.480]   part one. But I would say the key piece, the key takeaway, no matter what, for everyone out there,
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:09.200]   is these next, call it three to five years, it is not about saying, "I am using ChatGPT."
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.000]   It's about saying, "I am playing with everything that is coming out and staying on top of that."
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Because it is so rapidly evolving. For you to win, and when I mean win, I mean have a deep
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.800]   understanding of where things are going. It's going to be about that play, that exploration,
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.760]   that using and picking at all the edges and trying all the different tools.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:36.000]   And what about not model tools? All of these companies, startups that have built things
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.560]   on top of these models, Repl.it, Cursor, a lot of these scheduling ones, are using any of those?
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.600]   Yeah. Repl.it, Bolt is another one. Those are great for non-coders.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.960]   They're tools that allow you to basically create software.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.840]   That's right.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.680]   Just for anyone who doesn't know, you could basically say, "Oh,
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.560]   build me a tool that does this thing." And they'll build the tool.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:03.520]   I would put them in the 80% camp in terms of them being good. Things still break,
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.160]   and sometimes you run into a dead end where it can't fix it and you got to roll back the code.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.960]   They're worth playing with and that you can go there and say,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.240]   "Hey, build me an e-commerce website that does X, Y, and Z," or "Make me an app that does this."
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.160]   It's worth seeing that you don't have to be a coder and you can just
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.200]   explain something via a prompt. And then actually with Bolt and these others and Repl.it,
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.080]   you can click one click deploy and make it a public website. And then you can attach a domain
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.640]   to it. So there was one time basically I wanted to bridge two systems together. I just explained
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.840]   what I wanted to do. It built the tool for me. I deployed it and it worked and it was fine. It's
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.960]   not there yet in that you're not building and deploying native iOS apps that are complex.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.000]   For my coder friends, they love it because it gets them 80% of the way there and then they can
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.640]   fill out the rest on their own because they know how to code. But in the next five years,
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.200]   that's going to be a solved problem. And I would not be studying computer science right now
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.760]   as a major if I had to... When people come up and say, "Hey, what should I be doing? I'm about
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.160]   to go into college." Computer science to me, I would say, "Yes, if you're more on the science
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:18.640]   side and you want to be pushing frontier models and you're math heavy. Less so if you just want
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.400]   to be a software engineer that writes iOS apps, because that's going to be a solved problem with
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.600]   AI." Yeah, it's wild. I didn't do this, but I think if I bring the gift card side I built back
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.120]   online for the next rev, I was like, "That's a perfect use case. I need something that just
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.920]   does simple order fulfillment, generate a CSV, send an email to a person, all that kind of stuff."
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.960]   One that I played with... And it's funny because I also wouldn't want to be investing in a lot of
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.000]   the companies building consumer use cases because it seems like all of these model companies are
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.560]   just launching them. So I really liked this app, Simple AI. And you could download it and you could
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.360]   say, "Hey, call these five restaurants and see if they have a table for seven tonight for walk-ins."
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.880]   Yeah. We invested at True Ventures. It's one of our companies, yeah.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.120]   Yeah. So here's my question. Now, Gemini or Google just launched half these features.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.240]   What happens to a lot of these companies? First off, it's awesome. If you want to call a store
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.760]   and ask if they have something in stock because they don't have a website, you now have a tool
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.040]   that will do that for you for free. Simple AI, I actually think is a better interface than what I
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.440]   saw Google launch. But Google also wants to launch something like this, especially for restaurant
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.040]   reservations. What happens for a lot of these consumer apps that are built on these models?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.840]   I think there's a couple of things to consider here. One is that Google is a massive company,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.560]   as is Microsoft, as is all the bigs that are in this space. They have a ton of resources.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:40.720]   We've worked at Google together. We understand that the beast can be amazing in that they can
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.600]   sometimes spit out very unique, novel, fun things, Waymo. I remember when we checked out Google Glass
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.120]   for the first time way back in the day. I still have my Google Glass.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.880]   Do you really? Yeah. I don't know if it works.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:58.960]   They can spin up fun, wild little incubators internally that do cool things. But ultimately,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:04.560]   once you get outside of that bubble, I feel that the independent entrepreneur oftentimes is much
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.920]   more creative than the big corporation. I don't think it's a winner-take-all. Google may very
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.280]   well develop that feature, and you could have three other startups that have built the same
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.240]   thing. And then Microsoft comes along and is like, "Damn, we needed that yesterday." $300
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.960]   million, I'll take that company, and they just take it out of the market.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.520]   Then you have a lot of other companies where it's important to remember that
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.720]   every time something is launched at a big, meaning like a Google, Microsoft, whatever,
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:39.200]   there are companies that do not and cannot host their data there because of either competitive
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.400]   reasons or whatever it may be. I think the best example here is probably Dropbox. Everyone thought
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.520]   Dropbox was going to be completely crushed when Google Drive came out. And now there's Microsoft
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:56.880]   OneDrive, there's Box, there's all these other players. But Dropbox is a beautiful third party
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.960]   outside of those ecosystems that is used by millions of people.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:08.640]   So I just don't believe in a winner-take-all. If I was personally building in this space,
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.000]   I would try to avoid the areas where the bigs are going to go because they are very powerful and
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.640]   they can crush you if they put enough resources against it. For me, when I'm looking from an
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:24.960]   investment standpoint, I would much rather try and look at maybe mental health as applied to AI,
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.600]   or drug discovery as applied to AI in some unique way, or just areas where,
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.360]   if you're Google and Microsoft, it's not the immediate first thing that you're going to go
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:40.800]   after. They're going to get and understand documents, email, all of their core workspace
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.160]   assets are going to be AI-enabled. Yeah, the core things they do now,
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.360]   book a flight, make a reservation, things that are front and center, find the directions,
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.840]   they're going to do that. And also, they own the metal.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.320]   And when you own the metal, it's hard to get consumers to switch. And when I own the metal,
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:04.160]   I mean, they own the actual OS at the device level. So when users have Gemini in every single
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:10.800]   Android phone, and it's bundled into everything that you do, it's very hard to convince consumers
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.440]   to switch to another party when they're paying for it. The average consumer, there will be lots
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:22.080]   of people that do, but it's just like any other service. Remember when we used to get our internet
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.400]   bundled with our TV, bundled with our phone, were you going to go out and get a third-party phone
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.360]   service? And you're like, "No, everything's together. I'm paying $75, done." And so,
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.400]   Apple has that advantage, even though Apple Intelligence sucks, it will not forever.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   Apple has a lot of money to throw at this problem. My gut tells me that Microsoft launches a phone
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:48.480]   that is Android powered, but co-pilot backend powered sometime in the next year.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.720]   Okay. A couple other tools that I've been using. So Zapier, I think there's all these people
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.280]   building these products that do various one-off things. But Zapier has the ability to both tie
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   into all of your apps and integrate LLMs. So you can basically say, "Oh, if I get an email with an
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:13.760]   attachment, put the attachment through some model, summarize it, and send an email to me about it."
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.120]   Why would you use Zapier versus IFTTT versus Make versus all of the others?
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.640]   To me, IFTTT is like a thing of the past.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.840]   A thing of the past. Okay.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.480]   I know Make exists and I've seen it, but I'm already familiar with Zapier. I already have
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.560]   things tied into it. I understand the way it works. So there are probably multiple tools to do this.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.160]   I've heard good things about Make. I haven't tried it yet.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.000]   I have too, but it's like I'm already in this ecosystem. I already pay my subscription fee.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.120]   But the ability to basically say, "If this thing happens, use a model and then do this other thing.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.920]   If you see something on my calendar, look at the person that's on the invite
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.560]   and go online and do some research and add their bio to the calendar invite."
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.120]   Those kinds of things, there will be all these agents that do this that tie into everything
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.160]   one day. And there are one-off tools for each of these use cases that you can pay for.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.440]   But I've also found that if you're willing to just roll your sleeves up a little,
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.120]   you could kind of dream up your own use case and create these things.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.840]   And then Zapier has their own model or AI tool that's like, "Hey, build me a
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.400]   Zap that does these things and it will tie in." So that's one where if you don't want to go play,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.280]   there's one called Howie, I think, which summarizes some... I can't remember all the
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.880]   use cases. I wrote them all down. I forgot.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.000]   Yeah. I think that what you're saying, I really like the idea that... And I've used this with
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.880]   Zapier where you can describe what you want it to do with AI, and then it goes and builds it.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.920]   It's just a faster way to get these apps to work, which is...
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.240]   Exactly.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.560]   We just added that in the last few months. So it's been great.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.160]   So I had one where it was like in Notion, we're tracking sponsors, and then it can go create some
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.280]   draft invoices in Stripe. You can just do all of these things. But now you have the ability to
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:48.880]   interject a model, which is like, "Anytime I forward an email with an attachment, summarize
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.040]   it and respond." So if someone's like, "Hey, here's a book summary. What do you think?"
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.960]   Forward it, and I get a response. I don't even have to think about it. I can even set up a Gmail
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.640]   filter where if it's in this label, do this and all that kind of stuff.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.880]   We have this tool on the VC side to let you know how crazy it's getting. There is a tool where you
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:10.640]   can take any pitch deck you want and upload it to it. And then it goes out and it finds
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.040]   competitors to that pitch deck. It tells you the total addressable market for what they're pitching.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.480]   It tells you the strength of the founders, and it crawls LinkedIn and does all the other crazy
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:25.200]   stuff. And it gives you back this full-blown summary overview article of all the due diligence
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.480]   that you would typically do within a minute and a half. It's nice.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.640]   That's nice. So I'd say anyone listening, my goal is to go play with a lot more of these
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.960]   and then record a solo episode, get it out pretty fast because things are changing,
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.920]   with some feedback on what I've gotten from using them. I haven't used them all.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.200]   So if anyone listening is like, "Oh, here's this tool I love. Send me an email,
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.960]   podcast@allthehacks.com. I'll play with it. We'll go a little deeper." Are there any other
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.960]   things that you're using on a daily or weekly basis that are not the models themselves?
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.360]   Yeah. I like Snipped. I think Snipped is probably my favorite podcast app right now,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:04.080]   and largely because what it does is they process every single podcast through an AI model,
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.920]   and they break it into logical chunks. So before, if you went to a podcast, I'm sure you've seen
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.320]   this, you'd go to the show notes, and sometimes they would link up the actual areas of topics of
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:20.080]   conversation where you could jump into them. Now what they've done is because of AI, you can go in
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.200]   and they break it into these different chunks. They're shareable, and then you can quickly save
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.440]   something. So I'll give you an example. Back in the day in Audible, I'd be listening to audiobook,
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.800]   and I'd be like, "Oh, that was a great little piece," right? And then you go back, you quick
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   grab your phone, and you click bookmark, and it's like your in point and out point for the place
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.600]   that you want to share. And you're like, "Okay, in point, I'll drag a little bit further." And
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.920]   it was like a five-minute process to get that little clip that you wanted to save, right?
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.000]   And so what they do is they know that it takes you a few seconds to get to your phone. And they're
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.040]   like, "We think this was the clip that you really were curious about." And then I can press one tap
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.480]   to send it out to Bear, to Notion, to any of those other places. Now I have that saved. It gives me a
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:04.960]   link to the actual audio piece of it as well. So I have the data in case I want to do something
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.320]   actionable on it. I can set it to do, I can do whatever I want there. And then I can click
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.680]   through to it and listen to it again or share it with a friend. And then because the SNPs are
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:19.760]   social, I can see this most SNPed areas of the podcast. So I can be like, "Oh, Chris has launched
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.840]   a new All the Hacks episode. This one was SNPed 300 times." And by the way, people are SNPing the
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.400]   crap out of your episodes. I know, I've seen it. I met the SNP founder. Yeah, he's awesome.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.760]   It was really interesting. The only thing that... I just don't know what happens with the future of
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   podcasts when AI summarizes everything. The one thing that is nice is we're going to turn...
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   Podcasts are quickly going to convert into conversations. And it probably will be in your
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.800]   voice. So today you could launch your own app that is All the Hacks. And you could be like,
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.680]   "Let me tell you about this great deal." And I'd be like, "Hey, Chris, well, wait a second. Didn't
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.880]   you say a couple of episodes ago that this was 7% off?" And you would respond back being like,
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.560]   "That's a great point, Kevin. I did say that a couple of episodes ago. It was a minute number,
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.880]   blah, blah, blah." And that's all 11 labs powering your voice. And I would not know that it's not
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.040]   you. It's going to be wild. And that's going to be applied to books. That's going to be applied
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.120]   to everything. And this is just right around the corner. This episode is brought to you by
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.720]   Built Rewards, which is an amazing points program with so many ways to earn, including on your rent,
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.880]   where you don't even need to check with your landlord. So let me explain. First, there's no
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.280]   cost to join Built. And as a member, you'll earn valuable points on rent and on your everyday
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.920]   spending. Built points can be transferred to your favorite hotels and airlines, and even the ones
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:35.760]   you haven't heard of. There are over 500 airlines and 700,000 hotels and properties around the world
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.840]   you can redeem your Built points toward. Points can be redeemed towards a future rent payment and
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.960]   unique experiences that only Built members can access. So if you're not earning points on rent,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.760]   my question is why not? Start earning points on rent you're already paying by going to
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:57.200]   chrishutchins.com/built. That's chrishutchins.com/built, B-I-L-T. Make sure to use our URL
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.320]   so they know we sent you chrishutchins.com/built or the link in the description to start earning
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.440]   points on your rent payments today. This episode is brought to you by Delete.me. And if you prefer
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.680]   not to have your identity stolen or have your phone number, home address, or email showing up
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.000]   all over the internet, you really need to check out Delete.me this year. Unfortunately, there's
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.280]   hundreds of data brokers online that are constantly sharing and selling your personal info and keeping
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.760]   track of all of them is like playing whack-a-mole. But fortunately, if you go to them one by one,
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.680]   you can get them to remove your data. However, that process can take hours and hours to do yourself.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:37.520]   I know I tried it two years ago and after spending more than 10 hours and not even getting close to
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.800]   finishing, I gave up and started using Delete.me and I haven't looked back. Since then, I've signed
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.600]   up my entire family because Delete.me will not just find and remove your personal info from
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:52.640]   hundreds of data broker websites, they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:58.160]   which sadly happens all the time, and get that removed as well. On average, they find and remove
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.600]   over 2,000 pieces of personal info for a customer in their first two years. And to date, they've
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:09.360]   done over 100 million data removals for customers. So if you want your personal information removed
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:16.400]   from the web, go to chrishutchins.com/deleteme and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.120]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com/deleteme or click the link in the description.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.880]   So the only other area of AI tools, are you using anything to record meetings?
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.840]   Granola is the best. I like it because it sits outside of everything.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.600]   They are working on some functionality to let people know that you are recording them because
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.480]   you do have to get consent to record people. In some states, right?
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.800]   In some states, yeah. But it's just generally good practice. But it sits outside of everything,
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.360]   meaning that you install it at the OS level. So if you're doing a Google Meet, a Zoom,
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:49.680]   Google Hangout, any other meetings that you're doing anywhere, you can grab like a FaceTime audio
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:55.840]   call. And so it detects that audio has happened and it launches as, "Do you want to record this?"
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.680]   And it creates these beautiful summaries, transcripts. You can ask questions of the
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.960]   meeting afterwards. And I think it's like 10 bucks a month. It's granola.ai. I'm not an
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.040]   investor. I would love to have been, but I think it's one of the best out there.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.760]   There's one called Limitless. And they both have a service like that that runs at the OS level.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.280]   And then they're about to ship like a pendant that you can wear throughout the day that would
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.800]   like turn on a light. Oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.920]   And it's coming soon. And you'd wear it all day and record everything you do. It would have a
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.880]   light so people would know. Granola is going to have an app so you can just launch the app. Like
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.920]   we were just sitting here having a conversation. I can just launch it and be like, boom. And then
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:36.080]   it would just record all of us. The only issue with granola, I will say one thing. I tried Zoom's
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:41.280]   AI and I love it. I actually think it creates great summaries afterwards. And the nice thing
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.840]   about Zoom, because it is built into the app, it understands who's talking. So it'll be like,
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:51.040]   "Oh, Chris said this." And not that granola wouldn't understand there's two distinct voices.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.320]   But it doesn't know who they are.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:59.760]   It can try because if there is a calendar invite and it's you and me, it will know one of us is
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.880]   Chris and one's Kevin. But if there's like four people on the calendar invite, it sure as shit
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:10.480]   doesn't know who's who, right? But Zoom does know. And so you can say like, "Hey, Chris mentioned
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.760]   this, blah, blah, blah," to Zoom and then get much better data from Zoom if you're doing it built in.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.920]   Okay. So a lot of AI tools changing every day. You talked about your house. I want to come back
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.120]   because I got a question from someone that was about, in light of the recent fires,
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.960]   what should I be doing to make sure that if I'm ever in a situation like you were in,
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:36.480]   I can be prepared? So I did my research. I have some thoughts. But I'm curious,
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.120]   maybe you could talk a little about your experience of the whole thing.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:48.000]   Yeah. Our house was taken by the LA fires. And at the end of the day,
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:54.960]   just grateful that family's safe, dog safe, all that stuff is good. Grabbed a handful of things.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.920]   But in retrospect, when you look back at what was lost, it was the sentimental stuff at the
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:05.040]   end of the day that I think is the biggest hit. All the other crap is just stuff. And honestly,
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:13.440]   sometimes it's kind of nice to not have that stuff. In a really weird way to go back and
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:20.000]   have a mental reboot on what is important to you from just the things that I consume and hold on to
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   is a very refreshing thing to go through. And I would say that the things I wish I would have done,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:37.120]   one thing I was very lucky to have done was that I took all my photos that I had in a box about six
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.800]   months ago and sent them out to a third party service and had them all scanned in. These were
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.360]   old slides that my dad had, stuff like that. So I have all that stuff saved on cloud drive,
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.480]   which is huge. Never took photos of my first father's day cards and stuff for my kids where
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.560]   they were spelling their names wrong and stuff like that. That stuff hits me hard. Lost that
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.200]   stuff. Never took photos of the stuff that my dad left me. He made me a little jewelry box
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:05.120]   when I was a little kid that was burned up. He made me a little desk. He was a woodworker. He
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:12.320]   loved doing that kind of stuff. Made me a little desk that I used to sit at that was lost. Things
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:17.360]   like that, you look back on it and you're like, there was no way I could have carried that desk
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:22.080]   out, nor would I have had the fire still been happening. So I would have lost it regardless.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.000]   But it would have been nice to have had a photo of it in a strange way just to be like, oh yeah,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.800]   that was that object. And so just going around taking photos that are huge, those types of
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.160]   sentimental things. My wife lost a lot of stuff that her parents are both past. And so she lost
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:44.240]   almost everything from that side, which was really devastating for her. Some key takeaways though,
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.360]   that are important for everyone. I had my crypto keys outside of my house, which is great,
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:54.160]   like pounded in steel in a safety deposit box. The safety deposit box was right down the street
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.960]   and the bank burned and like everything burned around it. The keys are fine, but move this
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.600]   shit a little further away. If you're going to have backups where your jewelry and your other
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:09.360]   things, you're moving stuff offsite, the important items, don't take it to the bank that's five
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:15.840]   blocks away. Because if you are in a place where there is that severe devastation, you want that
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:23.520]   to be miles away, not necessarily right next door. That is a good takeaway. The insurance policy
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:29.040]   stuff is huge. I mean, just getting additional riders on certain things. We had state coverage
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.600]   because we couldn't get coverage for our home for the longest time, which means we were severely
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   underinsured. Got really lucky in that I kept just like pushing and shopping around and eventually
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.880]   found someone to like pick up and add additional coverage about three months before the fires
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:48.240]   happened. So we were very lucky and fortunate in that way. But yeah, I mean, those were the
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:53.520]   big things. And then just honestly keeping the receipts because you do have to itemize stuff
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:41:01.200]   afterwards. And does that mean like you're going through and I had 17 t-shirts and 12 pairs of
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.720]   socks and here's where I bought them? Like at what level did it get to? So basically what they're
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.280]   going to do is you're going to have a dwelling coverage and then you're going to have an inside
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.720]   of the dwelling coverage, right? Your items, right? Let me give a quick run through because
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.000]   I did a little bit of research in my own policy. So there's four types of coverage that usually
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   come. Coverage A is dwelling. Yes. And that's to rebuild your house. And a lot of policies have an
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.040]   extended coverage. So let's say your home's worth a million dollars, you could insure it for a
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.120]   million and then you could get like a 25% boost or a 50% boost. So on USAA, it's called Home
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:41.440]   Protector Plus. Yeah. And one tip that I want to share, which I'm sure people as they rebuild in
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:47.040]   LA are going to realize, I know a lot of people are like a house is worth a million. So I don't
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:53.040]   need to get a full million in coverage. I can get like 700 grand in coverage and then get the 50%
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:59.840]   boost, which will take it to a million, 50,000. And so they use the Home Protector to give that
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.920]   boost. One of the realities I know is going to happen in LA is like, however much you thought
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.720]   it cost to build a house in LA is going to be significantly more expensive right now because
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.760]   the shortage of supplies, the shortage of builders. So I would... 20% to 30% on change orders and
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.960]   everything else alone is going to be on top of that for sure. So I would encourage people
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:23.040]   not to rely on that extended dwelling coverage to get to the value of their home, which I know a lot
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.280]   of people do. I would encourage people to ensure the value of the home and then have the extended
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.960]   coverage be the, "Oh, I forgot to increase my policy with inflation. Oh, something happened,
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:38.000]   more natural disaster and the cost is all gone up." Yeah. And so that's one important takeaway.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.360]   Also, I would add on top of that, it's something that's important to consider and talk to your
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:48.160]   insurance agent about this, is that we had this additional external hardscapes like coverage,
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.720]   which was like a little extra policy that went above and beyond the actual dwelling coverage.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.920]   And where that came into play for us is when your house burns to absolute just nothing,
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:04.080]   you've got... I had lithium ion like power walls and shit and like all that stuff that is just
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:10.880]   toxic in the ground. It's your responsibility to remove all that rubble, to detoxify it,
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.400]   and you have to actually have a third party come in and certify that the ground is now
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:22.000]   toxin-free. So they go down about a foot and look for toxins. And that policy for us covered all of
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.280]   that removal and resurfacing of the land to make it livable. So even if you don't want to rebuild,
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.600]   you have to sell that land in that working condition. And you just want to make sure that
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.520]   that coverage is going to be there for you. Yeah. So then there's coverage B is other
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:43.200]   structures. And the way most policies work is it's some percentage of dwelling. So at USAA,
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:50.000]   it's 10 to 100%. And this covers your sheds, patios, ADUs, pools, fences, driveways, sidewalks,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.120]   all that kind of stuff. Then coverage C is your personal belongings. And for our policy,
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:01.920]   you can choose between 50 and 75% of your dwelling limits. For some reason, all of the coverage BCD
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.480]   are usually sliders based on your dwelling. You can't kind of choose an arbitrary number.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.320]   Typically, there's no riders. Yes. Yes. But the average policy with State Farm,
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:16.560]   with USAA, you don't say, "I want 400,000 of this." You typically, and every insurance provider is
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.560]   different, you say, "I want 50% of my dwelling covered." So let me give you a little hack here
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:26.960]   on the C stuff. So my agent said C, the inside items. Yeah. Personal belongings.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.920]   Personal belongings, he described it as this, which I thought was a great,
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.120]   just a perfect analogy for it. He's like, "If I were to take your home,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.040]   I would pick it up off the ground. I would shake it." He's like, "Anything that falls out
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:43.600]   would be considered those personal belongings." Now, I had probably, to my detriment,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:50.480]   installed speakers in my ceilings and all that stuff. And he's like, "Those are hard attached.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:56.640]   Those are attached to your home, like in a way that you, if you were to, you couldn't remove
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:02.320]   them without causing damage to the home. So we have to include that in the main dwelling.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.520]   And if you hit your cap there, then they're not covering the speaker." So I hit my cap on the
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.440]   dwelling. So they're like, "Oh, you're out the cost of speakers. The electronics are related
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:19.280]   to that stuff that it was hard mounted." So it's actually to your benefit to get sound bars and
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.680]   stuff that isn't- Now, if it's mounted to the wall-
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.720]   Then you'll be okay with that if it's mounted to the wall. But just remember,
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.880]   if you're going and doing that dream 7.1 surround sound system where it's all put into the wall and
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.560]   all that, they are not going to include that as- As a personal belonging.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.600]   As a personal belonging. It's part of your dwelling.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.520]   It's part of your dwelling. Sauna, part of your dwelling. There's all these little things,
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.760]   home automation systems, part of your dwelling. Just always think about that. Like, do I really-
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.520]   The kitchen upgrades, the fridge, the ovens, all those remodels.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.320]   Do I need the crest on system or that, you know, there's all these fancy systems as you start to
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.480]   kind of go up the chain for home automation. My next place, eventually, wherever it is,
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.720]   I'm just living in an apartment right now, is not going to have all that crap. Like, screw that.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.240]   Or you could just have more dwelling coverage.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:07.440]   Yeah. But also, honestly, dude, it's like, it's just more to worry about. There's all
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.840]   these little micro things that sit with you. Like, one of my colleagues was talking to me
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:17.120]   about how do you rethink about buying stuff back, right? And one of the things I realized is I would
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.720]   do a lot of donations where I'd like go every year and I'd be like, "Oh, it's spring cleaning time.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.960]   Let's go and donate a bunch of stuff." It's mostly clothes and things like that, whatever.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.640]   But there are these things that like, if I were to look around this room, I probably could pick
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.160]   out like, you know, five or six different things where, especially electronics. Like,
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.680]   if you donate something that's like $250 or $300, like it's going to sit in a goodwill and no one's
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.600]   going to actually use it. They're not going to know how to install it. Like, it's probably going
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:48.560]   to be wasted, right? Or you can put it on eBay, right? Do you want to take the time to eBay all
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.440]   this stuff? It's a pain in the ass sometimes. So, I was sitting on all this stuff that I one day
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:47:00.480]   would eBay that got all destroyed, right? And I don't need any of that stuff back. Like literally
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:07.440]   almost everything I'm wearing today was donated by a friend. And I'm like thinking of just really
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.720]   cutting back to the minimal lifestyle, man. We don't need all this crap. There's so much stuff
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:20.080]   we buy we don't need. Like just so much. I don't know. For me, it was a great mental reboot of
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:25.920]   what's important in life and how as, especially as Americans, we're just over consumers. I was
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.720]   a sucker for the freaking Instagram ad where it comes up and it's like, "Hey, this is a better
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.440]   all steel aluminum way to hold your travel pills for when you go like travel." I'm like, "Oh,
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.920]   that looks like a cool looking case. Buy random dumb shit." And like those days are...
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.280]   Yeah, we don't need those things.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:41.760]   No.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   Is there one thing... So, Ruth emailed me and asked, "What's kind of one of your favorite
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.400]   physical items or purchases? Is there something that was an expensive thing that you're like,
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.320]   "You know what? In our house now or our next house, I'm going to do that." There's a lot
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.840]   of stuff you said you're going to get rid of. Is there something where you're like,
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.200]   "That thing's still important."
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.320]   No. Can you think of anything?
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:07.680]   So, here are some of the things that I thought about. One was just a good Wi-Fi system.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.320]   But that's cheap. That's not expensive anymore.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.600]   Well, I think...
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.480]   You can get a good Wi-Fi 7 system for a few hundred dollars. Last time, I went a little
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:22.400]   crazy and I had a bomb-proof Wi-Fi system. And I wouldn't do that again.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.760]   I used to have the buy a router and get an extender and then did the run Ethernet to
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.600]   have Wi-Fi access points in different rooms. So, you have really good speed everywhere.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:36.560]   I thought that was worth it. It's probably all in under $1,000, but probably over $500.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.760]   But I think that's worth it still. I'm talking about like for me...
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.600]   The $10,000 home theater.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.960]   Anytime anything crosses a couple grand, you really have to sit back and say,
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.880]   "Did I need that?" I had a bunch of bottles of wine that were sitting there.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.960]   And they were nice bottles of wine. And they sat there for years and they aged and all that good
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:58.720]   stuff. And all those were lost and not covered because we hit our policy max. And so, we didn't
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:05.360]   have any more coverage there. And in my mind, I'm like, "Guess what? If I really think someday
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.800]   I have an event to celebrate, and I want a nice bottle of wine, I could just go buy a nice bottle
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:17.440]   of wine that day and be like, "There it is." I don't have to own it. I can just decide when I
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.880]   want it. And guess what? Those same dollars over the last decade would have been a hell of a lot
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:28.240]   better in pick your fun, crazy asset like Bitcoin or whatever else.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.760]   Or even VTI.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:34.240]   Yeah, exactly. I would have paid for the bottle three times over if it had just been in VTI.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.120]   That's amazing.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:40.640]   Yeah. My list of things that I really like, none of them were that expensive.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:46.800]   They were like, "I really like having a desktop computer in my office so that I just don't need
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.560]   to plug in the laptop. I can just run to the office." But that's hundreds of dollars. There's
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:56.160]   no really extravagant thing. And when I thought about all the items in the house, after you went
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.680]   through what you went through, I was like, "Oh, I would be okay losing most of them."
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:05.040]   But to the question we... Well, I'll do the last one, which was the coverage D is the loss of use,
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:09.360]   which is usually some percentage of your dwelling. And it covers, at least my policy,
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.920]   a year or in a catastrophe, two years of staying somewhere else.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.640]   Yeah, it's huge.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.000]   And so you're seeing that. It's covering your rental right now.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:23.040]   And so that's great. So going back to the question on personal belongings,
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.480]   one of the things that I've done and everyone I know says you should do
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.360]   is walk around your house every six months and just videotape everything. So you have
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.640]   some record of all your stuff.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:38.880]   Yeah. It's not for the insurance company, by the way. It can be as a backup. I'm sure every
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:45.520]   company varies. But what Cincinnati Insurance, which is who I'm with, which they've been a great
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:53.680]   provider, they didn't require that. They wanted just receipts. They wanted receipts and the show
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:00.960]   that I had bought said thing. But it is a good trigger to remind you what you actually owned.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.360]   Now, what if you didn't have receipts, though? What if you couldn't find the
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.080]   receipts from some clothing store?
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.320]   Well, I mean, everything's in email now. So you're going to find out.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.600]   Would a credit card statement count?
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.040]   They've been cool like that. I've shown credit card statements. Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:11.760]   Okay.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.280]   But I have to imagine everybody's a little bit different. There are some insurance companies
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.320]   are going to be super sticklers about this stuff. Cincinnati's been awesome so far.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.560]   Yeah. For a great example, when we bought this house,
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:27.120]   we negotiated that they leave in one of the TVs that they put in to stage it.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.480]   So I don't have the receipt for that TV. I don't even know if it's in the contract. We were just
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.600]   like, "Hey, if you can leave the TV." Having a video of it might help prove, "Yes, there was
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.000]   a TV on this wall." Do I know the exact model? For expensive stuff, I've been told, "Write down
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   the model, the serial number, that kind of stuff." But I would just say that is helpful both to jog
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.480]   your memory of all the stuff you own. And then second, some insurance companies, if you don't
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.720]   have receipts, it's good to be able to show them, "Hey, what is this thing on your wall? What is it
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:58.080]   worth?" And there is a coverage that I added called replacement cost coverage, which basically
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:02.960]   doesn't depreciate all this stuff. So it's like, if you bought a TV for 500 bucks, five years,
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:08.000]   what is it worth? And this policy, this kind of coverage that I added is like, "We're not going
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.880]   to try to figure out what it's worth. We're just going to look at what it costs to buy it now."
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.000]   Right. That's huge.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.320]   And so that was really big. And then one thing that's important on the personal belongings,
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:22.560]   there are a lot of things that have caps on coverage. Money is one, gold is one, jewelry,
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:28.720]   guns, watches, silver, gold, all this stuff. If you have anything that is really expensive or that
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.800]   falls into any of the categories I just said, you need separate riders. I don't even know if you can
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.480]   get a separate rider on money, but if you have a lot... I didn't have any of that, by the way.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.600]   You had gold, some gold. I know you had gold in your safe.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.560]   What's funny about it, I was talking to my... I called my wife on the phone. I said,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.320]   "Get out of the house." Well, I said, "First, go look and see how close the fire is." And she
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.520]   went outside. It's like, "It's freaking close." We have this little tiny safe. And I was like,
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:54.400]   "Just grab everything that's in there." And it was a small little thing. I had one gold bar,
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.800]   one little gold, tiny gold bar, because you fucking told me to buy it.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:03.360]   But other than that, I just had a few watches that were high value watches and a couple really
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.920]   sentimental ones that my dad had left me. And we didn't have riders on any of that stuff. So
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.040]   my wife left her wedding ring. We didn't have a rider on that. That burned in the fire.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:18.480]   She left her wallet there with all her stuff. She had a bunch of her jewelry that was
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.160]   some pretty nice stuff. And all that stuff was obviously lost.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.720]   Okay. Super helpful.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:30.640]   This episode is brought to you by Facet. Finding good and actionable financial advice is not easy,

[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.280]   So let me save you some time, because when I shut down my financial planning firm a few years ago,
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:44.240]   we did a ton of research on who to recommend to our clients, and we landed on Facet.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.960]   Facet makes professional financial advice actionable to everyone. And instead of charging
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.400]   a high percentage of your assets, they only charge a flat annual membership fee with investment

[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.640]   option is best for you. That's chrishutchins.com/facet.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.520]   Last question that I think we're going to cover here, because gosh, we have so many things. But
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.920]   work can be done from anywhere. Someone asked me, "You record a podcast. You can work anywhere.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.040]   Why are you living in a really high cost of living place?" And so my reaction,
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.720]   so I talked about this with Amy, because once she joined the podcast full-time, I was like,
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.280]   "Why? We live in one of the most expensive places in the world. Why do we do it? How do we evaluate
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   where we wanted to live?" Some of our criteria were we wanted access to good healthcare. So Amy
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.440]   has the BRCA2 mutation. She's gone through the double mastectomy. She wanted to be in a city
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.760]   near good healthcare. That narrowed it down a little. Do you really need to be in the city,
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.960]   though? Because you could fly into anywhere. You're right. You're right. And I think this
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.800]   is why I wanted to bring this question up with you, because all of these things seem to be
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:06.880]   somewhat justifications for, "We're already here and it's a lot of inertia to move because we've
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.320]   already bought a house. We've already done these things." So I'm going to ask you.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.640]   I can live almost anywhere. Honestly, I'd love to live in Tokyo if I had to pick any city. But
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.080]   there's a lot of work here for people that are in the technology industry. So obviously,
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:23.520]   the Bay Area is huge. LA, I don't think I would want to stay there long term. But we'll see.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:29.840]   That's a discussion to be had with your partner. Yeah. For me, it ultimately came down to one
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:37.280]   important thing was, "Let's not think about this decision of where we live based on just the cost."
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:43.440]   Because I could make an argument that will be very controversial that the Bay Area for someone
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:51.280]   like me and someone like my wife is the cheapest place to live in the country. Because the kinds
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.520]   of careers we went into -- business development, partnerships, starting companies, joining early
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:01.600]   stage companies, investing in startups -- all of those things, the opportunity we've had from just
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:07.440]   serendipity of living here has generated more returns than the savings we would have gotten
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.840]   living somewhere else. 100%. But you're at a point now where you've hit escape velocity.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:17.040]   It's not like you need more wealth. So I agree. So then the question is,
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:23.920]   what would you do with the money you would save living somewhere else? And is that savings worth
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.720]   what you get living here? So what you get living in the Bay Area, you get great weather
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.480]   from the weather I want. I'm sure there are people that are like, "I want snow all the time." This
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.720]   isn't great for them. For us, the weather is exactly what we want. The schools are a huge
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:42.240]   one for me. The schools are great. The people we are around, our friend group, have similar beliefs,
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:46.320]   similar ideas. We enjoy the conversations we have. People are super curious. They're
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.880]   always doing weird, interesting stuff. The community is great. There's excellent food.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:56.000]   We're close to an airport that has direct flights everywhere. Definitely don't get that in Austin.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.840]   So all those things come together. It's like the Bay Area is a great place to live, but it's
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:06.400]   expensive. But what would we use that savings for? And is that savings better than living where you
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:11.680]   want to live? And you and I probably have stuff. It's tough. And we have half a dozen friends,
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.600]   a couple, I don't know if you do, that moved to Puerto Rico and stuff. I talked to this guy who
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:19.920]   lives in Puerto Rico, sold his company. The taxes when you live in Puerto Rico are great. You just
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.120]   don't pay them. And he's like, "This is amazing." I was like, "Do you like Puerto Rico?" He's like,
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.760]   "No, I don't love living in Puerto Rico, but I save so much money." This was like a nine-figure
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:32.480]   exit, right? So maybe after taxes, it's eight figures. But this is a person with so much money
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:37.600]   living half the year. And he says he's probably going to be there for like seven or eight years.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.600]   I'm like, so you're putting at least, because you got to be there more than 50% of the year,
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:49.760]   like four or five of what is probably like 50 great adult years of your life. 10% of your adult
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:55.200]   life where you can do all the things you've given up to save some money on taxes. But you already
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.960]   have 50 plus million dollars. And obviously, most people listening don't have $50 million.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:07.120]   But I just push people to consider like moving to save money on taxes to a place that you don't
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:12.640]   love is not often, in my opinion, going to be the best outcome. Now, if you're living somewhere
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.600]   where you can't afford to put food on the table, you can't afford to provide for your family, well,
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.480]   then I think you might be better off living somewhere where you can do those things because
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:23.280]   the stress of that circumstance is something I can't even imagine. But when I see people say,
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.120]   "I'm going to leave California to save 10% of my taxes," when they already have a ton of money,
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.360]   and they're like, "The only bummer is I don't love where I'm going." I'm like, "You have money.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:36.000]   Decide how you want to use it." And someone once told me, "Everywhere you live is the same. You
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.760]   just pay it in different ways. Some places you pay it in taxes. Some places you pay it in weather.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.240]   Some places you pay it in the communities. Some places you pay in healthcare." So I really like
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.600]   living where we're living. I like the neighborhood we live in. I like the schools, the people.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:53.040]   And I'm in a situation financially where I am not hurting to live here. And so until we find
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:58.640]   a better place or want a different experience, this is great. That said, if we were in your
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:05.600]   situation, there's no inertia holding us back. You're not tied down at all. You don't have
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.400]   things to move, a house that you've built. So how do you think about that?
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:16.960]   Yeah. I mean, for me, I value quality of life pretty much above everything else. I am always
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:22.320]   the type of person that would rather pay more taxes to be in a place that has high quality food,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:27.520]   a diverse culture of people, not just a monoculture of strip malls and things like that,
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:36.560]   and interesting people to hang around. I'm obviously in LA, but there for a beat just
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.600]   because we don't obviously know at a school because they've been through a lot right now.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.120]   But come the summer, it's a great question to ask. It's like, "Where is home?"
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:48.080]   LA doesn't feel like home to me. I loved where we lived. I thought it was very neighborhood-y. I
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:55.760]   enjoyed going trick-or-treating with my kids. I grew up doing those old-school "American" things,
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.120]   like the lighting of the Christmas trees in a community area. We used to go to church and do
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.040]   the candlelight church service. Riding your bikes in the neighborhood with your buddies
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.480]   across the street. When the streetlights came on, I'd have to go home. So I loved that part of LA.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:17.600]   For me, LA, I've never been a fan of the crazy high-end wealth neighborhoods where you go and
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:23.040]   it's just sterile and it feels like it's very... I don't want to classify a whole neighborhood,
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.360]   but there's a lot of drugs and cocaine usage and all kinds of horrible things that happen.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:32.240]   But there's also some really nice parts of LA. LA is very much a choose-your-own-adventure
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.640]   depending on what you want to do. You can go have an amazing multi-Michelin-star restaurant,
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.440]   or eat at a crazy dive bar, or a little hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant that's amazing.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.400]   You can go up and down and left and right. That's one of the things that's cool about LA.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:52.320]   But with all the natural disasters and just the infrastructure issues and the homeless problems
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.600]   and the safety around some of that stuff, it makes you really reconsider everything.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.680]   I was just here in the Bay and there's so much excitement around everything that's going on
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   from a technology standpoint that, and me being such a geek, I love interacting with people
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.920]   around here. So it makes a lot of sense. San Diego looks pretty cool too. We've got a couple
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.400]   of friends that live out there. It's a little bit more chill. You get probably a 15% to 20%
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.240]   reduction in terms of cost of living out there. Great weather.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.840]   Great weather. Good food.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:28.080]   Decent food, getting better. And not the crazy fault lines that you get in LA or up here in
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.440]   terms of potential earthquake issues. I mean, still obviously present, but not as bad as LA.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:40.000]   So there's a lot to think through there. But I'm with you in that I'm not going to Puerto Rico.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:48.240]   I'd much rather spend the money on taxes and have less money, but have a life that is a place that
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.760]   you actually want to enjoy your time there. Yeah. I actually have one more. And this is
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.200]   an interesting one. When all these things are happening, you move to a city where everyone's
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:04.080]   left. In the last election, some of our friends went far right. You've gone from no money to
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.360]   having money. How do you stay you? Because some of our friends and some people, maybe less friends,
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.480]   because a lot of the people that we're friends with maybe did that. But some people we know
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.920]   completely changed and then went off in their own world.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.960]   Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess it's kind of-
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.880]   You're really grounded. I feel like you are the same you that I've known for a long time.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.800]   And so I thought about this myself. And I was like, well, things that really helped me just
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:36.400]   stay who I am are having friends and partners that will just call you on anything. When you're not
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:41.200]   being true to who you are, making sure that you have real friendships. I'd rather have a small
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.600]   number of real friends that will call me on my shit than a bunch of friends that I can go out
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:53.200]   to dinner with. But they're not that deep. I think I have a pretty healthy appreciation of not caring
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.920]   what other people think. Mark Manson's subtle art of not giving. I just don't care about if people
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.440]   think some things I do are stupid because I really enjoy going down these rabbit holes.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.080]   I think an awareness of what you care about in the world. So I just did an episode that
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.000]   will probably have come out by the time this comes out or will be with Simon Sinek about
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.120]   part of it was finding your why, finding your purpose. That was super helpful.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.640]   And then I've taken a little bit of time to just write down my core beliefs. I've talked about
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.360]   them. I've thought about them. And I'm like, "These are the things that are really important
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.160]   to me." And just the awareness of what they are makes it easier to hold them through.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.400]   And then the last one I wrote down on this list was,
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.400]   I've gotten really transparent recently, not necessarily publicly, but amongst friends and
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.600]   even acquaintances about things that are usually taboo, like talking about money openly.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.640]   And I first broke the mold with this with one friend who was asking me these questions. And
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.440]   I was like, "God, the answer to these questions would be way easier to help this person if I just
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.000]   could talk about them with real experiences, but it would require me disclosing my net worth and
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.400]   my income." And then I just asked him this question that is probably very strange. I said,
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.640]   "Okay, how much money do you think I have? And how much money do you think I make?"
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.920]   And he was like, "That's a really weird question." And they answered. I was like, "Oh,
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.440]   he was within 15%." So I was like, "Most people probably have the right assumptions."
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.560]   And so it allowed me to break down these barriers of what I wasn't talking about.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.120]   And then I could have real conversations about all these things. And I think it's just forced
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.480]   me to not be a fake version of myself. And I find that you do that. You are that,
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.000]   but I didn't know if you do anything to keep true to who you are.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.160]   Well, I mean, I guess the reason why I went straight politics from the get-go when you first
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:42.400]   asked that question is that we've seen a lot of our friends flip their beliefs largely charged by
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.080]   the political environment that's happened over the last call it 12 months or whatever. And for me,
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.240]   I don't play in that world at all. It probably drives my wife crazy because she's a lot more
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:57.440]   charged by these things. And I find that I don't want to put my head in the sand,
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.000]   but I also don't want to get wrapped up in what I believe is a corrupt system in general.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.280]   And so if I can stay true to myself on that front, then I'm pretty good. And then also,
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:16.800]   I think the key piece is at the end of the day, the most important thing is what you came back to,
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.560]   which is these real friendships and these deep friendships where we say stuff that's slightly
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.560]   offensive to each other all the time, but we don't take ourselves too seriously.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:30.800]   You know what I mean? We can call each other on our bullshit. And if you've run into someone that
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:36.560]   is going to be offended by the fun loving nature of joking and pushing people's buttons and doing
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.120]   the things that you and I typically do with each other, then that's probably just someone I don't
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.800]   need to have as a close friend. And it's not to say I don't want people to challenge me and some
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:52.960]   of my assumptions, but it's just like I try to surround myself with people that can push me in
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:59.040]   new and unique ways, but also accept me for who I am, if that makes sense.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:05.360]   Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how we're both lucky to be that naturally, I think a little bit. It's
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:10.720]   just like we know who we are. I think both of us grew up in that kind of middle high school
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:15.760]   era being kind of nerds. I don't think I've ever had a time in my childhood where I was the popular
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:23.200]   kid. And I think what's hard is when you're young and you're the popular kid, you don't want to lose
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.160]   it. So you want to do the things that make you cool. I just wasn't. I was not that kid. And it's
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:35.120]   not that I was the reject, but I was never the head of the class kind of person. And so it forced
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.720]   me to just be who I was. And this is something I think about for our girls, and you probably do
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:43.360]   for yours. It's like when you're younger, it's so much harder to just be who you are because of all
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.640]   the social pressures. And I think I was a little bit out of the spotlight as a kid. And I think
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:54.480]   that helped. It's actually, it's a great point. One of the things I realized in general is that
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:00.640]   when you grow up in an environment where you're not popular and you don't have a lot of money,
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.960]   you tend to look at the world through the lens of everything is gravy from this point forward.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.600]   When I lost all these belongings at the house, and it was like literally all of my stuff,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.040]   everything, everything. I called you and you were like, I don't have clothes. I don't have a
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:18.320]   computer. I didn't have anything. I had my cell phone and just my clothes, clothes I was wearing.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.960]   That was it. That's all I had because I wasn't at the house at the time. I didn't, I couldn't
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:27.600]   even grab my own stuff because I wasn't there. I was out at a meeting. But when you come from
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.280]   nothing in that, I saw my dad go through bankruptcy when I was a kid. We had dinners
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.080]   that were delivered to us because we couldn't afford Thanksgiving. Like these things happen
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:41.760]   to our family. It's like everything has been just a blessing. And if you can just hold onto that
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   piece, then I don't know, man, it doesn't feel like you just can't lose yourself to the chasing
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.640]   and desires of more is going to make me happier. I think the happiness comes from the internal
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.520]   work that you do. It's the therapy sessions that I go to. It's the meditation practice that I have
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.960]   that is core to what I do. That's the stuff that's making me a more well-rounded individual.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.000]   It's not the acquisition of more and more stuff. Yeah. I think that we finally got to an answer
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.960]   here, which is those things. And we didn't say gratitude, but I feel like that's a little bit
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.880]   what we both talked about. I really appreciate that we have healthy kids, that we live in a
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.880]   great place, that we have all this stuff. Somebody said to me the other day, they're like, "Well,
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:30.560]   you grew up privileged." And I'm like, no doubt in that the fact that I'm male and white,
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.840]   that is... In America.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:39.040]   In America. Those three things alone, huge, massive headstart. I will tell you from the age,
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:46.640]   from fifth grade to all the way through 12th grade, in my era, in the 90s, it was not cool
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.080]   to be in the computers. I got picked on. I had bullies literally push me against lockers, twist
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:57.440]   my arm, do all the horrible shit, because I didn't actually hit my growth spurt until I was in 11th
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.880]   grade. So I was a tiny little dude. And I was into computers. I didn't comb my hair. It was bad.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.320]   And I'm like, "You know what? That kind of worked out. Computers turned out to be a thing." But I
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:15.840]   got made fun of for years for being into computers. I was a nerd. I was a straight up nerd.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:21.360]   I remember my dad had this Toshiba satellite laptop. It was back in the day where the screen
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:26.400]   on a laptop didn't go to the edge. The screen was halfway in from the side.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.360]   That wasn't that long ago.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.960]   Yeah, I know. For some people listening, it was maybe even before they were born.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.320]   And I remember I brought it to school and I would try to get people to play
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.680]   Cannon Fodder, where you were shooting the little cannons and you're like...
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.400]   I still love that game.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.440]   It's a great game. And I just remember that was me at school. Before people brought... I'm sure
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.360]   every kid has a computer at school or an iPhone at school. Someone has a digital device. Back then,
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.080]   it's super nerd.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:48.880]   Yeah, super nerd.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.440]   Super nerd.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:56.640]   Yeah. I was thinking about the first time I kissed a girl. A little peck was like 17 or
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:01.440]   something. It was really embarrassing. A little bit later than most would have done. But I hit
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.400]   my girls for it. And then I was into skateboarding. And I was like, "Oh, the girls were like,
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.960]   'Oh, he's a skateboarder.'" And that worked out.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.360]   Oh, yeah. Skateboarding was never cool in the schools I went to. But...
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.920]   Well, it was cool in a certain subset. I was not a jock guy. I didn't play sports.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.560]   Although I did like to play flag football when I was younger. But yeah,
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.320]   so for me, it was skateboarding.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.760]   Well, I'm glad that you are who you are and that we've been good friends.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   And I love doing this. So thanks for joining me.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.240]   Yeah. It's awesome to be here today. This was a lot of fun questions. We gotta do this again.
