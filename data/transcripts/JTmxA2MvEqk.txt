[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   This video is about optimistic, pessimistic, and my own estimates of how many intelligent alien civilizations might be out there.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.000]   I center this video around the Drake equation that combines a bunch of parameters, multiplies them together,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   and estimates, based on that, the number of alien civilizations in our galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, and the observable universe.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   In general, this video is probably less about the estimates themselves and more about the mysteries behind the very question.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Quick thanks to our two sponsors, Brave Browser, good for your privacy, and Neural Gum, good for your brain.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Check them out in the description to support the podcast I host.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Okay, the Drake equation combines seven parameters, I added an eighth one here.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I'm not using the symbols in the equation because it's too easy for people to forget what each one stands for.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   The variables build on each other, hence the multiplication.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Okay, they are the number of new stars born per year, the percent of those stars that have planets,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   the number of habitable planets per star, the chance of life developing on one of those planets,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   then the chance of intelligent life developing, and finally the chance of that intelligent civilization advancing far enough to develop the technology
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   to be able to communicate, in our case, through electromagnetic signal.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Seventh is the lifetime of that civilization while it's in the communicating stage of its development.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And finally, the eighth parameter that wasn't in the original Drake equation is the average number of times that a civilization is born on a planet.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   That is, one time it's born and it becomes completely extinct and is reborn again.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   This parameter makes sense since the age of a planet can be billions of years.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And then you multiply it all together to get the estimated answer to our question.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I list today's estimates for the optimistic and the pessimistic based on the most recent publications that I'm aware of,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and today's estimates for me based on how I'm actually feeling today.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   This estimate probably drastically changes from day to day or from hour to hour within the day,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   based on my optimism on several of the parameters I'll talk about.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I should say that the optimistic and the pessimistic estimates don't reflect the best case and the worst case.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   They simply reflect a reasonable estimate for a high value for these parameters and a low value for these parameters.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Okay, the number of new stars born per year.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   The pessimistic one is 1.5 and the optimistic is 3. I tend to side with the 3.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   The 1.5 to 3 stars per year is the latest estimate as of about five years ago from NASA.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Most recent relevant paper that I'm aware of is in 2015.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Either way, the variability on this parameter is not very large. Just wait until later.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Okay, the percent of these stars with planets.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   This is a little bit tricky, but it seems to me as of 2012, just looking at some papers,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   almost everyone seems to believe that now pretty much all of these star systems have planets around them.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Somebody's probably going to argue for the pessimistic one being decreased to like 90% or even the previous one of like 30 or even 20%.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I don't think this affects it that much.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   The evidence seems to indicate that pretty much every star has a planet around it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I like big rocks and I like gravity, so I think this is pretty exciting.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   The number of habitable planets per star. This is where we start to get into some fun debate.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Probably mainly centered around the word habitable. Like what does it mean for a planet to be habitable?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   The argument for the optimistic view is it's pretty simple to be in the habitable zone of a star.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   If it's all just about the range of distances from the star.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   The more interesting argument for me that I tend to hold is that in order for a planet to be habitable,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   meaning support life in the broad definition of what life is, the planet doesn't necessarily need to be Earth-like.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   There could be totally different kinds of planets that are able to support life that we're not even aware of.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Those who argue for the low estimate, like the general set of ideas behind the rare Earth hypothesis
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   that you should check out, places a lot more constraints on habitability like suitably low radiation,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   high star metallicity, which by the way, from an astronomer perspective, a metal is anything that's not hydrogen or helium.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   So carbon is a metal. There you go. Fun facts with Lex.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Okay, continuing the list of constraints. Low enough density to avoid excessive asteroid bombardment.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And there's much more. There's a long list. I don't know which one of these is most constraining to be honest,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   but it really centers around the question stated by the rare Earth hypothesis.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Does a habitable planet really have to be Earth-like?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And exactly how close to the precise conditions of Earth does it have to be?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Next parameter is the probability of life developing on a habitable planet.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   This parameter to me is super exciting, especially because it is one of the biggest open questions within the reach of science.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   If we discover hard evidence of life on Mars, for example, even if it's extinct, or in Europa, the icy moon of Jupiter,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and maybe more concrete evidence about life on Venus that was recently discovered in gaseous form of phosphine, I think, in the atmosphere.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So if there's like some good concrete evidence of life on another planet,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   that shows to you that the probability of life developing is quite high.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So the day-to-day variability in my estimate has to do with how optimistic I am about us discovering life on the planets or moons in our solar system.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Going by recent papers, the optimistic is 13%, the pessimistic is 0.1%.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I go somewhere in between those all the time, sometimes much closer to 13%.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Today it's 1%, we're the 1%ers folks.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The argument I think for the high estimate is that life on Earth appears to have started quickly after conditions were right for it.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   So if it started super quick on Earth, maybe it's pretty easy to start when the conditions are right.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And the conditions would be right if we pass the previous parameter of it being a habitable planet.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Again, these parameters stack on top of each other, meaning they're conditioned on whatever the thing that the previous parameter represents being true.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   If we stick just on Earth for our evidence, then the argument for the pessimistic view is that there doesn't seem to be evidence of abiogenesis,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   or the origination of life occurring more than once on Earth.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   As far as I could tell, I did not see any good evidence that life sprung up on Earth more than once.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Meaning evidence of very different kinds of ancestor organisms.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Alright, now we're starting to have some fun.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   The probability of intelligent life developing.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   This is of course probably one I talk a lot about in the context of artificial intelligence.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Optimistic estimate I've seen is 1%, and the pessimistic one is 0.1%.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I tend to actually see this as pretty high probability.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   In fact, I think that once life starts, intelligence is basically 100%.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It's almost inevitable if given enough time.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   The open question to me is how long do there have to be a range of stable conditions that support the evolution of life?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And what precisely that range is once life gets going.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   In general, the argument for the higher value is that complexity of systems seems to increase effortlessly.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And the argument for the lower value is that humans are allegedly the only intelligent species on Earth
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   among a lot of the species that have lived here.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   So it may be quite difficult even for the evolutionary process to create something like the human brain.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Which I do think is quite a special creation, despite its, in my case, occasional manifestation as dad jokes on Twitter.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Okay. Oh, and I don't understand the optimistic estimate 1% that I saw in a few places, so I doubled it to 2%.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   That's where I stand on the probability of intelligent life developing.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   There you go. Double it.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Okay. Ability to communicate.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   I kind of think of this as the percent of civilizations that become technologically advanced
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   in the more general context of building advanced technologies.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And I tend to see communication as bigger here than maybe the original Drake estimate did
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   in that it's likely to go beyond electromagnetic communication,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   something that we're not even aware of currently.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So the argument for the high value here is that, again, systems seem to increase in complexity effortlessly.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So it seems to me that tech advancement is inevitable once you have a sufficiently intelligent civilization.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   The arguments that I find somewhat interesting for the more pessimistic estimate is that civilizations,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   perhaps in time, tend to isolate themselves.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   They perhaps lose interest in colonization or just broadly in the whole task of exploration and communication.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Another idea is that possibly there is a divergent methodology to the ways that intelligent civilizations might communicate.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And so there might not be intersection about them being able to communicate with each other,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   like totally new ways of information transfer that we're just not even aware of currently,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   which does not involve any kind of leakage of signal that would nevertheless still be detectable.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So I tend to be on the optimistic side of communication ability developing with the 20% estimate.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Next is the lifetime of the civilization once it's already in that communicating advanced technology stage.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I think this is one of the more interesting, one of the more open parameters that basically changes the game in the final estimate.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   This is where the most variability comes from.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   The previous parameters I find inspiring as a scientist and engineer.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   This parameter I find inspiring as a human, because the higher we can get it up as a human civilization,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   the more likely it is that we make extensive, deep, meaningful contact with other intelligent alien civilizations.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   So the optimistic values here are very high and they range all over the place.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   But it centers around the idea that there's one or multiple great filters,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and once we get past them as a technological civilization,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   then we're basically immortal from a civilization perspective,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   that we will increasingly colonize space, I guess diversifying our use of resources,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   such that it becomes increasingly more difficult to destroy ourselves through the various existential threats that we face.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   The pessimistic estimate, if we look at human civilization as an average case,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   and assume we destroy ourselves within a couple of years,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   then for humans the stage of advanced technology is only going to last about 100 years.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   When we were able to send out explicit electromagnetic signal,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   of course I don't think we chose to do so explicitly until maybe a few decades ago,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I don't remember, I think it was the 70s, stairway to heaven Led Zeppelin era, there you go.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   My estimate, to be honest, in terms of the survival of human civilization is almost always pretty optimistic.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   The actual estimate of the lifetime ranges all over the place.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I think my current estimate, I just put it 10,000 years, I think even that's really far away.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   That's a hundred centuries from now.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   We're just in the first 100, 150 years of our advanced technological development,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and what's going to happen in the next 100 of those,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   especially given that the rate of innovation seems to be accelerating,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   the essentials of my optimism is grounded in the fact that the forces of good
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   will be able to out-innovate the forces of evil.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Now what that looks like 10,000 years from now,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   it's like impossible for me to even imagine,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   so I'm uncomfortable with an estimate of one billion years from now.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   So that's why I put my optimistic, but not too optimistic,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   estimate of a lifetime of advanced technological civilization at 10,000 years.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   We're 100 years in, 9,900 years to go to prove me wrong.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And finally this extra parameter of the number of times a civilization is born on a planet,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   given the age of a planet, and if it is habitable,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   then I think, and some optimistic estimates think,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   that it's possible for intelligent civilizations to be reborn on a planet,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   and put that value at three.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   The original estimate, of course, it wasn't part of the Drake equation,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   so it was at one, and so that's the pessimistic estimate.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Okay, so we multiply all these together,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   of course the percentages are treated as fractions,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   so 13% is .13, for example,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   and the result of that multiplication is the estimate of intelligent alien civilizations
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   that are capable of communicating in our galaxy.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And so for these three estimates, the result is 468,000 for the optimistic estimate,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   very, very close to zero for the pessimistic estimate,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   and 0.7 for my estimate.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Now that's for our Milky Way galaxy.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Interestingly enough, the estimates for the number of galaxies
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   in the observable universe seems to be changing, and growing actually,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   and the current estimate that I'm aware of is actually 2 trillion galaxies,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   which is a very high number.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   So if we look at the number of alien communicating civilizations in the universe,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   it's 940 quadrillion, which is 1,000 trillion, for the optimistic estimate.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It's 300,000 for the pessimistic estimate,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   and 1.4 trillion for my estimate as of this hour today.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Obviously there's quite a bit of variability,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   and I find it quite entertaining that my estimate landed on very close to one,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   which aligns well with the idea that if we're pretty average in the Milky Way,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   we're pretty average, that we just may be the only ones in the Milky Way galaxy.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   But every galaxy's got one.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   There's a bunch of takeaways I have from this quick thought experiment,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and the reason I made the video is I wanted to go through the thought experiment,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   provide my estimates, and also reason through the very question itself,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   and some of the open questions around the estimate.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   So my current view is that we're not alone in terms of communicating
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   alien intelligent civilizations in the universe.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   But the sense I have in terms of the very concept of communication
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   is that we don't yet have the tools of science to understand what it means
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   to communicate with alien intelligence.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I tend to believe that aliens are very unlikely to have the humanoid form,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   that much more likely the variety of life is greater than we imagine
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and greater than we can imagine.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Some of the variability would perhaps invalidate entirely the very structure
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   of the Drake equation itself, which makes a lot of cosmological assumptions.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Life could exist in different dimensions,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   whatever the heck that would even mean for a physics perspective.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   As Carl Sagan talked about, it could exist on very different time scales
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   and very different spatial scales, which would make communication to us appear,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   like I think Sagan said, like noise.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Because of our tools, but also because of the human-centric perspective
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   we have on intelligence, that we're just not accustomed to trying to detect
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   signal that operates in a different time scale
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   and even on a different spatial scale.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And not just life itself, I think the variety and extent of intelligence
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and communication methodology is greater than we can imagine
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   and greater than we can imagine.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Intelligent beings could operate at different conceptual spaces
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   or layers of abstraction.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   The nature of communication, I think for humans it's in the space of ideas.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It could be in the space of experiences,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   or it could be in the space of whatever lays behind consciousness, for example.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Consciousness itself may be aliens communicating with us.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I mean, from the current scientific perspective, all of this sounds pretty crazy,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   but if you step away and just think from first principles
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   of how little we actually understand about the basic nature of the human mind,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   then you have to think that understanding our mind
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   may unlock some totally new ways of communication
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   and unlock our understanding of what it means
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   to be an intelligent civilization
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   that will totally transform the estimates provided by the Drake equation.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And that's why I think it's really inspiring to scientists, engineers,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   just curious minds that the pursuits maybe in my field of AI
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and perhaps eventually the field of AI starts to encompassing
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   the concepts of artificial consciousness.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I think that provides the opportunity for both the scientists
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   and the engineers to understand the human mind
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   and to build artificial versions of it, you know,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   artificial general intelligence.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   And that seems to hold the key.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And that is an engineering problem, is a scientific problem,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   but it seems to hold the key for us to be able to better understand
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   what kind of other intelligent civilizations might be out there.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Again, that's super exciting because in a sense,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   understanding ourselves is one way to search
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   for intelligent civilizations out there.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And in general, as I mentioned, I think all,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   or at least most of the parameters in the Drake equation
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   can be illuminated through science and through our engineering pursuit.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   So if we discover life on Mars, for example,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   that shows that life is doable elsewhere.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   If we are able to build artificial general intelligence systems,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   at least to me, that shows that intelligence is doable elsewhere
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   other than the human brain.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And, you know, as a society,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   if we're able to avoid existential risks that are before us today,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I think that shows that survival is doable elsewhere.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Okay, looking at point three, four, and five quickly,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   let me say that this whole idea of other intelligent alien civilizations
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   out there is really exciting and inspiring to me.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   So I hope that governments, nation states,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   will be able to look at the search for intelligent life,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   not as a threat, not as something that you keep as a secret,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   but as something that can inspire us.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I think we're humans first and Americans second.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   We're curious descendants of apes.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And I think the idea of threats and secrecy,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I hope will become an outdated concept.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   But of course, it's not just about hope.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   You have to work hard to make it happen.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You have to have actual practical ideas how we get there.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Because right now, the old systems are stuck in this place
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   where it's nice to have two superpowers fighting against each other.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   There's the Soviet Union and the United States.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Maybe the 21st century will be defined by China
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   versus the United States and so on.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I think it's possible, and I think we have to build systems
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   that move us beyond that.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   I think for point number four, I think doing so is essential
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   for the survival of the human species.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Again, that's my current view, but I think about this a lot,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   and I go back and forth.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   It mostly has to do about, at least my thinking,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   on how much evil there is in the world.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And right now, for a time at least, I'm quite optimistic
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   about the fundamental good in human nature.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And finally, of course, in terms of increasing the lifetime
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   of human civilization, but in general,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   finding intelligent life out there,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I think space exploration is really exciting.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   In general, this whole topic, the reason I made this video,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   the reason I have sometimes these conversations about aliens
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   is I do believe that science is the best tool we have,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   but we can still have an open mind
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   to the mystery of the universe around us.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And of course, to me, the most fascinating,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   the mystery of the human mind itself.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   So clearly, this particular human mind has to apologize
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   for the probably too long, boring rambling about aliens,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   but I hope for the few of you still listening
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   that it was at least somewhat interesting.
