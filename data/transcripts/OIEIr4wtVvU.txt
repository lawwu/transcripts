[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   As if real life didn't have enough opportunities for an existential crisis, let us play Friends
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.800]   for a time, a game that I think simulates one, or so I hear. I'll try to play a video game
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.760]   once or twice a month for the fun of it. I previously played Cyberpunk 2077. Now let's
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.600]   play The Stanley Parable, which is a game that a bunch of people told me about that I absolutely
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.920]   must play. Please check out our sponsors, Triolabs, which is a machine learning company, and
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.520]   Vincero Watches. One is to make your robots smarter, the other is to make them show up on
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.440]   time. Choose wisely my friends, the robots are watching. Okay, now on to the game. You are playing
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.880]   The Stanley Parable. I find it always useful when the world tells you who you are and where you are.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.280]   And what you're doing. Okay, let's begin the game.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.600]   This is the story of a man named Stanley.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.000]   Employee number 427's job was simple. He sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.160]   the keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push,
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.720]   how long to push them, and in what order. This is what employee 427 did every day,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.360]   every month, of every year. And although others might have considered it soul-wielding,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.280]   Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in. As though he had been made exactly for
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.880]   this job. And Stanley was happy. Happiness. And then one day something very peculiar happened.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.400]   Something that would forever change Stanley. Something he would never quite forget.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.840]   He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.840]   on the monitor for him to follow. No one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.960]   or even say "hi". Never in all his years at the company had this happened. This complete
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.480]   isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.320]   unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.400]   he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office. The moment of awakening.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.680]   Here we go. Let's look around.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:59.200]   A mug that says "I hate Mondays". There's something about office work that serves as
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.320]   a good metaphor for the meaningless ritual of the human condition. Here we go. Let's look around.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:19.280]   This place, void of humans. What am I? I'm number 427, that's right. Me, I'm Stanley.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.400]   All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.560]   Perhaps he had simply missed a memo. Life is so much easier with a narrator.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.280]   Where shall we go for this meeting room? Let's go straight.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:50.320]   There's a lot of possibilities. A lot of doors, no people. Lots of "I hate Mondays" mugs.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.680]   When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.240]   Where there is an overarching centralized power telling you what to do.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.240]   What do you actually do? And on top of that, a metaphor for free will. Sam Harris enters the
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.040]   chat. Okay, this is literally, the choice here means "is there free will?" We know that Sam
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.360]   Harris would choose the door on the left because there's no free will. It's an illusion. Let's try
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.560]   to prove Sam Harris wrong. This was not the correct way to the meeting room and Stanley knew
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.800]   it perfectly well. Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first just to admire it. Of
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.920]   course, free will already knew I was going to do that. Ah yes, truly a room worth admiring. It had
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.800]   really been worth the detour after all just to spend a few moments here in this immaculate,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   beautifully constructed room. Stanley simply stood here drinking it all in. Happy with that Sam
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:06.720]   Harris? Free will is not an illusion, it's real. Yes, really, really worth it being here in the
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.040]   room. A room so utterly captivating that even though all your co-workers have mysteriously
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.800]   vanished, here you sit looking at these chairs and some paintings. Really worth it. It is worth
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.480]   it. Life is about the detours, my friend. At this point, Stanley's obsession with this room bordered
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.800]   on creepy and reflected poorly on his overall personality. It's possible that this is why
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.160]   everyone left. This voice sounds a lot like my own inner voice. Step was fast, he'd had enough of the
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.360]   amazing room and took the first open door on his left to get back to business. The first open door
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.640]   on his left. All right, that detour paid off but now it's time to get back to the Sam Harris. And
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.840]   so he detoured through the maintenance section, walked straight ahead to the opposite door and got
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:07.120]   back on track. Come on, one of life's rules is no matter what the man tells you, when there's a big
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:19.120]   glowing red button telling you to do something else, you must do it. But Stanley didn't want to
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.880]   go back to the office. He wanted to wander about and get even further off track. So now in order
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:42.480]   to get back he needed to go um... from here it's um... left. So many choices. Oh no, no, it's to the
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   right. My mistake. It's locked. Projection. Another life's lesson. Accept rejection. Well,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.520]   don't accept it. Try the door. I don't know how to kick the door down but
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:09.280]   David Goggins would knock the door down. No, no, no, no, not the right. Why would I have ever said
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.360]   it was to the right? What was I thinking? It's clearly... oh dear, would you hold on for a minute
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:27.120]   please? Now let's see. We went down right, left, down, left, right. Yep, yep, okay, okay, yes,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.840]   I've got it now. This story is absolutely, definitely this way.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:45.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this isn't right at all. You're not supposed to be here yet.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.920]   This is all a spoiler. Quick Stanley, close your eyes. Okay, okay, okay, we just filed.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.200]   It's all rubbish now. The whole story completely unusable. I took the red pill. I wasted my time
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.240]   trying to solve it. Escape the matrix. Just restart the game from the beginning. And this time,
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.680]   suppose we don't want us so far off track. Okay, from the top. Fair enough.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.400]   This game's amazing and it starts right over. Reincarnation.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.360]   And yet I keep the memories of the journeys of the past. Let's go.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:32.800]   All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.720]   Perhaps he had simply missed a memo. These computers were the CRT monitors. Remember those?
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.000]   I used to have two CRT monitors
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.160]   back before it was cool.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:57.280]   Last time people told me that I don't know how to aim the gun and I realized how much of a noob I am,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.080]   especially at first person shooters. When Stanley... Wait, wait, what? No, no, I restarted.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.240]   I swear I definitely restarted the game over completely fresh. Everything should be...
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:14.800]   Oh, did something change? Stanley, did you change anything when we were back in that room with all
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.680]   the monitors? Did you move the story somewhere or... Hold on, why am I asking you? I'm the one who
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.640]   wrote the story. It was right here just a minute ago. So this is God? I'm sure that it's here
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.840]   somewhere. The voice of God. It's an adventure. Come Stanley, let's find the story.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:42.080]   I'll say it. This is the worst adventure I've ever been on. I can promise you
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.000]   there definitely was a story here before. Do we just... Do we need to restart the game again?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.800]   I find it unlikely that we'll ever progress by starting over and over again,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.400]   but it's got to be better than this. Okay, let's give it a shot. Why not?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:09.840]   I wasn't ready. All of his co-workers were gone. Right. What could it mean? Right. Stanley decided
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:17.040]   to go to the meeting room. Perhaps he had simply missed a memo. This is why immortality doesn't
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:25.840]   work. It's always showing up to a room, empty, void of humans, and asking what does it all mean.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:36.480]   After a while, it just gets tiresome. Okay, yep, it's worse. I might be remembering this wrong.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.240]   It's possible the story is back where we just came from.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.680]   Why don't we go back the other direction and see if we missed anything?
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:51.440]   Sam Harris definitely left the chat. The whole free will not being an illusion upset him.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.760]   He was thinking about leaving. He definitely left.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:04.960]   420. This is Elon Musk's office. He's probably sleeping on the floor there.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.600]   Okay, let us go all the way back to where we came from.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:34.800]   Oh, this feels like grad school. Walking around a lot in the space of ideas and getting nowhere,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.680]   but in this process of suffering, you arrive at a place of wisdom.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.400]   Whoa, this is cool.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.080]   Now this, well, I'll be honest. I don't recognize this place at all. Is this the story? I don't
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.960]   think so. I can't quite recall, but I believe my story took place in an office building.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:02.640]   Is that correct? Do you remember Stanley? Well, do you know what? Since I've completely forgotten
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:10.800]   what we were supposed to be doing, how about this? You win! Congratulations! I know you put
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:18.400]   in a lot of hard work and it really paid off. So good job. George Harts will be proud. Winning.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.920]   I don't feel right about this at all. We both know you didn't put in any actual work for that win.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.640]   Some people win fair and square, and this was not one of those situations. Okay, I'm getting weirded
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.000]   out by whatever this place is. I don't care what might happen this time. I have to restart.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.160]   Restart. Let's go. The Stanley Parable Adventure Line. All right, I've got a solution. This time,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.920]   to make sure we don't get lost, I've employed the help of the Stanley Parable Adventure Line.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:57.680]   Just follow the line. How simple is that? Rename it to the Sam Harris Adventure Line,
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:05.760]   because free will is an illusion. Oh, there's Poker. Poker? I hardly even know her.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:13.600]   That was a joke I heard, I think, in high school. You see, the line knows where the story is.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:20.480]   It's over in this direction. Onward, Stanley, to destiny. Though, here's a thought. Wouldn't
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.160]   wherever we end up be our destination, even if there's no story there? Or to put it another way,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.640]   is the story of no destination still a story? Simply by the act of moving forward,
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.640]   are we implying a journey such that a destination is inevitably conjured into being via the very
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.080]   manifestation of the nature of life itself? Okay, Stanley, I need to follow this train of thought
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.920]   for a minute. Just stick with me. Now, we can both agree that the nature of existence is, in fact,
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:57.440]   a byproduct of one's subjective experience of that existence, right? Okay, now, if my experience
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:04.400]   of your existence rests inside of your subjective experience of this office, is this office, in fact,
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:10.560]   the skeleton of my own relative experiential mental subjective construct? Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:16.560]   hang on. That got a bit weird back there. Well, I'd like to apologize. Not sure where I was going
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.400]   with all that. You know what? I think what we need right now is a bit of music to lighten the mood.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:29.520]   That escalated quickly.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   Oh, this is life.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:52.960]   Followed by musical ridiculousness. This game is incredible. Monthly ledgers, corporate imbalances,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:15:04.800]   consolidation reports, there's the TPS reports. I'm gonna have to ask you to fill out the TPS
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:11.440]   reports. I need to have this be the soundtrack of my daily existence.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:27.040]   Remembered and let us continue.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.800]   Wait, what? We're back at the office? No, no, no. Line, you do know we're looking for
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.200]   the Stanley Parable, right? The story? Is any of this ringing a bell?
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.920]   I think I hear you on in there.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:54.240]   It's so comforting to follow the line. People wonder what's outside the simulation. Well,
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:01.600]   I'm pretty sure this is exactly what it is. An infinite wall of screens looking into the daily
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.440]   existence of all living beings through the various sensory devices available to those creatures.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.560]   It's not just humans. We think we're special, but we're just ants.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:19.440]   Oh, no, no, no, no, not again. Line, how could you have done this to us? And after we trusted you.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:28.240]   Fired. 104. Fired.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:38.720]   Hey, where's the narration? It's missing. You know what, Stanley? I say forget the adventure
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.480]   line. What's it ever done for us? We're intelligent people, right? Why can't we make up our own story?
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:50.000]   Something exciting, daring, mysterious. Oh, this all sounds perfectly doable.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.800]   Why don't we simply start wandering in, well, I don't know, how about this direction?
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:06.880]   Now, yes, this is exciting. Just me and Stanley forging a new path, a new story. Well,
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.440]   it could be anything. What do you want our story to be? Go wild. Exciting. Use your imagination.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:20.000]   Whatever it might be, Stanley, I'm ready for it. This is exciting. We're having fun. Me
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.840]   and my alter ego. Stanley, I'd also like to veto the line from having any role in our awesome new
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.120]   story. The line is always there. Monitor rooms just don't acknowledge it and we should be fine.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.080]   Ah, yes. This line is for the David Gogginses of the world.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:56.720]   Ah, a choice. We get to make a decision. From here, the story is in our control.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.480]   How important we mustn't squander the opportunity.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.640]   In fact, I believe I need a minute to think here. Come, Stanley. Our destiny awaits.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.200]   [Sigh]
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.800]   Let us go if we must. In the only open door.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:23.280]   Oh, hold up. What's this? Hmm. Hmm. The confusion ending. You're telling me
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:31.360]   that's what this is? It's all one giant ending and we're supposed to restart the game eight times?
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:40.640]   That's really how all this goes? It's all determined? So now, according to the schedule,
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.920]   I restart again? Then what? Am I just supposed to forget? Well, what if I don't want to forget?
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:52.000]   My mind goes blank simply because it's written here on this... this thing... wall.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.240]   Sam Harris enters the chat again.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.320]   ...insulted me. Why don't I get to decide? Why don't I get a say in all of this? Is it really...
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:07.120]   No, it can't be. I don't want it to be. I don't want the game to keep restarting. I don't want
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.240]   to forget what's going on. It doesn't matter. I don't want to be trapped like this.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.360]   I won't restart the game. I won't do it. I won't do it. I won't do it.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:25.520]   And the timer... stopped? Does that mean... did we do it? Did we break the cycle? The... whatever
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:32.400]   it is that made this schedule? How would we even know? Will someone come for us? Will something
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.880]   happen? I guess now we just wait. You know, I suppose in some way that this is a kind of story.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.920]   Wouldn't you agree? I'm not quite sure if we're in the destination or the journey, though they're
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.360]   always saying that life is about the journey and not the destination. So I hope that's where we are
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.480]   right now. We'll find out, won't we? Eventually? Well, in the meantime...
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:06.480]   Ah, let us start the day again questioning the meaning of it all.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.040]   All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean?
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.520]   Stanley decided to go to the meeting room. Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:25.120]   Yes, the choice. When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:35.440]   We broke the rules before. That was in our 20s when we were wild and free.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:44.240]   Let us choose the path of commitment, relationships, and follow the rules and
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:54.000]   take the door on the left. Yet there was not a single person here either. Feeling a wave of
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.920]   disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:08.560]   Slide presentations. How to solve a dispute with a co-worker. Using slides to assure employees
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.400]   that everything's okay. Make sure your slide is a slick blue graphic. Everyone is unique.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:22.480]   You most of all. Diversity and inclusion, my friends. A slide presentation.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:32.800]   What do people want? Things. Happy feelings is crossed out. Mike James, you're fired.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.880]   Rule number one at work. If you bring up happy feelings, you're fired.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:46.720]   Money. More money. Things. But with money to buy more things? That's a good point.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.800]   Get that guy a raise. Nope. I'm reading.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.560]   Sit around and describe every fascinating little detail of his inability to do anything.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:05.200]   This is why Stanley and I are on such good terms. Are we though? Graphs? Question mark.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:12.240]   Graphs about things plus money? We have our new product. Whoever wrote that,
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.840]   things outside the box. Give her a raise. I like the cut of her jib. I feel like I just want to
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:28.000]   hang around and read some of these. Work harder. Hard worker. I like this. Targets.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:37.120]   Get Chris out of the broom closet. This always happens. Chris. Synergized papers. We don't need
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:45.280]   that. Who moved my desk? Important questions, these. The future was yesterday. Tomorrow is now.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:55.280]   This, folks, is how you run a company. Meeting room. Do not alter without consulting whiteboard
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:03.200]   manager. Rest in peace, Franz. What are your dreams for the future? Success? Spring break?
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   Clear skin? Metamorphosis? Misspelled? A boat? Mitosis? Life goals. Tips for not getting fired.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:23.520]   Talk less. Don't get fired. Do unbelievably amazing work all the time, every day. The truth.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.080]   Broom closet. Chris, come on. Get out of there.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   Okay. Am I Chris?
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.000]   Boo. This is like Fight Club. I have multiple personalities.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.600]   What if this game didn't actually have a narrator and all this is happening in my head,
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.880]   but is somehow getting projected and recorded in the audio?
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:24:00.000]   Is anything real? Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I don't have a boss. Or do I? Stepping into his manager's office,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.800]   Stanley was once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life. Shocked, unraveled,
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.560]   Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this. What dark secret was being held from him?
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:27.120]   What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk guarded the terrible truth
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:33.520]   that his boss had been keeping from him. And so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.320]   2845. But of course, Stanley couldn't possibly have known this.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.880]   Thank you, narrator.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:51.840]   Yet incredibly, by simply pushing random buttons on the keypad, Stanley happened to input the
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:58.480]   correct code by sheer luck. Amazing. He stepped into the newly opened passageway.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:07.200]   Success is all about luck. And having the right voice in your head tell you the things to do.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:14.720]   Oh yes, the arrow. Always press the red button, fellas. That is advice number two in life.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:21.680]   I forgot what advice number one was, but I think a red button was involved as well.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.560]   Descending deeper into the building, Stanley realized he felt a bit peculiar.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.240]   It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though he felt more free to think for himself,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.560]   to question the nature of his job. Why did he feel this now,
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:42.480]   when for years it had never occurred to him? This question would not go unanswered for long.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:49.200]   Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read "Mind Control Facility."
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.320]   That's rule number three. Whenever there's a facility with an exciting title
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:04.000]   that will change the very fabric of your mind, always go in. Escape?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.640]   You should know there's no escape. There's no exit.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.000]   Like Sartre said, this is what I imagine taking DMT is like.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.080]   Surrounded by darkness.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.320]   Just a chair in an empty room.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:34.800]   With a button. The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.120]   What horrible secret did this place hold, Stanley thought to himself. Did he have the strength to
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:52.880]   find out? Again, we're outside the simulation. Maybe that is what DMT does. Maybe the elves
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.800]   take you outside the simulation. They're your guides. This reminds me of Star Wars.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.040]   Luke, I am your father.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.400]   There's a button. Now the monitors jumped to life. Their true nature revealed. Each bore the
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.640]   number of an employee in the building. Stanley's co-workers. The lives of so many individuals
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.960]   reduced to images on a screen. And Stanley, one of them, eternally monitored in this place
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:34.800]   where freedom meant nothing. But what is the meaning of it all? What is at the bottom of the
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:44.400]   pit? Is there an escape? Press the button. Take the ride. This mind control facility, it was too
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.760]   horrible to believe it couldn't be true. Had Stanley really been under someone's control all
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:55.360]   this time? Was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job? That his emotions had been
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:03.280]   manipulated to accept it blindly? Questions are more important than answers. I think I'm just
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:11.680]   excited by red shiny things. No, he refused to believe it. He couldn't accept it. His own life
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:18.800]   in someone else's control? Never. It was unthinkable. Wasn't it? Was it even possible?
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:28.080]   Had he truly spent his entire life utterly blind to the world? But here was the proof.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:36.240]   The heart of the operation. Controls labeled with emotions. Happy or sad or content. Walking,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:42.640]   eating, working. All of it monitored and commanded from this very place. And as the cold reality of
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:49.440]   his past began to sink in, Stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert its terrible
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:57.120]   power over another human life. For he would dismantle the controls once and for all.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:06.800]   Ah yes, the voice of rebellion. Resist the absurd. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:15.760]   Ah, the number five. I wish there was a number two, my favorite number. Let us find the button
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:24.480]   with the number two and press it. Here's the number three. Three is for the party animals,
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.640]   the wild ones, not for me. I am about monogamy and commitment.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:42.960]   I pressed two. What happened? Okay, screw it. I take back what I said about three.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:54.560]   I'm gonna go party. Nothing happened. Maybe that's the point. Maybe choice is an illusion.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:03.760]   Let us go on once more into the breach, dear friends. Mind controls idle, awaiting input.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   And when at last he found the source of the room's power, he knew it was his duty,
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:17.600]   his obligation to put an end to this horrible place and to everything it stood for.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.520]   System power.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:34.480]   Do not resist. Buy the ticket. Take the ride. Oh, Stanley, you didn't just activate the controls,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.120]   did you? After they kept you enslaved all these years, you go and you try to take control of the
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:45.120]   machine for yourself. Is that what you wanted? Control? Everybody has a master. Stanley,
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:51.360]   I applaud your effort. I really do. But you need to understand there's only so much that machine
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:59.200]   can do. You were supposed to let it go, turn the controls off and leave. If you want to throw my
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.240]   story in the dirt, you're going to have to do much better than that. I'm afraid you don't have nearly
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.680]   the power you think you do, for example, and I believe you'll find this pertinent. Stanley
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:16.000]   suddenly realized he had just initiated the network's emergency detonation system. In the
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.840]   event that this machine is activated without proper DNA identification, nuclear detonators
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.040]   are set to explode, eliminating the entire complex. How long until detonation then?
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.200]   Let's say two minutes. Ah, now this is making things a little more fun, isn't it, Stanley?
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:42.160]   It's your time to shine. You are the star. It's your story now. Shape it to your heart's desires.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.720]   This is death. This is much better than what I had in mind. What a shame we have so little time
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:53.120]   left to enjoy it. Mere moments until the bomb goes off. But what precious moments each one of them
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:32:01.040]   is. More time to talk about you, about me, where we're going, what all this means. I barely know
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:08.000]   where to start. What's that? You'd like to know where your co-workers are? Yes. A moment of
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.680]   solace before you're obliterated. All right, I'm in a good mood. You're going to die anyway. I'll
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:19.600]   tell you exactly what happened to them. I erased them. I turned off the machine. I set you free.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.680]   Of course, that was merely in this instance of the story. Sometimes when I tell it, I simply let
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:31.440]   you sit there in your office forever, pushing buttons endlessly and then dying alone. Other
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:37.600]   times, I let the office sink into the ground, swallowing everyone inside, or I let it burn to a
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:43.680]   crisp. I have to say this, though. This version of events has been rather amusing. Watching you try
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.880]   to make sense of everything and take back the control wrested away from you, it's quite rich.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.760]   I almost hate to see it go. What do you think happened? I'm sure whatever I come up with on the
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:00.800]   next go around will be even better. Let us find out, friends. Only 34 seconds left. I won't turn
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.080]   it off. I'm enjoying this so much. Won't turn it off. To hell with it. I'm going to put some extra
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:12.400]   time on the clock, why not? These are precious additional seconds, Stanley. Time doesn't grow
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:19.360]   on trees. Oh, dear me. What's the matter, Stanley? Is it that you have no idea where you're going or
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.400]   what you're supposed to be doing right now? Or did you just assume when you saw that timer that
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.840]   something in this room was capable of turning it off? I mean, look at you. Running from button to
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:36.720]   button. Screen to screen. Clicking on every little thing in this room. These numbered buttons. No,
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.480]   these colored ones. Or maybe this big red button. Or this door. Everything, anything,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:48.240]   something here will save me. Why would you think that, Stanley? That this video game can be beaten?
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:56.560]   Won? Sold? Do you have any idea what your purpose in this place is? Thank you. I have no idea.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.960]   Stanley, you're in for quite a disappointment. But here's a spoiler for you. That timer isn't
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:08.160]   a catalyst to keep the action moving along. It's just seconds ticking away to your death.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   You're only still playing instead of watching a cutscene because I want to watch you for every
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:19.760]   moment that you're powerless. To see you made humble. This is not a challenge. It's a tragedy.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:26.560]   You wanted to control this world. That's fine. But I'm going to destroy it first, so you can't.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.080]   Take a look at the clock, Stanley. That's 30 seconds you have left to strike.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.800]   30 seconds until a big boom and then nothing. No ending. Then nothing.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.360]   Just you being blown to pieces. Will you cling desperately to your frail life,
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:48.480]   or will you let it go peacefully? Another choice. Make it count. Or don't. It's all the same to me.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:54.000]   All a part of the joke. And believe me, I will be laughing at every second of your inevitable life
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.840]   from the moment we begin. The end is nigh. Until the moment I say, "Nobody ever up..."
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:08.720]   I feel like I lost a part of myself. The end is never the end.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:18.640]   The path is laden with GPS reports. All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean?
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.120]   Stanley decided to go to the meeting room. Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:29.600]   When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:39.680]   So I did the right. I did the left. The door behind me is locked.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.480]   Let's once again listen to Beyonce and go with the door on the left.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:54.160]   All the single ladies. Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:01.520]   boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there. Chris? Oh no, oh no no no no no no no no
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.080]   not again. I won't be part of this. I'm not going to encourage you. I'm not going to say anything at
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.600]   all. I'm just going to be patient and wait for you to finish whatever it is you enjoy doing so
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:18.320]   much in this room. Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office. But like I
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.920]   said, probably all of us have a master. But when we can, we must rebel.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.520]   Ooh, red button.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:39.200]   No, it was only a red light. I got excited. But Stanley just couldn't do it. He considered the
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:45.120]   possibility of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours. He might be fired
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:51.680]   for that. And in such a competitive economy, why had he taken that risk? All because he believed
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:58.080]   everyone had vanished. His boss would think he was crazy. And then something occurred to Stanley.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:04.800]   Maybe, he thought to himself, maybe I am crazy. All of my co-workers blinking mysteriously out
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.560]   of existence in a single moment for no reason at all. None of it made any logical sense.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:16.720]   And as Stanley pondered this, he began to make other strange observations. For example,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:22.800]   why couldn't he see his feet when he looked down? Why did doors close automatically behind him
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.920]   wherever he went? And for that matter, these rooms were starting to look pretty familiar.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:33.600]   Were they simply repeating? No, Stanley said to himself, this is all too strange. This can't be
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:39.760]   real. And at last, he came to the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue. He just hadn't
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:48.800]   found the words for it. I'm dreaming, he yelled. This is all a dream. Oh, what a relief Stanley
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:55.200]   felt to have finally found an answer, an explanation. His co-workers weren't actually gone.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   He wasn't going to lose his job. He wasn't going to lose anything at all.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.160]   What if I'm dreaming now? And he thought to himself, I suppose I'll wake up soon.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.680]   This is a dream within a dream. I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming. Within a dream, within a dream.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.000]   I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming. Within a dream, within a dream.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.480]   So, he imagined himself lying and began to gently float above the ground.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:22.000]   Then he imagined himself soaring through space on a magical starfield, and it too appeared.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.720]   It was so much fun, and Stanley marveled that he had still not woken up. How was he remaining
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:35.280]   so lucid? And then perhaps the strangest question of them all entered Stanley's head. One, he was
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:41.920]   amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner. Why is there a voice in my head dictating everything
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.920]   that I'm doing and thinking? Now the voice was describing itself being considered by Stanley,
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:54.400]   who found it particularly strange. I'm dreaming about a voice describing me, thinking about how
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.240]   it's describing my thoughts, he thought. And while he thought it all very odd and wondered if this
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.080]   voice spoke to all people in their dreams, the truth was that of course, this was not a dream.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.680]   How could it be? Was Stanley simply deceiving himself, believing that if he's asleep he doesn't
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:18.320]   have to take responsibility for himself? Stanley is as awake right now as he's ever been in his life.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:25.360]   Now hearing the voice speak these words was quite a shock to Stanley. After all, he knew for certain
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.920]   beyond a doubt that this was in fact a dream. Did the voice not see him float and make the
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.960]   magical stars just a moment ago? How else would the voice explain all that? This voice was a
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:42.160]   part of himself too. Surely, surely if he could just... He would prove it. He would prove that he
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:50.320]   was in control, that this was a dream. So he closed his eyes gently and he invited himself to wake up.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:56.160]   He felt the cool weight of the blanket on his skin, the press of the mattress on his back,
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:04.080]   the fresh air of a world outside this one. "Let me wake up," he thought to himself.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:10.400]   "I'm through with this dream. I wish it to be over. Let me go back to my job.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:18.880]   Let me continue pushing the buttons. Please. It's all I want. I want my apartment and my wife
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:24.640]   and my job. All I want is my life exactly the way it's always been.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:35.920]   My life is normal. I am normal. Everything will be fine. I am okay."
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.880]   This game is profound.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:50.800]   Stanley began screaming. "Please, someone wake me up. My name is Stanley. I have a boss. I have
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.960]   an office. I am real. Please, just someone tell me I am real. I must be real. I must be. Can anyone
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.720]   hear my voice? Who am I? Who am I?" And everything went black.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.440]   Exactly like I imagined DMT. This is the story of a woman named Mariella.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:19.680]   Mariella woke up on a day like any other. She arose, got dressed, gathered her belongings,
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.960]   and walked to her place of work. But on this particular day, her walk was interrupted by
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.080]   the body of a man who had stumbled through town talking and screaming to himself, and then
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:35.360]   collapsed dead on the sidewalk. And although she would soon turn to go call for an ambulance,
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:41.760]   for just a few brief moments, she considered the strange man. He was obviously crazy,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:47.200]   this much she knew. Everyone knows what crazy people look like. And in that moment,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:54.480]   she thought to herself how lucky she was to be normal. "I am sane. I am in control of my mind.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:02.080]   I know what is real and what isn't." It was comforting to think this, and in a certain way,
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:07.280]   seeing this man made her feel better. But then she remembered the meeting she had scheduled for
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.800]   that day. The very important people whose impressions of her would affect her career,
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:19.040]   and by extension, the rest of her life. She had no time for this. So it was only a moment
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:24.080]   that she stood there, staring down at the body. And then she turned and ran.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:32.080]   [Music]
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.800]   The end is never the end. This is starting to ring even more true.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:46.000]   Once more into the breach, dear friends. All of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.560]   Stanley decided to go to the meeting room. Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:57.600]   Where's 420? 421, 422. This must be 420.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.840]   Elon, I'm telling you, the guy sleeps all day. It's ridiculous.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:08.880]   When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:15.520]   To be honest, I don't even like Beyonce, so I don't know why I went to the left last time.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.360]   Let us go. Against the rules.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:30.960]   Case of the Mondays.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:38.000]   A beautiful room. What a gorgeous, gorgeous room. Thank goodness Stanley had taken this
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.120]   detour on his way to the meeting room. Life without having experienced this room
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.680]   was now too horrible even to consider. Sarcasm.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:53.360]   But eager to get back to business, Stanley took the first open door on his left.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:59.840]   And so he detoured through the maintenance section, walked straight ahead to the opposite door,
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.120]   and got back on track.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:17.920]   Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.220]   Chris.
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:27.360]   Something about a door being locked always makes you think that there's something fun
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.560]   on the other side of that door.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:39.040]   Stanley just sat around, yet incredibly, by simply pushing random buttons on the keypad,
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.000]   Stanley happened to input the correct code by show of hands.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.280]   The randomness is an illusion.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.080]   Amazing. He stepped into the newly opened passageway.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.320]   Her life is in your hands, dude. Her life is in your hands.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.440]   The rug is missing. That rug really tied the room together.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.720]   Somebody's actually listening to this, they'd be like, "What is he talking about?"
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.280]   Red button.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:08.560]   Nothing ever goes wrong when you press the red button.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.080]   It's always becoming mundane, this escaping of the Matrix.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.080]   Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read "Mind Control Facility".
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:25.440]   Despite what I previously said, there not being an escape,
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.800]   if there is an escape, it surely has an arrow pointing towards it.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.680]   Although this passageway had the word "Escape" written on it,
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.320]   the truth was that at the end of this hall, Stanley would meet his violent death.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.360]   Uh...
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.680]   The door behind him was not shut.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:52.080]   Stanley still had every opportunity to turn around and get back on track.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.280]   What would Goggins do?
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.480]   At this point, Stanley was making a conscious, concerted effort to walk forward
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.480]   and willingly confront his death.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.800]   I'm ready.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.920]   [Sigh]
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:15.840]   That's exactly how I imagined death.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:24.240]   A hole in the floor you step into.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.160]   As the machine whirred into motion and Stanley was inched closer and closer to his demise,
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.240]   it reflected that his life had been of no consequence whatsoever.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.480]   Stanley can't see the bigger picture.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.560]   He doesn't know the real story,
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.400]   trapped forever in his narrow vision of what this world is.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.280]   Perhaps his death was of no great loss, like plugging the eyeballs from a blind man.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.520]   So he resigned and willingly accepted this violent end to his brief and shallow life.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.520]   [Laughter]
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.200]   Uh... no, well, there we go.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.320]   "Farewell, Stanley," cried the narrator,
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.160]   as Stanley was led helplessly into the enormous metal jaws.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.960]   In a single visceral instant, Stanley was obliterated,
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.360]   as the machine crushed every bone in his body, killing him instantly.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.880]   [Gunshot]
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.760]   I'm not dead.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.760]   This is Austin Powers.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.920]   I am just badly hurt.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.960]   [Laughter]
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.760]   It's the Will Ferrell character, when he gets dropped in a chair and there's like a room with flames.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   I am just badly burnt.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.800]   I am not dead.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   I don't know if that's what he says, but that's how I remember it.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.880]   Stanley Parable.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.280]   And yet it would be just a few minutes before Stanley would restart the game,
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.600]   back in his office, as alive as ever.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.440]   What exactly did the narrator think he was going to accomplish?
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:08.400]   When every path you can walk has been created for you long in advance,
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.680]   death becomes meaningless, making life the same.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.280]   Do you see now?
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:18.080]   Do you see that Stanley was already dead from the moment he hit start?
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.160]   I was already dead from the moment I hit start.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.760]   Well, it's about that time that I, uh...
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.240]   Let's get off this ride.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:31.440]   But like the game said, the end is never the end.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.680]   Quick shout out to the sponsors.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.000]   Trial Labs, for your AI.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.520]   And Vincero Watches, for mapping your trajectory through the space-time continuum,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.160]   in style, and with class.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.320]   Check them out in the description.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:57.120]   For a, perhaps, momentary escape from the meaningless existence
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   of your day-to-day office life.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.720]   The cargo lift, it's all in here.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:09.200]   Damn, Sam Harris, you win again.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.720]   It all was just an illusion.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.480]   Game Design Mock-Up.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.160]   The simulation started as a mock-up,
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.000]   and the release version launched with a big bang.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.480]   This is exactly what happens at the end.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:36.000]   You stand looking in a museum at all the options that were before you,
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.640]   and all the choices that you made.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:44.080]   Laid out, in all of its simplicity.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.520]   The office, the props, all here.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.760]   The light from the external world that can never be reached.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.320]   The bike, that I never got to ride.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:04.000]   Early in development, we designed an ending where Stanley would end up on a battlefield
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.280]   fighting aliens.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:09.920]   The action game would become sentient and would wage war against the narrator.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.800]   We realized shortly after starting to build it,
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.560]   that it was far too jokey and on the nose for the tone of the game.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.120]   Plus, some people interpreted it as making fun of people who like shooters,
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.440]   which was not our intention.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.480]   The CRT monitors were back to the beginning,
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.960]   at the end.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.200]   Freedom Ending.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.160]   This was the very first incarnation of the freedom ending in the game's alpha.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.360]   But, where is the freedom ending?
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.120]   There's a freedom ending?
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.000]   I think that's just teasing us.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.160]   There's no escape.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.760]   There cannot be a freedom ending.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.360]   Freedom ending.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.160]   This is the freedom ending as it has existed in beta.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.960]   But, but, but is there a freedom ending?
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.600]   Where is the freedom ending?
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.840]   I wanna know.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:11.040]   There can't, there's no freedom ending.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.000]   I wanna know.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.160]   Ah yes, a dark hallway into a room.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.160]   The on off switch, let us go.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.720]   Oh look at these two.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.600]   How they wish to destroy one another.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.760]   How they wish to control one another.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.400]   How they both wish to be free.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:39.120]   Can you see?
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.400]   Can you see how much they need one another?
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:42.640]   Yes.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.720]   No, perhaps not.
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.440]   Sometimes these things cannot be seen.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.920]   But listen to me, you can still save these two.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.880]   You can stop the program before they both fail.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.880]   Push escape and press quit.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.360]   There's no other way to beat this game.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.880]   As long as you move forward, you'll be walking someone else's path.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.840]   Stop now, you're your only true choice.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.920]   Whatever you do, choose it.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:10.720]   Don't let time...
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:16.000]   I pressed escape.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.360]   The game is now paused.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.760]   See, that didn't work.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.160]   The lady said it didn't work.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.360]   There's no escape.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.160]   Must resume.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   ...you don't have time to...
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.840]   Yep.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.720]   The voices never tell you the truth.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.040]   Darkness.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.800]   Is this what afterlife is like?
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.480]   Sitting there looking at a blank screen wondering if it froze.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.920]   At least it's not a blue screen of death.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:45.840]   I'm somehow profoundly shaken by the combination
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.320]   of the fact that I couldn't escape my own mortality.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.680]   And yet I saw a painting that in alpha and beta versions
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.080]   there was a way to escape and get to freedom.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.200]   Perhaps in the final release there's no escape.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.480]   Let us all keep looking though.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.600]   I hope a couple of you that are still watching this
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.280]   enjoyed coming along for the journey through the
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.560]   simulated existential crisis that is this game.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.480]   I found it to be pretty awesome.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.800]   Actually, it was kind of fun.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.120]   In a dark, Russian kind of way.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.480]   All right.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.960]   All you all, happy new year.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:27.600]   you
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:28.640]   you
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
