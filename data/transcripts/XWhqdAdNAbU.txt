[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.740]   the Quant Revolution.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.560]   Hi, everyone. My name is Rick Ferry, and I am the host of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.180]   This episode, as with all episodes, is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.320]   Literacy, a nonprofit organization that is building a world of well-informed, capable,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.480]   and empowered investors. Visit the Bogle Center at boglecenter.net, where you will find a treasure
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.300]   drover of information, including transcripts of these podcasts.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:28.440]   I have one announcement today. I'm excited to announce that the tickets for the 2025 Bogleheads
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:37.320]   Conference will go on sale in May on boglecenter.net. The conference will be in San Antonio this year,
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.700]   October 17th through the 19th, at the Hyatt Riverwalk, a beautiful location right across from the Alamo.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.280]   And we have some fantastic guests. The agenda will be up on boglecenter.net soon. I'm looking
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.060]   forward to seeing everyone there. In today's podcast, we're going to look at trading, stock
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.820]   trading particularly, but also commodities trading, currency trading, and even Bitcoin trading. At this
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.440]   point, you may be asking yourself, why is the Bogleheads on Investing podcast talking about
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:24.240]   trading? I mean, Bogleheads are going to be mostly buy, hold, rebalance using a few good index funds. That's
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:34.260]   the concept. That's the philosophy. But many of us have tried to earn an extra buck with trading.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.120]   And these investments that we make are short term to intermediate term. They're not
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.960]   in our minds to be held forever. It's not like buying a total stock market index fund where you're
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.860]   going to hold it forever. These are investments that you think there's an opportunity to get in
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.140]   at a particular price point. And then at some time down the road might be a month, might be six months,
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.160]   might be a year, might be three years. You're going to sell them at a profit. And it all sounds good.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.540]   There's lots of books written about this. The big book that came out when I came into the business more
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.040]   than 35 years ago was one up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch, the iconic Fidelity Magellan manager at
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.540]   the time, talking about how individual ambassadors can get in and buy stocks and make money by trading
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.800]   stocks. That's formed a whole industry of investment clubs and people getting together to do it the Peter
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.640]   Lynch way. Didn't work out well for a lot of folks, particularly a group called the Beardstown Ladies,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.340]   which was an investment club out of Illinois, who wrote many books about how they beat the market when
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.300]   in fact, if you research it, they did not beat the market. It turned out that the club members were
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.140]   making a mistake in how they were calculating their investment returns. And it was quite an embarrassment
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.660]   to those people. But the idea of going out and buying stock or buying gold or buying Bitcoin or
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.160]   whatever you're going to buy and having it go up in value and then selling it is something that many
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:30.600]   people believe they can develop the skills to do with success. When in fact, it is extremely difficult.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.340]   Why do people believe that? Why did I believe it before I became a passive index fund believer?
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:49.780]   Well, the financial press is focused on this. Turn on Bloomberg or CNBC and it's all about the trade.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.520]   You know, what traders are doing today, what trade you can make based upon current economic conditions
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:07.180]   and an infinite amount of other suggestions that is put forward by the financial press, investment
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.800]   advisors, brokers. This is trading for the short to intermediate term. What we're going to focus on
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:26.120]   today is the other side of the trade, which is when you buy something or sell something, who is on the
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:38.740]   other side of that trade and why it is increasingly difficult to make money consistently doing these
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.640]   trades. Now, we know when you buy something, there's a 50% chance in the short term, it's going to go up
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.740]   and 50% chance it's going to go down. But it's actually less than 50% because just like going to Las Vegas
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.260]   and putting your money down on the roulette wheel or putting your money on the slot machines, the house
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.620]   has the advantage. But how big is that advantage? And that's what we're going to talk about today.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:09.520]   Who are these firms that are out there waiting to trade against you? And how sophisticated are they?
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:20.080]   What tools are they using to squeeze money from us and push the odds against us? And to help tell this story,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:28.560]   our guest today is Gregory Zuckerman. Greg is the author of several books, but the book we're going to be
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.660]   focusing on today is The Man Who Solved the Market, How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:43.620]   Greg is a special writer at the Wall Street Journal. He writes about financial firms, personalities and
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:51.240]   trades, as well as hedge funds and other investing and business topics. He's a three-time winner of the
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.920]   Gerald Loeb Award, the highest honor in business journalism. With no further ado, let me introduce
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.260]   to Greg Zuckerman. Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, Greg.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.140]   Great to be here.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.420]   Greg, the Bogleheads, as you may know, are mostly passive do-it-yourself investors who
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:15.300]   use index funds and just a simple portfolio in a long-term buy and hold, rebalance, sort of
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.560]   John Bogle philosophy of investing. But we're always interesting in what's going on on the other side.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:29.100]   And you're a man who has studied the other side. And I'm speaking about hedge funds who use
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:37.060]   black box quantitative investing models and lots of sophisticated mathematics to try to
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.380]   outmaneuver everyone else out there. And some of these funds make billions of dollars. And you wrote
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:50.280]   a book called The Man Who Solved the Market, How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution. And Jim Simons
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.880]   was the founder of Renaissance Technologies. We'll get into that book in a little bit. But before we do,
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.860]   could you tell us a little bit about your background and the several books that you've
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.660]   written and how you came around to writing this book?
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:10.180]   Sure. I've been at the Wall Street Journal since 1996, a very long time, covered a bunch of different
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.360]   beats, credit markets, wrote to her on the street, private equity. But I spent many years writing about
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.160]   hedge funds. And I've written several books. My first book is called The Greatest Trade Ever,
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:28.300]   about the subprime trade, people who anticipated the financial meltdown, 2007 and 2008, and John Paulson
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.400]   and some others. Then I got really excited about the energy revolution in this country. I wrote a book
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:39.020]   called The Frackers about that revolution and who the people were and individuals, unlikely individuals.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.320]   And I also wrote a book about the COVID vaccines, how we developed them, the race for the vaccines,
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.880]   the long race, actually, surprising race. And that's called The Shot to Save the World. And then I've
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.200]   written some books with my sons. But the book in particular you mentioned is called, yeah,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.560]   you had mentioned about Jim Simons, the man who solved the market. And yeah, a lot of what I do at the
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.600]   Wall Street Journal are write about, I write about home runs and strikeouts. I'm a sports guy. I like
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:16.580]   to write about those who do really embarrassing mistakes, make embarrassing mistakes. And those
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:23.620]   who do smart, make smart decisions, and it pays off. And those are the home runs. So there's a lot of
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.680]   drama and a lot of lessons from the home runs and strikeouts. And yeah, that's kind of a passion of
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.080]   mind, writing about smart decisions and import decisions over time.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:40.980]   A lot of investors out there believe that when they get home from work, they can get on their
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:49.240]   laptop computer. They can check a few stocks that they like, look at the technicals, maybe some of the
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:58.240]   fundamentals, read some of the articles that are out there, and decide that they're going to buy this
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:07.380]   stock. And if the stock does well, they tend to congratulate ourselves on being smart,
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:15.540]   sophisticated. But in fact, it was probably just luck. And I say that because after reading
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:23.720]   numerous books about hedge funds, your book, I even read Jim Cramer's book, The Confessions of a Street
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.780]   Addict. And I used to use that in one of my classes that I taught at college. I read Michael Lewis's book,
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:36.960]   Flash Boys, about high-frequency trading. Every time I read one of these books, I come away thinking,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:44.860]   how on earth does an individual investor who's plinking around on their home computer compete
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.740]   against these people? And I always wanted to get your thoughts about that.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:56.880]   So taking a step back, I started writing about the world of finance, early 90s, and I got to the
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:03.200]   journal in 1996. And a lot of what I ended up doing are writing about the winners, the success stories,
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:10.540]   those who anticipate world events, those who discover underappreciated investments, securities,
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:18.700]   be it in the credit markets or inequities. And in some ways, I've done a disservice to mankind,
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:26.280]   to humankind, in that, yeah, one can read Greg Zuckerman's work and say, wow, I can beat the market. But
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:36.660]   I hope people don't come away with that conclusion. And over time, I've arrived at my own conclusion that
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.580]   it is, if not impossible, really hard to beat the market. And it's gotten much harder, partly because
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:50.560]   you're going up against the quants. So there was a time when there was a possibility of gaining an
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:59.180]   information advantage. Even an individual could. It's rare today. So markets are much more efficient.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:07.320]   Information flows much quicker than ever. It's a fair market in a lot of different ways. I can tell
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.420]   you so many stories of hedge funds and others just having a meeting with the CEO. I remember
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:20.960]   the Steinhardt people telling me about how Lou Gerstner at IBM came in the office one day and kind
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.660]   of outlined what he was going to do. And they were like, look at each other like, wow, we got to back up
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.120]   the truck here. And they did. And they made a fortune. You can't do that today. That's breaking
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.880]   Reg FD. So I hope people don't come away from my book saying, I'm going to do this at home.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.900]   No, not at all. I mean, that's exactly the opposite of how I come away from these books. Because after I
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:47.820]   finish reading the book, I say to myself, these people have access to information and databases that
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:53.760]   I couldn't even dream of even getting access to, let alone being able to data mine this information
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:01.060]   using the now quantum computers that some of these companies are using. And the people that these
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:06.840]   companies hire, they're mathematicians, they're PhDs, physicists, I mean, dozens and dozens in your book
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:14.120]   talk about how Jim Simon and his co-CEOs would go out and just literally hire dozens of the smartest
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.060]   people out there to come in and try to build these algorithms.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:22.200]   Yeah, it's harder than ever. If you're going to do relatively short term investing,
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.340]   especially then you're going up against Jim Simons, well, not him any longer, but
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:34.600]   his colleagues at Renaissance. And it's it's folly. It's just a fool's errand to try to think you're
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.780]   going to beat them in terms of short or medium term investing. I do have to say that if you're going to
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:48.060]   be a longer term investor, that's not where the big guns on Wall Street are focused on. So there is an
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:56.220]   opportunity there and you can even take advantage of their short term nature. Sometimes stocks on a
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:02.740]   short term basis move in a volatile way and you can take advantage as a calm, patient, longer term
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.740]   investors. There's still opportunity there, I believe. But generally speaking, you've got to realize that
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:15.280]   you're going up against it used to be you'd go up against, let's say, Peter Lynch or Jeff Vinnick and
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:23.220]   Fidelity. And that was hard enough. But now about 80 percent of trading on Wall Street is based on some
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:30.160]   algorithm of some kind. It's not to say that they've figured out the secret sauce. They don't outperform
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.680]   necessarily any more than people did in the past, even though it's more automated. So I wouldn't worry about
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:42.220]   that so much. There's still the same inefficiencies out there and potential opportunities, but it's just
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:50.520]   harder to get an advantage, any kind of information or otherwise. Goldman Sachs just announced their
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:59.760]   earnings and they were record-breaking earnings from equity trading. There was a 27 percent increase
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:07.600]   year-over-per-year. They made $4.19 billion in equity trading. Now this comes out of the market. I mean,
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:17.520]   you know, where there's profits that they received. Now part of that was through proprietary trading, which is Goldman Sachs
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:25.040]   engaging in their own trading for their own book, where they're making markets. And in addition to these hedge funds,
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:33.560]   you've got JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and all these big Wall Street firms that are also involved in this
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:39.000]   day-to-day. And they're all generally making a lot of money. I just want to go through some of the
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.760]   big prop trading companies out there. DRW,
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.160]   Cintadell,
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.280]   Jane Street,
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.520]   Optiver,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.420]   Hudson River Trading,
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.540]   Tower Research.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.420]   Then you have Two Sigma,
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.140]   you have the hedge funds,
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.940]   the Renaissance Technologies,
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.620]   and so forth. I mean, there's just dozens of
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.560]   big companies out there that are trying to
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.820]   make money
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.720]   doing algorithmic trading.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.600]   And they are. I mean, they're making big money.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.040]   And this all comes out of the markets.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   So, like you said,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.120]   80 percent of the trading that's going on
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.980]   is all of this.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.420]   And to me,
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.020]   as an index investor,
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.940]   should I be concerned about this?
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.460]   No, I don't think so.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.700]   There always have been
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.940]   big investors on Wall Street and elsewhere
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.460]   doing prop kind of trading.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.220]   If anything,
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.040]   the prop trading
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.420]   that big firms,
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.460]   investment banks,
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.500]   Goldman Sachs,
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:37.960]   and such
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.160]   do today
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.480]   pales in comparison
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.280]   with what they used to do.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.940]   like Salomon Brothers
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.760]   back in the day
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.360]   was just a prop trading
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.200]   behemoth.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.220]   And today,
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.060]   because of different regulatory changes,
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.500]   banks just don't
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.440]   take those kind of
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.380]   chances anymore,
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.480]   Goldman Sachs and others.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.180]   So they do some
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.860]   prop trading,
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.320]   very little.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.660]   But yeah,
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.680]   it's shifted elsewhere.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.180]   And people are making a fortune.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.000]   I think the real money comes
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.240]   out of the pockets
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:05.740]   of
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.040]   the big endowments,
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.200]   the big institutional funds,
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.400]   the ones that are clients,
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:09.840]   frankly,
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.020]   of these firms.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.520]   I mean,
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.580]   they pay such high prices
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.960]   in terms of
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.260]   management fees,
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.180]   incentive fees
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.880]   to the
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.620]   hedge funds
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.660]   and trading firms
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.220]   that they give money to,
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.280]   their clients of.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.120]   And
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.460]   it's just
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.940]   a great business
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.220]   for those
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:28.960]   who do the trading
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.600]   but not
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.740]   for the clients.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.520]   So then you say to yourself,
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:31.760]   well,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.940]   why are they doing it?
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.080]   Why are all these
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.900]   institutions
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.020]   handing their money over
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.160]   to these investment firms
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.480]   that don't necessarily
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.180]   outperform
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.140]   the market?
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.920]   or I don't even like
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.560]   to say the market
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.280]   because that's not
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.920]   really the alternative.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.640]   Alternative is just
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.220]   sort of a 60-40
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.480]   boring allocation,
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.840]   which I'm a fan of.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.520]   So you're speaking
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.620]   to the converted.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.040]   Why do they do it?
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.320]   I think it's a function
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.980]   of keeping your job.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.340]   So if you're an allocator
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.000]   at a big endowment,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.040]   sovereign wealth fund,
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.700]   what have you,
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.900]   you have a salary,
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.740]   you have a high salary
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.300]   of your own.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.660]   you can't justify it
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.780]   by saying,
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.080]   well,
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.580]   guys,
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.140]   we're going to put
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:09.740]   all the money
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.520]   into Vanguard
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.580]   and we're going
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.440]   to be allocated
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.480]   conservatively
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.140]   and we're going
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:16.960]   to have some equities
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.700]   and exposure
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.560]   and some fixed income,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.060]   et cetera,
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.280]   I mean,
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.000]   a little emerging market.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.880]   You can't do that.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.340]   They're going to be like,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.560]   great idea.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.640]   We're slashing
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.680]   your salary in half.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.320]   We don't need you
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.000]   to be doing that.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:27.800]   Instead,
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.840]   you need to charge
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.240]   someone a lot of money
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.480]   to get you into,
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.320]   like you said,
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.740]   Citadel or Tower Trading
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.520]   or one of these places.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.440]   So there's incentive there
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.480]   for the allocators
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.680]   to allocate
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.140]   to the really expensive
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.040]   trading firms
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.360]   and it hurts.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.400]   It hurts pensioners,
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.080]   pension funds.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.100]   It hurts the sovereign wealth,
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.480]   beneficiaries,
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.120]   et cetera.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:53.980]   So,
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.020]   but in terms of you and I,
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.300]   it shouldn't really affect us.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.080]   It makes the market
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.800]   much more volatile.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.920]   So if you could take advantage
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.460]   of that,
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.940]   then there's benefit.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.320]   Yeah,
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:03.860]   I guess the way
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.780]   that we would take advantage
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.840]   of a volatile market,
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.900]   say right now,
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.120]   as I've been telling folks,
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.060]   is if the market's down 20%
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.160]   and you have an allocation
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.080]   to 60-40,
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.220]   then your 60 is probably
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.280]   not at 60 anymore.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.380]   It's probably at 50
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.740]   or at least 55.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.220]   So you should probably,
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.880]   with that 5% difference,
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.520]   you should probably be buying stocks.
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.880]   And if the market
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.200]   gets driven up by this
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.100]   and you're at 65% equity,
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.800]   you should probably
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.740]   be selling stocks.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.940]   And that small amount
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.960]   of rebalancing
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.740]   just to stay
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.120]   to a strategic allocation
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.840]   does seem to equate
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.320]   to some free lunch
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:42.780]   out there,
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.680]   if there is one,
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.480]   from just doing that.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.840]   I think that's the way
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.360]   we,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.180]   the public,
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.580]   can maybe take advantage
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.360]   of some of these
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.040]   big dips in the market
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.820]   that seem to occur
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.940]   every three years or so.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.400]   Yeah,
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.580]   there's an argument there.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.620]   The tricky thing,
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.900]   the challenge nowadays
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.620]   is that
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.140]   the fixed income market,
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.020]   the treasury market,
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.820]   is having its own problems
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.400]   just as the equity market
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.680]   comes under pressure.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.900]   So it's not as easy
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.300]   to shift
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.600]   due to equity troubles
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.920]   to fixed income
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.440]   because you're getting
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:16.860]   losses.
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.480]   But if you're a long-term investor,
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.260]   then you shouldn't worry
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.080]   about these blips.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.160]   And yeah,
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.300]   I've got two young sons
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.180]   and I tell them
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.160]   dollar cost averaging
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.320]   and don't worry
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.580]   about the ups and downs.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.180]   But of course,
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:27.880]   they ignore me.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.480]   How young are they?
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.440]   Ah,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.440]   they're in their 20s.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.420]   I often tell people
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.960]   that when it comes
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.320]   to stock trading,
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.080]   people who begin
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.400]   in their 20s or 30s,
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.100]   they think they're going
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.060]   to maybe pick some stocks
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.280]   that are going to outperform
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:46.940]   in the short term,
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.520]   you know, trading.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.800]   And if they happen
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.880]   to pick a few stocks
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.420]   that went up,
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.460]   they think they actually
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.300]   have skill
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.700]   rather than luck.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.100]   It's almost like
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.840]   picking up a used set
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.600]   of golf clubs
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.140]   and going out
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.980]   on the golf course
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.640]   and hitting around
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.740]   and making a couple
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.760]   of long putts
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.220]   and thinking,
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:04.960]   oh, now I'm ready
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.660]   for the Masters.
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.360]   You might think that,
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.060]   but you're not going
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:09.660]   to make the cut.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.060]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.240]   And listen,
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:11.880]   there are some people
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.460]   who are great
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.580]   at trading individuals
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.220]   and such
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.400]   and have a touch for it
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.320]   and good for them.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.900]   But generally speaking,
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.940]   they focus on their winners
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.680]   and not their losers
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.060]   and their exceptions
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.860]   to the rule.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.620]   So for every one of those,
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.380]   there are more
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.720]   that cannot beat the market.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.340]   So I want to get into
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.840]   your book
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.140]   because it follows
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.380]   the life
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.300]   of one of these
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.080]   hedge fund managers,
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.360]   really,
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.560]   you could call him
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.540]   the father
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.500]   of the quantitative
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.540]   trading movement.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.040]   Definitely, definitely.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.660]   His name is Jim Simons
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.480]   and he founded
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.820]   Renaissance Technology,
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.560]   which is one of the
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.580]   very big
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.480]   quantitative trading firms
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.120]   and very,
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.060]   very successful.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.760]   why him?
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.100]   I mean,
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.000]   there were other people.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.380]   There was George Soros.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.280]   There was Steve Cohen,
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.820]   David Shaw,
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.720]   Ken Griffin from Citadel.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.540]   Why Jim Simons?
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.380]   So I wrote a book
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.540]   about Jim Simons
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.400]   and his colleagues
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.020]   at Renaissance
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.380]   because they have
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.740]   the greatest track record
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.380]   in investing history.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.620]   I don't know if you call them
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.220]   traders or investors.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.000]   I just call them money makers.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.920]   On average,
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.020]   their medallion fund,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.580]   which is their key hedge fund,
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.840]   is up about 66%
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.180]   a year
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.940]   for decades and decades
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.580]   since inception.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.640]   So there's no one
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.460]   really close.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.320]   That's before fees.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.220]   They have enormous fees
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:33.840]   but they also
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.060]   have kicked out
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.400]   almost every one
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.860]   of their outside investors
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.940]   so they charge themselves
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.520]   these fees.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.840]   So I set out
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.480]   to figure out
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.960]   how they developed
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.760]   such a money making machine
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.920]   and to me
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.080]   there's a fascinating history.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.260]   Jim Simons is unique.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.100]   The people there
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:50.580]   are unique.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.700]   They're not investors.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.400]   They're not people
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.440]   from the world of finance.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.140]   They're not people
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.000]   of MBAs.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.580]   You would think,
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:55.800]   I mean,
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.340]   there's a paradox
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.840]   behind all my books.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.260]   All the books
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:22:59.640]   I've written.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.340]   After I've kind of
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.040]   dug into them
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.900]   and spent time on them
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.480]   I realized
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.260]   there's something
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.000]   propelling me.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.700]   There's some reason
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.720]   why I'm so fascinated
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.420]   by the story
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.420]   and it's a paradox.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.100]   It shouldn't have been
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.820]   these people.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.280]   It shouldn't have been
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.960]   Jim Simons
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.100]   and his colleagues
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.460]   who mastered the market
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.440]   who solved the market
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.280]   as it were.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.520]   They're people
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.140]   who don't necessarily
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.180]   care about companies
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.140]   and earnings
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.020]   and the future
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.360]   and business even.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.560]   Some aren't even
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.240]   capitalists
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   within the verb.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.720]   I noticed that
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.300]   in the book,
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:28.680]   by the way.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.400]   some are not even
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.040]   capitalists.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:30.320]   Yeah,
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:30.940]   it's fascinating.
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.880]   They're scientists
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.700]   and they're mathematicians
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.700]   and Jim recruited
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.800]   from that world.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.420]   He literally
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.360]   didn't want people
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:39.960]   from the world
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.400]   of finance,
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.320]   people who knew
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.160]   something about business
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.620]   and trading
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.260]   and investing.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.200]   He wanted them
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.080]   to come fresh
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.280]   to this challenge
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.120]   and that's how
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.760]   they looked at it.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.520]   It was a challenge
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.980]   to figure out markets
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.580]   like any other
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.200]   kind of scientific experiment
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.560]   and they set out
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   and they set out
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.400]   to do it
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.900]   out in Long Island
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.060]   far from Wall Street
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.520]   at a time
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.700]   where there wasn't
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.320]   any quantitative
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.480]   trading going on.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.320]   They were the pioneers.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.260]   They became the pioneers
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.380]   and they changed everything.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.480]   So I set out
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.360]   to write a book
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:07.840]   to explain
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.600]   how it all happened.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.100]   So let's first start
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.680]   at who Jim Simons is.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.560]   Where did he go to school?
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.800]   What was his education?
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.140]   And what did he do
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.060]   prior to deciding
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.520]   to get into
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.440]   the investment world?
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.340]   Sure.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.180]   So Jim Simons
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.920]   grew up outside of Boston
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.360]   in Newton, Massachusetts.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.540]   Went to MIT
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.640]   and always loved mathematics
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.240]   and his family
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.040]   pediatrician
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.060]   kind of warned him
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.720]   that don't go
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.240]   into mathematics.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.300]   You can't make any money
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.040]   on mathematics.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.660]   You should be a doctor
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.460]   like I am.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.800]   And he ended up
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.480]   being worth
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.160]   at his death
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.960]   last year,
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.420]   he was worth
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.380]   about $27 billion.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.720]   So the pediatrician
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.680]   didn't give great
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.780]   career advice
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:44.760]   and luckily Jim Simons
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.960]   ignored what his
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.780]   pediatrician said.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.100]   And at first
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.580]   he went into academia
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.200]   and he got a PhD
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.520]   and was a geometer.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.920]   Focused on that.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.720]   He taught both
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.740]   at MIT and Harvard.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.960]   But he always had
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.020]   this kind of
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.020]   wandering eye.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.860]   Always had one foot
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.760]   in the world
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.240]   of academia
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.020]   and one foot
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.040]   in the real world.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.020]   He took some time off
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.680]   to work for a government
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.520]   government arm
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.680]   during the Cold War
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.840]   and did code breaking
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.780]   against the Russians
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.680]   and learned there
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   how to build
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.580]   predictive algorithms
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.460]   early on
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.720]   and also how to work
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.400]   with just super smart
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.800]   borderline genius
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.140]   mathematicians
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.000]   and how they could
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.920]   all work together
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.980]   for a common cause
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.700]   and that was a real
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.460]   lesson for him.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.760]   He went back
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.420]   into academia,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.020]   led the mathematics
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.580]   department
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.200]   at Stony Brook
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.260]   on Long Island
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.520]   and there too
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.140]   learned how to
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.800]   recruit talent
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.420]   and get them
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.080]   to work together
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.320]   and create incentives
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.640]   and frankly
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.440]   about my book
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.100]   so yeah
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:43.720]   it's called
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.460]   The Man Who Solved
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:44.840]   the Market
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.720]   it's about investing
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.220]   and trading
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:46.580]   I guess
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.980]   but a lot of it
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.800]   is just management
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.560]   and after I finished
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:50.820]   the book
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.220]   I realized
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:51.780]   it's as much
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.460]   a management book
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:52.920]   as it is
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.220]   an investing book
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:54.840]   because it's about
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   how to recruit
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.040]   talent,
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.840]   top talent
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.260]   and get them
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.180]   to work together
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.520]   and it's very unique
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.960]   and Jim had that skill
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.760]   he was a fascinating
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.260]   individual
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.660]   because he was
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.620]   a quant
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.240]   he was a mathematician
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.280]   he goes down
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:07.920]   as one of the greatest
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.380]   geometers
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:08.940]   of the last few
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.500]   hundred years
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.380]   his work is still
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:10.880]   referenced
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.480]   over and over again
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.920]   and he led
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.960]   academic departments
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.420]   and such
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.380]   but he also
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.680]   is really
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.720]   personable
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.580]   or he was personable
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.200]   he passed away
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:21.900]   again last year
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.360]   very personable
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:23.880]   funny
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.440]   and more
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.160]   than anything
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.200]   he understands
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.060]   he understood
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.580]   people
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.700]   and how to get
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.120]   them to work
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:30.400]   together
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:30.820]   and creating
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.380]   incentives
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.540]   to do so
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.720]   fascinating
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.160]   background
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.040]   having been
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.460]   a military
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:35.860]   person
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.500]   I really like
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.200]   the code breaking
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.240]   part of the story
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.100]   the government
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.020]   recruited
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.980]   the smartest
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.400]   people
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.560]   they could find
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.280]   for that job
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.460]   but then
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.380]   at some point
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.800]   he leaves
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.600]   code breaking
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.660]   and academia
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.820]   and decides
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.000]   to open up
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.900]   a little
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.600]   mom and pop
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.420]   investment shop
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.000]   it appears
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.500]   yeah
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.100]   that's exactly
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:55.320]   right
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.100]   Jim always
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.040]   traded on the side
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.820]   he did have
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.220]   a love
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.100]   of markets
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.040]   and a love
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:00.640]   of money
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.760]   and he wasn't
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.440]   ashamed
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.400]   in any way
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:03.960]   embarrassed
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.040]   by that
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.500]   passion
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.380]   to become
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:06.720]   really
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.440]   wealthy
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.420]   and rich
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.080]   he was a
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:09.680]   unique academic
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.340]   in that regard
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:10.880]   his colleagues
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.380]   didn't share
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:11.900]   that passion
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.720]   for money
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.480]   so he left
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.820]   to start
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.520]   a trading firm
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.580]   and frankly
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.620]   his instinct
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.380]   was that
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.780]   markets
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.500]   have patterns
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.940]   that people
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.580]   aren't
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.260]   sufficiently
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.180]   appreciative of
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.000]   there are
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.140]   hidden patterns
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:27.820]   that he can
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.340]   identify
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:28.880]   that's what
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.300]   his goal
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:29.580]   was
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.360]   to identify
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.840]   hidden patterns
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.560]   be it short term
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.180]   or long term
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.240]   but frankly
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.120]   from 1978
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.820]   when he started
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.860]   until about 1992
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.880]   he went back and forth
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.400]   he couldn't quite
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.140]   figure it out
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.840]   he started as a quant
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.640]   and then he ended up
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.460]   just trading
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.040]   like you and I
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.940]   with our instincts
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.600]   and intuition
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.380]   judgment
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.360]   he bought gold
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.220]   and sold gold
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.200]   and bought silver
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.460]   and sold silver
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.740]   and did pretty
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.100]   well
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.480]   but he couldn't
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:54.940]   handle it
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.520]   physically
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.000]   frankly
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.880]   his stomach
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.860]   hurt him
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.540]   and the ups
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.080]   and downs
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.880]   were just too much
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.740]   and then finally
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.580]   he just turned it
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.180]   all over to the
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:02.620]   machines
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:03.920]   and hired enough
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.840]   talent to be able
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.480]   to do so
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.340]   and they figured
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:07.900]   out first
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.180]   with fixed income
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.900]   and currencies
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.120]   and commodities
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.280]   but then finally
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:12.960]   turned the corner
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.820]   and it was people
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.820]   he recruited
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.360]   that did it
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:15.880]   that figured out
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.680]   how to make a lot
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:16.900]   of money
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.480]   with equities
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.120]   the idea
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.440]   of looking
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.020]   for patterns
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:20.440]   of course
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.060]   would go back
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.600]   to his code
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.220]   breaker days
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.660]   yes
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.780]   you said he was
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.860]   he had brought
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.400]   in some very
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.240]   very skilled people
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.940]   one of the people
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.600]   he brought in
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.460]   who was a skilled
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.420]   mathematician
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.640]   was Lenny Balm
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.340]   he also brought in
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.960]   Jesse Axe
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.320]   from Stoney
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.840]   who were these people
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.800]   these were also
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.660]   brilliant people
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.780]   top of their fields
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.600]   Jim Axe
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.820]   came from Cornell
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.180]   and Simons
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.140]   was able to recruit
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.200]   him and give him
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:46.820]   reason to come
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.500]   to Stony Brook
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.120]   which was not
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.200]   a well respected
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.320]   math department
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.180]   at the time
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.120]   Lenny Balm
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.660]   was the top
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.320]   of his field
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   yeah these were
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.820]   some of the greatest
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.540]   mathematicians
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.180]   of the time
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.420]   and Jim had a way
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.480]   he kind of said
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   oh yeah you don't
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.460]   care about hedge funds
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.520]   and trading
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.220]   or investing
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.300]   it's beneath you
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.440]   well come over
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.920]   spend a day with us
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.600]   let me give you
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.140]   some exposure
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:09.920]   to what we're doing
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.500]   over here
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.660]   and they saw
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.320]   what we all see
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.020]   what a challenge
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:14.980]   it is to beat
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.420]   the market
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.800]   and there's nothing
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.840]   a great mathematician
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.580]   or scientist
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.420]   likes more than
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.740]   a real challenge
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.640]   and also they got
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.480]   to see the talent
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.120]   so once he got
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.600]   some of the top
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.500]   most talented
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.200]   mathematicians
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:27.640]   to come over
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.200]   and scientists
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.680]   others wanted to come
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.600]   and be able to work
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.340]   with each other
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:31.900]   and that kind of
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.520]   environment
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.880]   was really appealing
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.840]   and then
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.760]   once they were
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.300]   there
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.020]   once he got them
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.060]   to join
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.600]   spend some time
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.300]   they started
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:40.940]   making money
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.300]   and you know
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:42.980]   as well as I do
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.580]   once you start
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.400]   making a lot of money
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.140]   it's hard to go back
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.640]   to not making money
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640]   what I found
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.380]   interesting about
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.000]   the book was
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.920]   he started out
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.680]   looking for patterns
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.360]   but couldn't really
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.020]   find any
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:52.480]   and then he just
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.500]   kind of reverted
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.420]   back to kind of
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.060]   what we all do
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:55.300]   you know
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:55.860]   intuition
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.380]   gut
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.180]   and so forth
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.880]   they made some
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.620]   good calls
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.640]   but some bad
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.620]   calls as well
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.340]   and then
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.700]   the interesting
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.200]   thing
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.560]   about this story
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.580]   is that
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.880]   Jim Simons
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.520]   decided
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.500]   that's not
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:09.800]   what we're
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.200]   going to do
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:10.620]   anymore
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.360]   we're going
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:11.700]   to go
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.120]   to
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.120]   quantitative
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.320]   investing
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.540]   yeah he
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.240]   never really
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.960]   wanted to
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.360]   develop a firm
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.400]   that was based
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.940]   on instinct
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.800]   and intuition
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.380]   and such
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.640]   he did want
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.440]   to be a quant
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.400]   it just was
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.640]   very hard
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:28.940]   people
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.620]   don't understand
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.320]   how hard it is
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.400]   to turn decisions
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.060]   over to
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.800]   machines
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.420]   even for the
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.040]   most successful
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.760]   mathematicians
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.700]   when I spoke
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.020]   to him
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.420]   we spent
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:38.700]   time
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.120]   together
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.000]   he told
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.460]   me a story
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.200]   about how
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.080]   years later
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.900]   when he had
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.600]   taken a real
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.060]   step back
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:44.660]   from the firm
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.280]   and just was
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.040]   mostly trading
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.540]   for himself
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.040]   and investing
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:47.540]   for himself
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.660]   and he had
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:48.940]   a wealth
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.320]   manager
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:49.780]   and such
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.520]   there was a
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:50.960]   downturn
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.520]   in the market
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.140]   and Jim
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:52.900]   was on vacation
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.540]   he's in the
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.100]   hotel
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:54.480]   I think it was
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.180]   the Beverly Hills
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.520]   Hotel
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.780]   watching CNBC
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.900]   on the screen
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.440]   as the market
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.000]   collapsed
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.900]   and he called
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.380]   his wealth
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:01.860]   manager up
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.160]   and said
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:02.540]   hey do we
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:02.960]   have shorts
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.140]   on
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:03.340]   should we
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:03.660]   put some
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:03.960]   shorts
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.360]   on here
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.240]   and I said
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:05.700]   to Jim
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.540]   Jim
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:06.800]   Jim
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.100]   you're the
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.920]   pioneering
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.500]   quant
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.280]   you panicked
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.380]   and called
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:12.840]   your broker
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.480]   like anybody
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:13.760]   else
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.560]   like Joe
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:14.880]   Schmo
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.440]   you know
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.960]   like a
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.220]   pediatrician
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:17.560]   dentist
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.000]   you know
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.580]   calling his
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.540]   and he
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.780]   he didn't
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.080]   see the
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:21.340]   humor
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:21.720]   in it
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.480]   as I
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:22.780]   did
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.520]   or
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.100]   he
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:24.320]   wasn't
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:24.440]   as
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:24.880]   surprised
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.340]   but
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.220]   it
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:26.560]   shows
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:26.820]   to me
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.140]   it shows
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:27.640]   how hard
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:27.840]   it is
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.460]   even for
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:28.640]   Jim
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.120]   Simons
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:29.720]   even
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.440]   the
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:30.860]   pioneering
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.380]   quant
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.160]   who had
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:32.260]   the
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:32.640]   breakthrough
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.380]   that changed
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:33.800]   everything
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.880]   he couldn't
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.760]   help himself
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.580]   from calling
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.140]   his broker
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:37.940]   getting a little
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:38.360]   worried about
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:38.780]   the market
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.320]   and putting
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:39.640]   on some
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.040]   shorts
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.080]   using his
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.540]   intuition
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.280]   and just
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.880]   judgment
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.480]   and reacting
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.280]   the fear
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:45.760]   and greed
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.200]   man
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:46.680]   it's
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.220]   behavioral
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:47.740]   economics
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.760]   knows what
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.120]   it's talking
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:49.420]   about
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.040]   so even
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:50.240]   Jim
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:50.660]   Simons
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.100]   succumbs
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.640]   luckily
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.120]   for his
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:52.380]   sake
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:52.740]   and for
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.080]   the firm
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:53.680]   they for
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:53.940]   the most
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.200]   part
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:54.780]   have turned
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.320]   almost every
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:55.720]   decision
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.200]   over to
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:56.680]   the machines
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.720]   and especially
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.220]   today
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.200]   they really
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:31:59.860]   don't
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:00.300]   interfere
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:00.700]   too much
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.240]   I write
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:01.540]   in the book
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:01.760]   a few
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.040]   times
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:02.300]   where they
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:02.800]   step in
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.820]   and stop
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.400]   the trading
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.240]   and interfere
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:05.880]   or adjust
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.280]   the trading
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:06.780]   but it's
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.260]   rare
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:07.960]   I thought
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.460]   the exact
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:08.940]   same thing
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:09.320]   when I was
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:09.680]   reading up
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.040]   so here's
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.560]   a guy
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.000]   who is
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.460]   the father
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.100]   of quantitative
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.540]   analysis
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.620]   who believes
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.140]   so heavily
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.600]   and just
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.060]   letting the
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:15.340]   computer
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:15.800]   do all the
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.000]   work
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.540]   because humans
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:16.880]   can make
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.260]   so many
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:17.660]   mistakes
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.380]   I just
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.300]   laughed
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:19.720]   when I read
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:19.820]   it
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:19.940]   I gave
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:20.360]   the exact
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:20.560]   same
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.060]   conclusion
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:21.420]   that you
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:21.800]   came to
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.100]   your emotions
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:23.800]   get the best
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.020]   of you
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:24.380]   it is so
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.000]   hard to
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.820]   stay disciplined
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.420]   yes
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.320]   even the
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:27.760]   pioneering
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.200]   quantity
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:28.660]   yeah
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.900]   so tell me
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:30.200]   a little bit
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.540]   about the
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:30.960]   types of
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.720]   strategies
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.360]   you found
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:32.760]   that they
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.240]   ended up
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.220]   finding
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:34.900]   more successful
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.580]   like pairs
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.200]   trading
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.680]   arbitrage
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.440]   and so forth
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.260]   what did they
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.420]   find was
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.020]   working for
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:41.260]   them
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.740]   it's a lot
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:43.020]   of stuff
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:43.680]   that's
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:43.980]   either
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.780]   obsolete
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.380]   today
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.600]   or isn't
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.260]   as important
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:47.840]   today
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.340]   yeah
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:48.620]   pairs
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.040]   trading
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:49.300]   is
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.000]   well that was developed
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.040]   by Morgan Stanley
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.260]   actually early on
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.540]   two similar
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.280]   kinds of
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:54.760]   companies
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.200]   I don't know
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.600]   Coke and
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:55.940]   Pepsi
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.360]   BP and
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:57.940]   Shell
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.460]   that kind
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:58.980]   of thing
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.340]   and when
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.660]   their patterns
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.860]   when those
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.220]   stocks
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.920]   don't align
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.820]   when they move
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.200]   in different
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:06.700]   ways
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.380]   or unusual
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:07.980]   ways
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.300]   they would
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.120]   use a lot
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.540]   historic
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.180]   information
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:10.760]   a lot
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.060]   of what
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:11.580]   Jim
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.000]   did
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.620]   was
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.380]   and
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:13.720]   really
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.100]   frankly
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:14.440]   was a
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:14.760]   colleague
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.180]   of his
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:15.500]   Sandra
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:15.960]   Strauss
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.660]   who
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.120]   came up
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:17.360]   with the
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:17.660]   idea
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.140]   is to have
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:18.800]   better data
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.300]   than everybody
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:19.640]   else
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.160]   and today
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:20.640]   it's much
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.200]   easier
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.180]   for the average
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:22.720]   investor
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.180]   be it a
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:23.640]   quant or
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.260]   otherwise
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.220]   to get their
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.400]   hands on
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.060]   almost any
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:27.440]   kind of data
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:27.800]   you want
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.180]   back then
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.080]   it wasn't
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:29.900]   and it wasn't
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.500]   just that Jim
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:30.960]   had better
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.400]   data
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.580]   more data
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:32.940]   than everybody
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.180]   else
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:33.680]   it was better
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.520]   it was cleaner
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.040]   they had this
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.600]   idea of
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.560]   cleaning the
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.080]   data which
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.260]   was unheard
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:38.900]   of back
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.460]   then
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:39.880]   meaning
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.000]   they would
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.380]   go back
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:41.820]   in history
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.300]   and they would
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:42.800]   see let's
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.320]   say silver
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:43.820]   price
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.240]   moved really
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:45.840]   in a weird
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.440]   way
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.100]   a hundred
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.700]   years
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.420]   ago
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.020]   they would
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.580]   look into
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.080]   why it
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.520]   happened
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:51.980]   maybe
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.780]   frankly
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.960]   someone took
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.320]   it down
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:54.880]   incorrectly
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.280]   there was
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:55.540]   some
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.240]   sometimes
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.480]   there would
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:56.840]   be some
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.400]   storm
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.420]   such that
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.100]   there was
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.740]   a gap
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.300]   in a day
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:00.760]   or so
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.660]   in prices
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.260]   and they
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:02.640]   were missing
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.040]   something
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.720]   and they
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.220]   took the
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:04.640]   time
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.480]   to go
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:05.860]   through
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.440]   history
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.520]   and go
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:07.680]   through
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.200]   the prices
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:08.980]   and frankly
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.300]   it was
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:09.880]   painstaking
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.400]   work
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.080]   and thankless
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:11.480]   work
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.080]   and it
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:12.520]   wasn't clear
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:12.740]   what was
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.280]   going to
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:13.700]   lead to
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.060]   anything
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.580]   so people
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:15.980]   always ask
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.120]   me
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.500]   why is he
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:17.920]   so good
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.320]   why is
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:18.720]   renaissance
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.680]   so good
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.460]   and why
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:20.660]   are they
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.040]   better than
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.360]   everybody
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:21.800]   else
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.220]   and I
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:23.660]   argue
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.140]   that it's
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:24.760]   a series
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.780]   of advantages
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.540]   they have
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.160]   and it's
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:27.580]   not always
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.320]   so persuasive
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:28.780]   to people
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.120]   they want
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:29.660]   to know
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.340]   like these
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.160]   secret sauce
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:31.600]   or some
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.200]   secret
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.040]   formula
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.560]   and there
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.120]   isn't any
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.600]   secret formula
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:34.880]   they have
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.220]   certain
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:35.760]   approaches
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.780]   that work
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.920]   but they
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.260]   don't work
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.080]   always
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.600]   but what
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:40.940]   they do
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.380]   is they
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:41.780]   have better
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.260]   talent
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:42.780]   they have
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.500]   better data
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.520]   they clean
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:44.800]   it
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.700]   they incentivize
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.500]   people to work
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.020]   together
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.020]   that's a huge
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.740]   part of it
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:50.720]   they don't have
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.320]   silos
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.020]   on wall street
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:52.420]   you have
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.620]   different groups
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.420]   that compete
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.060]   with each other
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:55.600]   even within
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.000]   their own
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.580]   firm
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.640]   and renaissance
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.420]   has none
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:58.880]   of that
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.540]   everybody's
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:34:59.960]   on the same
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.560]   page
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.020]   and they all
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:01.640]   get paid
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.620]   based on
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.300]   the performance
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:03.720]   of the
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:03.960]   one
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.280]   fund
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.120]   the medallion
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.560]   fund
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.720]   so everyone
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.680]   steps in
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.140]   together
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:08.660]   and it's
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.340]   very flat
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.080]   organization
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.900]   so people
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.460]   chip in
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:11.780]   and maybe
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.220]   there's a new
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.640]   data source
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.920]   that someone
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.420]   finds
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:15.960]   and great
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.460]   good for you
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.000]   that's what
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.240]   you bring
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:18.600]   to the table
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:18.840]   great
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.180]   maybe there's
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:20.800]   some other
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.160]   approach
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:21.660]   you've got
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.380]   a way to
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:22.820]   contribute
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.520]   even incrementally
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.280]   and they just
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:25.880]   get the best
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.360]   talent
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.040]   they are able
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.480]   to hire
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:28.920]   everybody on
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.220]   wall street
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.440]   when I take
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:30.880]   a tour
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.520]   of a trading
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:31.720]   floor
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.060]   they say
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:32.660]   Greg over
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.340]   there are
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.420]   our PhDs
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:34.840]   that's our
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.140]   corner
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:35.460]   with our
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.500]   renaissance
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.600]   the whole
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.240]   firm almost
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.000]   is PhDs
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.740]   I'm exaggerating
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.120]   two thirds
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:40.460]   of the firm
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.120]   are PhDs
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:41.280]   and they're
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.560]   not just
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.140]   PhDs
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.400]   they're people
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:42.920]   that led
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.960]   math departments
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.540]   of Stanford
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.420]   but aren't all
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.000]   the hedge funds
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.740]   and large
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.420]   wall street firms
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:47.960]   competing for
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.540]   the same people
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.080]   they don't even
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:49.480]   think they're
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.100]   competing with
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.740]   Goldman Sachs
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.920]   and D.E. Shaw
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.320]   renaissance
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:52.980]   sees themselves
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.520]   competing with
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.600]   more Google
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.560]   and such
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.420]   the tech companies
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.940]   meta etc
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.820]   so there are
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:35:59.120]   a lot of
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.400]   little advantages
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.020]   they have
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:01.720]   that add up
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.280]   to a big
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.340]   competitive advantage
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.040]   and how much
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.440]   is the firm
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.280]   currently managing
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.260]   it's a good
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:07.720]   question
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   the medallion
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.060]   fund
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.560]   which is that
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.420]   key fund
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.240]   they cap it
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:11.780]   so that's another
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.300]   advantage
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.060]   they could be
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.860]   much much bigger
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.800]   and one of the
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.840]   biggest mistakes
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.700]   that I've seen
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.400]   over and over
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.180]   in my career
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.140]   is how a firm
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.660]   has success
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.680]   and grows
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.540]   and grows too big
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:24.960]   I mean I read
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.980]   about John Paulson
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.980]   and he had the
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.240]   subprime trade
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.260]   made $20 billion
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.340]   over two years
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.080]   in 2007
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.960]   and 2008
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.000]   and then
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.900]   the hedge fund
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.780]   started growing
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.340]   and got to
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.020]   maybe $30
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.280]   $40 billion
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.540]   and you can see
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.300]   why that happens
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.540]   you only have
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.120]   yes men
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:42.700]   or yes women
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.420]   around you
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.020]   you have people
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.820]   saying how brilliant
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.440]   you are
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.480]   you figure it out
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.160]   something big
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:47.840]   so you figure out
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.780]   you figure you can do
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.580]   other kind of investing
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.980]   and you hire talent
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.620]   and you've got the money
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.760]   people throwing money
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.140]   at you
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.240]   it's hard not to
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.560]   accept those
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.360]   checks in the mail
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.740]   but Jim Simons
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.220]   didn't
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:36:59.720]   he said no
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.060]   we're going to
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.720]   cap this thing
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   and the Medallion fund
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.600]   did grow over time
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.140]   $10 billion
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.760]   $15 billion
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.260]   I think it's about
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.100]   $15 billion today
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.720]   I got a check
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.380]   they have other funds
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.200]   that are open
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:09.760]   to the public
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.840]   or to institutions
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.960]   and are bigger
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.920]   they're a good
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.820]   $20-$30 billion
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.440]   each
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.760]   they don't do as well
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.380]   though and it's not
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.160]   quite the emphasis
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.760]   of the firm
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.820]   down and still
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.360]   the engine
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.100]   that runs that firm
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.740]   I had a question
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.440]   about the book
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.320]   and the history
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.980]   of all this
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.740]   because Jim Simons
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.120]   talked about
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.100]   making a lot of money
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.560]   in the currency markets
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.120]   and the commodity markets
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.620]   but he was having
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.520]   a really difficult time
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.600]   in the equity market
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.900]   and the big breakthrough
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:40.420]   for them
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.360]   was when they figured out
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.180]   how to make money
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:42.920]   in equity
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.640]   so you could talk
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.900]   about that era
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.200]   of renaissance
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.120]   yeah sure
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.020]   so in the early 90s
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.920]   Jim Simons
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.920]   was a wealthy man
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.340]   the firm
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:51.700]   was doing
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.800]   quite well
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.440]   they were
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.520]   as you suggest
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.340]   making a lot of money
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.560]   with fixed income
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.400]   currencies
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.260]   commodities
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.440]   they could not
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.400]   figure out equities
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.520]   a lot of it was
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.400]   they would come up
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.140]   with the signals
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.580]   as they call them
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.340]   the algorithms
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.560]   that should
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.320]   and paper
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.180]   have made money
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:08.680]   for them
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.300]   and yet
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.680]   when they tried
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.220]   to do it
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.600]   in real life
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.820]   it didn't work
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.300]   theoretically
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.280]   it was working
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.780]   some of it was
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.720]   they were impacting
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.420]   prices themselves
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.320]   so
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.040]   they would get
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.560]   all excited
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.340]   their systems
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.200]   would get excited
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.480]   about buying something
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.200]   and selling something
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:25.960]   or buying a group
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.400]   of stocks
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.320]   and selling another group
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.020]   and then by the time
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:28.980]   they would put
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.880]   the trade on
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.920]   they would push
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.660]   the prices around
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.180]   such that
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:32.760]   they didn't make
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.280]   much money
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:33.760]   and they couldn't
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.620]   figure it out
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.280]   and frankly
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.160]   it wasn't even Jim
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:37.760]   and you know
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.440]   people have criticized
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:38.980]   my book
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.340]   and they're like
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:39.840]   well Greg
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.840]   Jim is only
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.640]   half the book
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.460]   and you said
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:42.920]   it's the man
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.540]   who sold the market
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:43.960]   it should be
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.540]   the man
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.160]   who sold the market
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.140]   and you know
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.820]   point well taken
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.340]   there were others
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.140]   that he hired
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.720]   that were responsible
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.480]   for the breakthroughs
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.380]   and in particular
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.480]   a few people
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.440]   from IBM
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.720]   and their speech
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.940]   recognition unit
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.440]   Bob Mercer
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.260]   Peter Brown
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.020]   who currently runs
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.440]   the firm
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:00.900]   a guy named
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.560]   David Magerman
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.680]   and a few others
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.320]   and they were
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:03.940]   brilliant in their
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.360]   own right
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.380]   and Jim said
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.060]   hey go try to
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.020]   help us figure out
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:07.360]   equities
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.040]   because we can't
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.460]   do it
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.480]   and to their credit
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.980]   they did
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.480]   and there's some
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.160]   good fortune
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:11.980]   there as well
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.880]   if you recall
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.380]   from the book
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.100]   or people will
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:14.580]   read the book
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.560]   there was one day
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.160]   where this guy
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.700]   younger software
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.320]   programmer
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.260]   David Magerman
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.700]   computer programmer
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.760]   came to his boss
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.400]   Bob Mercer
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.380]   and said
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.120]   hey boss
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.800]   this number
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.620]   I think
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.700]   it's not updating
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.440]   it's a static
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:29.880]   number
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.380]   and it should be
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:31.740]   updating
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.100]   it was like
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:32.880]   an S&P 500
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.280]   number
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.100]   that for some
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.120]   reason was stuck
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:35.880]   and didn't get
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.220]   updated
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:36.900]   and Mercer
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.360]   to his credit
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:37.860]   said oh
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.760]   you're right
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.300]   I made a mistake
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:40.580]   there
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.100]   and that changed
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.000]   history frankly
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.460]   they started
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:43.900]   figuring out
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.300]   equities
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.360]   so there was
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.000]   some good fortune
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.820]   maybe they want
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.360]   to figure it out
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.140]   anyway eventually
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.080]   or maybe not
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.020]   so you need
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:50.820]   some good fortune
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.200]   too
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.320]   and you need
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:52.740]   a lot of
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.000]   people looking
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.520]   at your work
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:54.860]   and you need
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.500]   people to
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:55.780]   you know
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.200]   you'd be able
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:56.440]   to take
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:56.880]   constructive
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.420]   criticism
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.340]   you know
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.080]   work as a team
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.340]   I want to go
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:00.940]   into a little
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.340]   bit different
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:01.960]   aspect
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.740]   of trading
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.700]   and I know
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.920]   you talked about it
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.520]   you mentioned it
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:06.860]   in the book
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.220]   but you didn't
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.980]   get into it
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.640]   but I want to
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.700]   look at the
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.260]   difference here
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.340]   between this

[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.220]   the type

[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.340]   Lewis wrote
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:20.780]   about in

[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.060]   can you talk
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.400]   a little bit
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.480]   about high
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.260]   frequency trading
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:24.680]   and how it
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.580]   differs from
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.680]   algorithmic
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.020]   trading
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.100]   with high

[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:28.860]   trading
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.300]   the emphasis
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.140]   is on speed
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.600]   and being
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.160]   the first
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.520]   they have
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.860]   better technology
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.220]   than most
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.040]   everybody else
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.100]   they try to be
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:38.600]   quicker and
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:38.920]   faster
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.780]   and try to
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.620]   just get in
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.400]   front of
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:42.960]   investors
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.640]   or rival
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.120]   traders
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.100]   even by
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.700]   milliseconds
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:47.900]   with medium
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.820]   frequency trading
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.340]   which is what
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.060]   Jim Simons
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.600]   and Renaissance
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.200]   what they do
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.040]   they don't
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.400]   emphasize speed
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.120]   they're self
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.620]   deprecating
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.100]   when it comes
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:57.700]   to their own
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.620]   technology
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.400]   it's impressive
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.360]   stuff over there
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.000]   but it doesn't
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.800]   really match up
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.360]   with some of
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:02.860]   the technology
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:03.500]   of others
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.580]   they also
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.740]   don't have
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.220]   the same
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.100]   holding periods
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:07.780]   as the others
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.460]   so high frequency
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:08.880]   trading
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.220]   you're in
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:09.700]   and you're out
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.360]   in milliseconds
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.200]   whereas
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.300]   renaissance
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.180]   it's
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.600]   moments to
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:14.980]   months
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.300]   is what
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:15.820]   they say
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:16.760]   or seconds
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.500]   to seasons
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.260]   generally
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:18.920]   the holding
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.340]   period
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.140]   is a day
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:20.640]   or two
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.740]   kind of thing
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.140]   you know
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:22.420]   it's still
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.460]   quite fast
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.120]   you can call
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.520]   that high
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:24.860]   frequency
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.380]   I suppose
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:25.860]   but that's
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.040]   not really
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.640]   what we on
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.020]   Wall Street
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.040]   describe as
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:29.660]   high frequency
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.240]   it's considered
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.560]   medium frequency
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.480]   a holding period
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.360]   that can be
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.160]   a day or so
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.440]   is not
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:35.980]   considered
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.380]   very fast
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:37.820]   or high
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.060]   so it's a
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:39.580]   different kind
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:39.980]   of investing
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.760]   and frankly
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.300]   that's one of
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:41.820]   their advantages
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.120]   too
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:42.560]   there are a lot
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:42.880]   of people
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.660]   doing high
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:44.180]   frequency
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.180]   there aren't
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:45.820]   as many
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.200]   doing medium
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:47.900]   frequency
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:48.440]   there's
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.060]   two sigma
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:49.800]   there are a few
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.300]   others
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:51.500]   but renaissance
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.220]   is a little
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:52.620]   bit unique
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.180]   in that regard
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:53.560]   so again
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.040]   the emphasis
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:54.740]   is on
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.780]   buying stuff
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:56.040]   that's going
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:56.540]   to go up
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.140]   and selling
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:57.480]   stuff that's
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:57.780]   going to go
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.360]   down
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.160]   as opposed
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.600]   to just
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.200]   being in
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.480]   getting
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.280]   stepping in
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.060]   front of
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:02.620]   rivals
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.660]   by a millisecond
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.480]   and one
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:04.780]   one of the
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.380]   points
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:05.780]   of the book
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:05.980]   what I
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.120]   found
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:06.660]   fascinating
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.760]   is that
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.660]   their win
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.380]   percentage
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.800]   was expected
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.400]   to be
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.300]   about
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.680]   50.75%
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.620]   so not
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.680]   even 51%
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.560]   of the time
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.680]   they expected
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.100]   to win
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.000]   to have a
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:21.420]   profit
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.540]   but they
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.420]   would put
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.300]   in hundreds
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.300]   of thousands
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.200]   of trades
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:26.920]   so they
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920]   would take
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.700]   that very
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:29.660]   very small
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.400]   percentage
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.280]   advantage
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:31.900]   that they
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.320]   felt that
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:32.860]   they had
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.000]   and they
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:34.460]   would just
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.500]   magnify it
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.120]   with sheer
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.800]   number of
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.300]   trades
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:37.920]   yeah you
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.520]   could think
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.160]   of
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:39.840]   renaissance
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.380]   you can
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:40.940]   liken them
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.500]   to a
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.100]   casino
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.020]   a las vegas
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:43.480]   casino
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.120]   which
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.440]   doesn't win
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.420]   on every
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.240]   trade
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:47.960]   as every
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.380]   roll
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.400]   every bet
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.780]   but wins
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.120]   on majority
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:52.580]   of them
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.160]   just a bare
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:53.560]   majority
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.220]   sometimes
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:54.760]   that's how
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.120]   renaissance
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.960]   looked at
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.180]   it
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.240]   some people
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.600]   come away
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:57.980]   from the
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.160]   book
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:58.580]   thinking
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.120]   ah the
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:42:59.420]   market
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.060]   must be
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:00.620]   inefficient
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.420]   because
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:01.900]   renaissance
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.540]   makes so
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.320]   much money
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.200]   and I
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:04.720]   would argue
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.080]   that if
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.480]   anything
