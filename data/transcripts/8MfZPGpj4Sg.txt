[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   So these ultra-processed foods have a number of features that make them, make people prone
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.800]   to gain weight.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.160]   And there's really beautiful work, I don't know if you know this, from Kevin Hall at
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.840]   the NIH who's investigated this.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.680]   He's really, in my opinion, the best person doing this kind of human obesity research
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.680]   today.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.680]   And he does these experiments where he takes people into the NIH, into the hospital, hospitalizes
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.200]   them for several weeks so he can exactly control what they eat.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.480]   And he did this beautiful experiment where basically he had chefs prepare two kinds of
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.760]   food, one ultra-processed and the other not ultra-processed, sort of more whole foods,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.760]   more healthier foods, but had them take a lot of care so that when they gave the foods
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.240]   to independent raters, to people to test, they would say, "This is about equally palatable."
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   So I like this ultra-processed dish as much as this non-ultra-processed dish.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.040]   What's an example of an ultra-processed dish, like an out-of-package macaroni and cheese?
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.040]   Exactly, that kind of stuff.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   With bacon kind of thing?
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.040]   Exactly.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.440]   Versus some pasta sitting next to a vegetable and a nice piece of...
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.440]   Salmon or something.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.440]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.440]   Okay.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.760]   And took people into the hospital, basically allowed them to eat just as much as they would
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.040]   like first of the ultra-processed meals.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.920]   So they had the selection of ultra-processed meals for a couple of weeks, and then switched
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.480]   them to the non-ultra-processed meals, and then also did it in the reverse order.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.600]   So the other half of the people, they got the regular food first, then they got the
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600]   ultra-processed food.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.760]   And what he found is that even though people rated the foods as equally palatable, they
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.680]   ate much more of the ultra-processed food.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.120]   And they actually gained weight during that two-week period when they were being given
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.120]   the ultra-processed foods.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.160]   And then when you switched them, they lost weight.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.000]   So the idea being that you can have two sets of food that you have equal preferences for,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.160]   but something about the ultra-processed food is making you eat more of it when you actually
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   consume it.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.120]   And there's a number of ideas about why that could be.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.800]   So one idea is that these ultra-processed foods have been optimized to have the right
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.280]   percentage of fat and sugar and protein to sort of promote more consumption once you
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.280]   start eating it.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.600]   So that could be part of it.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.400]   Another idea is that, you know, a big thing about whole foods is that they take more energy
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.040]   to digest and they have more volume.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.560]   So one of the striking things from that study is if you just look at the pictures of the
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.880]   meals, they're the same number of calories, but there's so much more food, seemingly,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.040]   on the non-processed food versus the ultra-processed food.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.720]   And that's just because whole foods are bigger, because they're not so energy dense.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.440]   And we know that, for example, volume is a major signal in the short term for regulating
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440]   food intake.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.560]   So if you just eat more volume, that could be valuable.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   And there's lots of things like that.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.120]   So I think that's another plausible hypothesis, but the truth is we don't really know.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.240]   - I have a hypothesis and I don't want to force you into speculation, but given that
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.800]   you've studied and discovered that the neurons and circuits involved in appetitive and consummatory
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.920]   behaviors can learn based on experience and expectation, I think it's fair game to at
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.680]   least ask your thoughts on this.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.960]   So I've been paying a lot of attention to the landscape of what the general public think
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.780]   about, let's call them elimination diets, where people will just eat meat, or will go
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.000]   onto a vegan diet, or do some time-restricted feeding, or do any number of different things
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.140]   that have been shown to promote weight loss, provided people obey the laws of thermodynamics
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.160]   and consume fewer calories than they burn.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.540]   I do believe in calories in, calories out, and there are a number of different routes
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.560]   to get there, and some are more painful, some are less painful, and it depends on the individual
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.320]   lifestyle exercise and on and on.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.000]   But let's just suppose for a moment, based on Kevin's work on highly processed foods
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   versus whole foods, that there's a learning that takes place when we eat, and that this
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.600]   learning takes place over time, such that our brain and appetite start to link the variables
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.920]   of taste, macronutrients, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, so knowledge about macronutrients,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.480]   a piece of fish is mostly protein, has some fat, a bowl of rice is mostly carbohydrate,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.520]   has some protein, put a pat of butter on it, has some fat also, it's sort of obvious.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:19.540]   But taste, macronutrient content, calories, which we already know people with anorexia
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.380]   are exquisitely good at counting with their eyes.
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.080]   So it's possible they represent, again, a pathologic extreme of this.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.560]   And micronutrient content, maybe even amino acid content, like how much leucine is there.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.640]   Now, most people aren't thinking about how much leucine is in a meal, but we know that
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.280]   leucine is important for certain aspects of muscle metabolism.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.840]   It's present in certain proteins and not others.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.600]   You're going to find less of it in a vegetable, typically, than you would in a piece of chicken
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.960]   and so on.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.160]   And that when people eat mostly non-processed or minimally processed foods and not in combination,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.480]   so we're not talking about stewing all this together or blending all of it together, which
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   sounds disgusting, right?
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.360]   Broccoli, rice, and a chicken breast blend together, it just sounds horrible, but eating
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.240]   them separately, if there's some olive oil and a little pat of butter involved, like
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.940]   that sounds pretty good.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:19.140]   But a highly processed food in some ways is a blending together of macronutrients, micronutrients,
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.180]   if there are any, and other features of the food that neurons in the brain seem to pay
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.420]   attention to, and then giving it a unified taste, a Dorito, right?
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.780]   A candy bar that we attach to the product, we attach to the name of the processed food,
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.400]   to the packaging.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.740]   But I could imagine, and here's the hypothesis, that that is "confusing" to our neural circuits
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.620]   in a way that doesn't match up well with our thermodynamic requirements of how much we're
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.780]   burning versus how much we need to eat.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.100]   Whereas when I eat a piece of steak and a vegetable, I actually want less carbohydrate
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.100]   afterwards.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.940]   If I eat the carbohydrate first, for me, it's difficult because I love the taste of carbohydrates,
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.540]   especially when they're combined with fat.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.220]   But there seems to be an easier time regulating food intake when people step back and say,
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.060]   "I'm going to consume minimally processed whole foods."
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.660]   And I'm guessing it's not just because they're trying to be healthier, that might be what
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.900]   stimulates the shift, but that the brain starts to learn the relationship between food volume,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.980]   smell, taste, what these things look like, and satiation at the level of, "Oh, that's
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.300]   enough amino acids because I had a piece of fish, so maybe I don't need to consume as
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.340]   much of some other things."
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.580]   Or the vegetables provide volume and fiber, and often vegetables can taste really delicious
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.580]   too.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:48.100]   So that there's a linking of nutrients, calories, and taste in a way that's more appropriately
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.980]   matched to the energetic demands of the organism, in this case, us humans, that highly processed
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.220]   foods bypass.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:02.340]   Now, I realize that was long-winded and forgive me, but my audience is used to that.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.180]   Whenever I'm trying to table something for, no pun intended, for discussion that I would
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.660]   like to think can at least stimulate some additional thinking about a landscape, in
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.860]   this case, nutrition and feeding behavior, that for a lot of people is just really confusing.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.860]   And here's why.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.860]   And this is the last thing I'll say.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.940]   I have several friends who have been very overweight their entire lives, for whom the
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.460]   following diet has worked exceptionally well.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.460]   I'm not a diet coach.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.460]   I'm not a nutritionist.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.020]   I don't pretend to be one.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:39.860]   I say eat proteins like meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, and fruit, and do that for a couple
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:45.340]   of months, and then add back in starches as you see fit based on your food intake.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.300]   And without fail, they all lose a ton of weight.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.060]   They're very happy with that.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:56.660]   They add back in a minimum of starches, they keep the weight off, and they're also exercising,
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.360]   but not more than they were before in most cases.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.860]   And I don't think that it's meat or fish or vegetables per se.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.540]   I think it's that they finally develop an appreciation for what different foods have
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.400]   in terms of what they actually need.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   And without fail, they all say, "Oh, you know, I went to this party and I had a piece
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.480]   of cake and it didn't taste good to me after three or four bites."
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.820]   So that's interesting too.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.240]   So I just would like your thoughts on this.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.600]   We're not defining any new diets.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.880]   I don't sell any diets.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.100]   I don't do any of that.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.260]   But I find it amazing that when people start eating minimally processed whole foods, I
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.480]   have to assume that their brain changes as it relates to appetite, craving, and just
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.140]   kind of an unconscious understanding about what food is providing them or not.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.860]   And that highly processed foods basically bypass all of this and just get you to consume
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.600]   more, perhaps in hopes of getting something that you probably aren't getting at all or
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.500]   that you need to consume a lot of this food in order to get.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.100]   There are several interesting ideas there.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.380]   So there's two that come to mind just thinking about what you just said.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.940]   So the one is the idea of what's going on when these people consume simpler diets, more
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.620]   of whole foods.
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:10.540]   And one thing I think that's very likely going on is this phenomenon of sensory-specific
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.380]   satiety as being engaged.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.980]   And so sensory-specific satiety is just the idea that as you expose yourself repeatedly
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.240]   to a certain flavor or taste, you basically lose appetite for that.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.340]   You get specific loss of appetite for that flavor or taste.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.740]   This is why, as you said, basically if you start off eating the protein, after a while
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.540]   you're like, "I don't want any more salmon, but I would like some carbohydrates now,"
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.060]   because you have this sensory-specific satiety.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.620]   And so it's well known, actually, that if you simplify your diet, make your diet really
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.840]   simple, so there's just a few things, the sensory-specific satiety alone can cause you
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.860]   to eat less, basically, because there's just less variety in your diet and you don't want
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.240]   to eat more of that same thing.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.740]   And so I think a lot of diets, actually, it's not about the specific macronutrient or the
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.060]   specific food, it's just that they're reducing the variety in the diet.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.980]   Eventually you just get sick of eating the same thing.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.100]   And the thought behind that idea is that it's important evolutionarily so that you eat a
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.100]   diverse diet.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.100]   It's the reason, probably, that you want sweets after you've eaten a savory meal and so on.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.620]   A second idea, though, that comes to mind is just, as you mentioned, this idea of learning.
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:20.740]   And so much about our preferences for food, they're not innate, they're driven by learning.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.500]   And so there are some things that are innate.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.740]   So if you put sugar on a baby's tongue, it'll smile, indicating that it likes it.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.340]   And if you put something bitter, it'll frown.
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.420]   And a rat will do the same thing, a neonate rat.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:39.540]   But most of flavor and the perception of food is not just sweet or bitter, it's this much
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:44.660]   more complex sensation that involves smells, it involves taste, and then it involves how
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.660]   those tastes and smells interact with the post-ingestive effects of the nutrients.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.100]   So the sensing of those nutrients in your stomach and in your intestine, primarily in
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.340]   your intestine, are thought to then feed back and then change your preference for these
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.340]   foods.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.440]   And so there's lots of examples of this that you can just imagine from everyday experience.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.420]   Most people, the first time they had a beer or the first time they had a glass of coffee,
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.700]   found it repulsive, right?
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.340]   Because it's extremely bitter.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.460]   But then we come to crave these things because we know what they do to our body, we like
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.460]   what they do to our body.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.140]   And that doesn't just make us take them like they're medicine, we actually somehow change
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.060]   our very perception of how that flavor is.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.100]   We actually come to savor that flavor we previously found disgusting.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.820]   And it's because our sensation of whether something's good or bad depends on our internal
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.820]   state.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.580]   And so it's an interesting idea, perhaps if these ultra-processed foods that have so many
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.660]   different ingredients and such an unnatural combination, perhaps this process of learning
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:42.620]   about the nutrient content of different foods and flavors becomes impaired because it's
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.780]   just the brain is not used, the brain's used to saying, this is a piece of chicken and
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.340]   this is primarily protein.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.700]   And so I can gauge from this flavor, I can connect this flavor to an amino acid content,
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.400]   but something that's so diverse, it might be harder to do.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:01.580]   - And isn't it the case that the neurons in the gut and the hormones that are produced
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:07.060]   by the gut as we digest food, and that the neurons in the brain that control appetite
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:15.220]   and feeding have to be tuned to macronutrient content, because those are the primary colors
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:22.060]   of nutrients and nutrients are the way in which we can persist on a day-to-day basis,
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.060]   right?
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.260]   I mean, I'm not trying to sound more sophisticated where simpler terms would suffice.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.460]   What I'm basically saying is that the neurons in our brains that control these behaviors,
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:37.740]   both eating and cessation of eating an ingredient or an entire meal, can't be tuned to a particular
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:46.220]   food product or to chicken or to an egg or to a steak or to lentils, but rather to amino
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.620]   acid content, essential amino acid content in particular, essential fatty acids.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.140]   And in the case of carbohydrate, whatever is going to replace whatever glycogen we might
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.140]   have depleted, right?
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.580]   I mean, like if we really break it down into biology, eating is for a purpose.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:05.540]   And my understanding is that the purpose of eating is to replace those things as needed
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:11.660]   rather than to, you know, taste savory or taste, you know-
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.660]   Absolutely.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.660]   Absolutely.
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.660]   Absolutely.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.060]   Those are just, those sensory cues are just markers that tell the brain what might be
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.060]   in that substance.
