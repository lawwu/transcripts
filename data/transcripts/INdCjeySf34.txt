[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:13.680]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound Show.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.820]   This is our last show of the year.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.720]   Duncan wore a Dundon Miffler sweater for us.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.000]   Remember our email here, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.040]   We love all the emails.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.680]   Personal emails, personal responses, as Michael says.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.280]   Today's show is sponsored by our friends at Bird Dog.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.440]   I just had a comment from a friend today saying,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.840]   Ben, thank you, I bought one of the Bird Dog polos.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.960]   It's amazing, the material.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840]   They like it, they said I'm gonna have to get another one.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.040]   I think it's too late to buy Bird Dogs
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.560]   for people for Christmas.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.520]   Unless you wanna give something late,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.140]   but you can still get a gift card.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.240]   I actually ordered from Bird Dogs a pair,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.060]   remember I found those new pairs of shorts, new colors.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.080]   I bought two pairs of shorts
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.880]   and they gave me a free t-shirt.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.880]   A little pocket tee, it was nice.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.080]   And we're still giving away the free hats.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.600]   Duncan wants one of these so bad.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.720]   The dad tag hat. One day, one day.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   Birddogs.com/ATC or enter the code promo code ATC
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.120]   when you check out.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.540]   Remember they have shorts, polos, khakis, joggers.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.480]   I've been wearing the joggers a lot lately.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.000]   Very comfy, very stretchy.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.400]   I don't think it's too late either.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.960]   You get it and you just tell your family,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.800]   hey, supply chain issues.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.640]   That's true.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.600]   You'll get 'em sometime soon.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.560]   That's fair.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.040]   Before we get into the show,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.280]   we wanna shout out one of our loyal viewers, listeners,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.000]   Dave at Brewery424, my favorite brewery in Holland, Michigan.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600]   We're at the college.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.960]   Big listener, huge contributor
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.060]   to the Animal Spirits Discord over the years.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.320]   Dave has actually sent us some gear and some beer before.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.440]   Every holiday season,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.480]   Dave actually organizes a charity raffle.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.240]   I guess he's given over like $30,000 to various charities.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.040]   We're gonna partner with Dave this year to help him out.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.280]   So make a donation to No Kid Hungry,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280]   save your receipt, send it to Dave
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.320]   at thecompoundcharity@gmail.com.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.000]   That's thecompoundcharity@gmail.com.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   And he'll give you one entry into this raffle
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.100]   for every $20 you donate.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.120]   Very cool.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.360]   And the prize is a package from him
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.960]   and it's gonna have some stuff from the compound.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.040]   Yeah, so he's gonna pick two winners
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.640]   and he's gonna send a brewery prize pack,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   which I think could be some clothes,
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.680]   maybe a case of beer, something like that from 424.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.920]   And then we're also going to send some free compound gear
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.840]   from idontshop.com.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.080]   So it's thecompoundcharity@gmail.com with your receipt.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.560]   That email is not affiliated with us at all,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.040]   so don't try to get ahold of our team that way,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.040]   but that's going to Dave and who's a good guy.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   So we're just trying to spread the good word
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.120]   here on the holidays.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.180]   Yeah, just to reiterate,
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.800]   no one will check that email after this.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.100]   So just forget it after you send your receipt.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.240]   But 'tis the season, if you are doing well,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.220]   and a lot of the people who listen to our show are.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.060]   Not to brag.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.040]   If you're able to give back, try to do so.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.600]   Yeah, No Kid Hungry, we've supported them a lot in the past.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.000]   So yeah, great charity
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.480]   and looking forward to being able to support them some more.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.940]   424 is great beer.
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.780]   It's true.
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.600]   I enjoy it.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.800]   Even for a guy who doesn't like IPAs, I like the beer.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.840]   I've liked everything that Dave's sent me.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.520]   He even sent me one that was like,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.200]   it felt like it was a prank.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.520]   It was like 11% alcohol or something, or 10%.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   It was like really strong.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.720]   Still liked it.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   He didn't get me.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.560]   Put you down for the night.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.380]   All right.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.320]   Let's do some questions.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.160]   Okay.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.520]   Up first today, we have a question from Mark.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.320]   My portfolio is still below its highs
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.200]   due to the sell-off in bonds.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.000]   Could you do a piece on how far we are
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   below the bond market peak?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.840]   All right.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.200]   This was a response to, I wrote last week,
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.240]   the stock market had round-tripped.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.680]   It was almost two years.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.280]   We had to, in the S&P, we were down 25%.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.940]   The NASDAQ I think was down 34% in the 2022 bear market.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.240]   Back to break even with dividends reinvested, pretty good.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.280]   So the question is, what about bonds?
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.180]   And bonds had a bear market of their own in a lot of cases.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.080]   You can't really say you've made your money
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.020]   back in bonds yet.
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.880]   So the thing is, there's really no Dow or S&P
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.760]   when it comes to the bonds.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.680]   So I guess the best proxy
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.040]   is something like the Barclays aggregate,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.160]   which is, you could look at total bond market.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.400]   The next one, so John, throw up the chart here.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.500]   I got a ton of charts.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.700]   The AG, and this is total returns with income reinvested
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.640]   and yields with bonds,
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.720]   'cause you can't just look at prices on bonds.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.740]   It was down nearly 19% of the lows.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.000]   Now we've shot back up.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.560]   And these numbers are through
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.520]   the close of the day on Wednesday.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.920]   It shot back up a lot lately as rates have fallen.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.040]   So we're still 10% down.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.820]   So we're still in a correction there.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.660]   Do the next one, John.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.480]   30-year treasuries.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.440]   TLT, 20 to 30-year treasuries.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.760]   At the lows, it was down nearly 50%.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.440]   It's still down 37%.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.400]   So you've seen a nice snapback rally.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.480]   Rates have fallen.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.320]   If you've been holding on for the past three or four years,
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.600]   you're still down a lot.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.640]   Next one, IEF.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.520]   This is seven to 10-year treasuries.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.240]   At the lows, we were down 24%.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.960]   We're now down a little less than 17%.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.200]   Still pretty good ding for 10-year treasuries.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.340]   Last year was the worst year
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.280]   for 10-year treasuries on history.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.240]   Next one, three to seven-year treasuries, IEI.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.520]   This is down 9%.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.840]   It was down 15% or so.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.400]   At the lows, not too bad.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.840]   So that's mostly treasuries.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.480]   Barclays AG also has some mortgage bonds.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.680]   Let's look at corporate bonds.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.920]   LQD.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.640]   This is the biggest ETF for corporate bonds.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.780]   It was down 25% at the lows, now down 12%.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.800]   Finally, high-yield bonds.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.180]   This one is kind of crazy.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.000]   High-yield bonds were only down 17% at the lows,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.480]   now down a little less than 2%.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.320]   Now, this seems weird
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.800]   because how could high-yield outperform
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.920]   these other bond areas because it's more risk?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.040]   Well, high-yield acts more like equities than bonds.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.080]   And so that's one of the reasons
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.680]   that we saw high-yield not go down as much
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.120]   and then also rally a lot more.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.460]   You didn't really have spreads blow out.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.360]   So something like high-yield
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.440]   actually is outperforming the bond bear market,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.680]   which seems crazy to think about
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.260]   because usually if there's a bear market,
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.960]   high-yield is gonna get crushed.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.480]   In 2008, it was down 40% or 50%.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.960]   Knowing what you know about my risk tolerance,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.520]   which bond fund do you think I have the most of
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.600]   in my portfolio?
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.560]   You just hold a single Oatly corporate bond
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.400]   and it's trading for 12 cents on the dollar.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.600]   I probably would, but no, it's junk bonds, you know?
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.880]   Okay, so you're doing pretty well.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.200]   And if you're in T-bills,
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.440]   obviously you didn't have to worry about losses.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.200]   If you're in short-term treasuries,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.080]   one to three year or something like that,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.040]   you really didn't have to worry about losses.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.440]   And so it really depends.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.560]   How you feel about bonds depends on where you are.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.080]   And if you're in zero-coupon bonds,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.360]   which is, Duncan, that should be you, zero-coupon bonds,
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.440]   that we're talking 50 to 60% losses
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.800]   and they've shot back up, it's still down a lot.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.360]   - I like to give those a look.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.800]   - But yeah, the total bond market's
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.880]   still technically in correction territory.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.000]   So you've got some work to do.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.800]   And that's gonna be made up by rates
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   would have to fall a lot more
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.000]   to get out of correction territory
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.560]   or the yields are higher now,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.120]   so you're gonna make it up over the course of,
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.440]   you're just gonna have to wait.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.680]   But it's coming, we're getting there.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.120]   Stocks round trip before bonds.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.080]   - You have hope.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.680]   - Next question.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.960]   - Okay, Travis writes in,
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.000]   "I'm a big fan of the show
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.360]   "and have been listening for the last two years.

[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.800]   "I regularly hear how you and Michael
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.760]   "are 100% in stocks because you guys
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.040]   "are still relatively young.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   "Middle age is still young, right?"
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.720]   - Shot's fired.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.800]   - "Hearing you guys say this inspired me
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.040]   "to sell the bond portion of my portfolio,

[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.280]   "but 70% of my portfolio is invested in the S&P 500.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.120]   "So my current portfolio is 70% S&P,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.940]   "20% international stocks, and 10% triple Q.

[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.820]   "Is investing in the Q's and the S&P 500 redundant?

[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.400]   "but the NASDAQ gives me more exposure to tech,

[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.920]   "Companies."
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.280]   - So let's play a new round of Ben's favorite game,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.660]   Am I Diversified?
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.160]   - Am I Diversified?
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.520]   - So 70% in the S&P, 20% international, 10% NASDAQ.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.280]   You're diversified, kind of.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.840]   Like if we're doing a one to 10 here,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.640]   you're at a six maybe.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.840]   You have a heady concentration of growth stocks.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.080]   And the question is, are you comfortable with that?
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.040]   I actually wrote a piece this week
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.360]   called A Short History of NASDAQ 100 Returns.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.880]   John, throw the table up here for me
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.160]   that shows the NASDAQ, S&P, and Russell.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.280]   And I looked at these different time frames.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.480]   The NASDAQ 100 goes back to late 1985.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.840]   So 1986 is the first year.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.760]   I looked at these different periods, 1986 to 1990.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.440]   And then you had this huge run up in 1991 to 1999.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.200]   The NASDAQ 100 was up 38% per year,
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.640]   up over 1,700% in total, as the S&P was up 440%.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.760]   And I compared the small caps here too.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.960]   Then you had this period from 2000 to 2011.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.720]   So we're looking at a 12 year period
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.840]   where in total the NASDAQ 100 was down 36%.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.220]   S&P was up 7% over that period.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.160]   And the Russell 2000 small caps was actually up over 70%.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.440]   And then you have the cycle from 2012 to 2023
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.800]   where the NASDAQ's up 19% per year,
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.480]   totally outdoes the S&P 500.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.800]   So the way I like to think about it is,
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.920]   and by the way, these start and end dates are cherry picked.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.360]   I did this for a reason,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.440]   but I think it's helpful for a question like this.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.360]   The NASDAQ 100 is the S&P on steroids.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.240]   It's higher highs and lower lows.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.000]   Both indexes are concentrated
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.520]   more in large cap growth stocks,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.380]   but the NASDAQ is so on a much bigger scale.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.420]   So the S&P 500, the top 10 stocks make up 30% of the total.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.980]   For the NASDAQ 100, it's more like 50%.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.080]   So a lot more concentration,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.100]   a lot more bang for your buck.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.380]   The losses are gonna be bigger.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.200]   The gains tend to be bigger as well.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.800]   The question is, can you stick with a strategy
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.460]   of investing in large cap growth stocks?
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.780]   I think it's probably gonna be an okay strategy
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.540]   over the longterm, but can you deal with the time
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.460]   when that strategy doesn't work?
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.840]   Because looking at the last 10 years or so,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.160]   you'd look back and go, why would I invest in anything else?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.640]   This makes no sense.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.280]   We don't have to go back that far in history
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.120]   to find a period where this strategy didn't outperform.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.120]   John, chart on again, asset class returns, 1999 to 2009.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.680]   So this is from the end of 1999.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.280]   So the first decade of this century,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.200]   NASDAQ 100 in total over this 10-year period was down 48%.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.480]   S&P had a lost decade as well, down about 10%.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.240]   In that same time period, mid-caps were up 85%.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.060]   Small-caps were up 85%.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.680]   International stocks were up almost 20%.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.320]   Emerging markets were up 160%.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   So all of these areas that have underperformed
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.640]   in the last decade or so outperformed the NASDAQ
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.840]   by a lot in the first decade of the century.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.080]   John, throw the next one up.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.680]   This is the following.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.920]   Give me a, John, can you go back and forth a few times?
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.280]   See, that one, there we go.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.520]   Now stick on this one.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.360]   You can see the difference.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.540]   We went worst to first for the NASDAQ 100,
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.060]   and we went first to worst for emerging markets.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.480]   Small-caps and mid-caps actually did okay
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.760]   for both of the first two decades of the century.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.120]   S&P had a strong comeback as well.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.460]   So I think this is a, I love showing this example
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.440]   because it shows, proves the power of diversification
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.240]   as a risk mitigation strategy and not going to extremes.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.000]   Those extremes are really fun
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.360]   when the NASDAQ 100 is up a lot,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.200]   like it has been for the past 12, 13, 14 years.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.040]   But you had that 12 or 13-year period
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.280]   to start out the decade where the NASDAQ got just crushed
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.940]   coming out of the dot-com bubble.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.100]   Obviously, it should be noted diversification isn't perfect.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.220]   When you diversify, you're guaranteed to hold the losers,
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.420]   but you're also guaranteed to hold the winners.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.620]   The point is, it blunts the impact of the losers.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.820]   So you're not just getting crushed.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.260]   So if you can stick with a strategy
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.500]   that's gonna underperform by a lot at certain periods,
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.440]   that's fine.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.620]   I think diversification helps it.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.700]   So when you have those periods of underperformance,
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.580]   you also have something else that lifts it up a little bit
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.420]   and you can rebalance.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.700]   And it's kind of a pick-your-poison kind of thing.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.780]   You could invest in large-cap growth stocks like the S&P
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.980]   and stick with it.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.260]   I'm sure it'd be a pretty decent strategy.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.060]   It has been for the past 100 years or so.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.860]   It's just, can you stick with it
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.140]   when it's going to underperform?
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.980]   And it will at some point.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.220]   I don't know when, but it's going to.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.260]   - And just for the record,
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.700]   when you and Michael talk about being 100% stocks,
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.340]   you're talking about your retirement.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.020]   - Yeah, we're talking about retirement.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.020]   I also have a lot of...
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.860]   I mentioned this from a barbell person.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.620]   I have plenty of liquid cash on hand for other stuff,
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.800]   and that's what allows me
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.700]   to leave that retirement stuff alone.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.980]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.060]   It's 100% of stocks for things like retirement accounts,
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.040]   not stuff that I need to spend on
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.420]   that's going to be in the near intermediate term.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.260]   - Right.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.780]   You have to be crazy to do that, right?
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.780]   - Yeah.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.460]   You're what, 115% in stocks?
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.700]   - Probably.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.980]   - All right.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.820]   - Okay. - Next question.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.940]   - Up next, we have a question from Chris.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.420]   What would you advise as an alternative
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.080]   to getting on the real estate ladder,
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.980]   saving and waiting for lower interest rates
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.060]   or investing in the market
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.580]   until you can put down a larger down payment?
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.420]   - All right.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.240]   Each week, there's a question
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.020]   where I kind of do a deeper dive than usual.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.740]   This is my deep dive one.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.220]   The thing is, offering advice on something like a home
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.300]   is even harder than offering someone advice,
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.620]   personalized advice on your portfolio,
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.940]   because there's so many idiosyncratic risks.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.940]   Where you live,
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.940]   what the local real estate market looks like,
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.140]   the number of houses that are available
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.620]   for sale and the supply,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.540]   like your tastes and preferences for a house,
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.860]   your financial situation, your budget, all these things.
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.220]   So I'm gonna look at this
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.820]   from a perspective of what would I do
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.020]   if I was forced to buy a house right now?
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.360]   I have a career change.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.820]   I have to move, family, whatever the reason is.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.280]   In 2017, when we had my twins,
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.620]   we could have made it work, I guess,
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.420]   but our old house, it wasn't set up for twins.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.180]   We had two bedrooms upstairs and two bedrooms downstairs,
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.380]   and we had an older daughter as well.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.180]   And so the layout of the house just never would have worked.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.760]   For the first month we were there,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.020]   we had the twins in cribs sleeping in my office
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.900]   because it was on the same floor.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.140]   So we had to move, we had to get a bigger house.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.020]   So we were kind of forced to do it, right?
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.860]   That's what happens.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.160]   Okay, housing is so unaffordable right now
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.040]   and no one's ever gonna move again,
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.760]   but people are going to because life gets in the way.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.840]   So I'm looking at it if that was my situation
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.040]   'cause I can't look at it from other people's,
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.440]   this is just me, okay?
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.280]   Activity in the housing sector is down,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.900]   but there's still activity happening.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.940]   So John, throw up existing home sales.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.680]   They've been crashing, but we're at a run rate
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.840]   over the last 12 months of 3.8 million.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.440]   It's the lowest it's been
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.940]   since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis,
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.840]   but there's still housing changing hands.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.260]   Now show new home sales, John.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.180]   It's actually been rising.
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.060]   It fell, but throughout 2023,
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.140]   even with 8% mortgage rates,
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.140]   new single family houses sold rose.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.060]   So now let's do the next one.
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.220]   This shows the breakdown of new versus existing home sales.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.620]   In the existing home sales, obviously dwarf it,
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.540]   but back in the 2000, early 2000s housing bubble,
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.140]   we got to about 15 or 16% of all sales were new homes.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:17.980]   They were building a lot
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.140]   and we actually had oversupplied.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.220]   And that's one of the reasons that housing markets ramped up
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.840]   and then they crashed in 2008.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.060]   It got to the lows 'cause all the builders pulled out
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.380]   and they're like, screw this, we're out of here.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.180]   We're not building any more houses.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.060]   So it got down to 5% of the total by 2010.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.340]   John, throw that chart back up there one more time.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.940]   It's now falling, the existing home sales,
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.780]   so new home sales are rising.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.380]   It's back up to 15 or 16%.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.900]   So there's a lot more new home sales going in
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.380]   than there were for the past decade or so.
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.940]   So how is this the case in a world of higher inflation,
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.020]   meaning higher input costs,
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.260]   now you can do chart off, John,
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.260]   and higher mortgage rates?
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.180]   Because home builders own the land, right?
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.380]   They're not gonna just sit there like a homeowner
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.740]   who has a 3% mortgage locked in
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.020]   and most of those homeowners say, I don't need to move.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.500]   I can wait.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.220]   Home builders are incentivized to sell.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.820]   So surprisingly, costs have gone up.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.440]   Remember when lumber was the biggest thing?
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.140]   Everyone on social media had a picture of people on a date
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.940]   sitting next to lumber at Home Depot
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.620]   and said, take me somewhere expensive, and it was lumber.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.800]   So you had all these costs go up.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.600]   So home builders raised their prices,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.580]   but then, hey, the cost of lumber fell
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.860]   and all these other costs fell,
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.120]   but home builders didn't then lower their prices.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.960]   They took it to margins.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.380]   So I had our research analyst, Sean, look at this.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.600]   John, throw up, this is gross margins.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.780]   At the beginning of the pandemic,
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.380]   for the five biggest publicly traded home builders
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.940]   in the United States and through the latest numbers
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.900]   in Q3 2023, across the board,
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.100]   we've seen a 25% average increase in home builder margins,
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.940]   which sounds crazy.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.540]   Again, in the highest inflation we've had in 40 years,
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.740]   how do they improve their margins?
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.780]   'Cause they raise prices faster than costs went up.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.700]   And when costs went down,
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.060]   they took that to the bottom line, right?
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.180]   So the thing they can do though,
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.380]   because most home builders don't wanna lower prices,
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.940]   'cause if I lock in a price for a new home,
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.460]   and then a month later, some other person comes along
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.660]   and locks in a price that's lower than me,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.900]   I'm gonna say, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop building my house.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.220]   I want that lower price.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.420]   So they're not gonna really lower prices like that.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.940]   What they can do is buy down mortgage rates.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.300]   So I looked on Pulte Homes website this week.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.500]   They say 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 5.75%.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.220]   They just buy down the mortgage rate for you.
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.820]   - Wait, can you explain that?
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.020]   I don't quite understand what you're saying.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.860]   - So anyone could buy a mortgage down.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.260]   You just pay more money up front
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.500]   and you basically buy points, they call it.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.780]   So you pay money up front to have a lower mortgage rate.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.940]   Right? - Interesting.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.180]   - Yeah, instead of paying the interest
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.340]   out over the course of the loan, you pay to lower it.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.260]   Lenar has one that says they have a fixed rate for 4.5%.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.660]   So how is that possible if the mortgage is for 7%?
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.740]   'Cause they're buying it down for you.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.420]   So that's how they make it cheaper.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.220]   So these home builders can incentivize you to build now
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.500]   by offering you lower rates.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.100]   'Cause they, again, they have larger margins
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.460]   so they can afford it.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.940]   So it's pretty good.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.860]   So another benefit to the new home sale thing
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.220]   is that there's been an increase in it
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.020]   and they build more smaller homes.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.420]   So John, throw up my chart from Fred here.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.780]   This is a median sales price for new houses
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.700]   sold in the United States.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.980]   You can see it's crashing.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.660]   And a lot of people were commenting on this
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.900]   on social media a couple of weeks ago
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.460]   saying, how is this possible?
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.460]   The median price of a new home
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.140]   has gone from $500,000 roughly to 409,000.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.620]   How is that possible if housing prices
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.460]   are at all-time highs?
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.020]   Well, it's not because new home prices are crashing.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.540]   It's because we're building smaller homes.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.460]   So the next one, John,
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.300]   this is the median square foot of a new home.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.140]   It's falling.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:32.980]   So this is a good thing.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.100]   Remember for years we talked about
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.460]   how no one was building starter homes anymore?
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.180]   Because new home builders have stepped in
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.580]   to pick up this vacuum
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.660]   where people aren't buying
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.300]   and selling existing homes anymore,
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.460]   we're making more starter homes.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.780]   So you have a low supply in existing home sales.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.300]   Demand still exceeds supply.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.260]   And if mortgage rates fall,
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.420]   I think we're gonna have more demand come in.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.700]   So if I were in the market for a house,
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.180]   I'm putting a bow on this here, okay?
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.980]   I would skip the existing home market altogether
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.260]   and I would build.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.460]   You can get a lower mortgage rate.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.060]   You can find a house that fits your needs and desires.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.780]   Anecdotally, I'm seeing new houses go up
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.140]   in every nook and cranny in my area.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.940]   That wasn't happening a decade ago.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.980]   Anywhere they can find land,
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.940]   they're putting up houses.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.140]   They're knocking down trees.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.420]   They're putting up houses.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.060]   Now, I have gone through the building process
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.140]   multiple times before.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.220]   There are pros and cons to it.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.140]   The pro is you get to pick out the house
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.100]   exactly like you want it.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.940]   It's brand new.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.340]   So it means your maintenance costs going forward
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.780]   are much lower.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.620]   There's no bidding wars.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.060]   There's no back and forth with realtors,
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.860]   any of that stuff, which is good.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.860]   Get a lower mortgage rate, as I mentioned,
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.380]   which is probably more true with national builders
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.220]   and local builders.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.740]   So that kind of depends.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.980]   And then you get time to figure stuff out.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.900]   'Cause it could be, I don't know,
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.540]   12, 18 months until the house is done.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.380]   So you don't have to be in a rush.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.200]   - That's what I was about to ask,
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.040]   what the average time range is.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.880]   - You don't have to be in a rush.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.600]   It probably was six to nine months in the past,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.520]   where now with labor shortages and supply shortages,
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.040]   it might be more like 12 to 15 months.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.000]   The cons include the cost would probably be higher
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.320]   than you think, because a lot of people will do add-ons.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.920]   It's gonna be more, you're gonna want more stuff
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.640]   once you start getting through the process.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.720]   The number of decisions is mind boggling.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.640]   It just melts your brain.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.200]   - I want solar shingles.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.360]   - It's fun to go through like,
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.880]   hey, countertops and cabinets, that's cool.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.220]   But then you get to like,
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.640]   I got to pick out the doorknob colors
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   and the cabinet things.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.600]   And wait, I have to pick out the color of the grout.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.800]   Do you want it light gray or off gray?
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.880]   Or do you want, it's like mind boggling
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.720]   the number of choices you have to make.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.800]   It can take longer than you think,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.520]   and you obviously can't get in a house right away.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.520]   And the other problem for most people is,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.880]   is there land available where you want to build?
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.240]   But, you know, like most financial decisions,
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.080]   there's trade-offs involved.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.760]   But if I was doing it personally,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.200]   and I didn't want to deal with a crazy home market
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.880]   where there's not a lot of supply, I would build.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.240]   Obviously, the big thing is, can you afford it?
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.440]   You can always save for a bigger down payment
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.800]   and keep renting if you can't.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.240]   But my biggest advice to anyone is,
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.880]   don't try to time the housing market.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.160]   If you can afford to buy a place,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.680]   buy it now and worry about the rate stuff later.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.520]   If you can't afford it,
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.400]   then obviously it's not a great time to buy a house ever.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.320]   I just don't see the idea of,
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.980]   I'm going to try to thread the needle
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.000]   and time it perfectly and buy this house
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.560]   when they're down 7%.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.880]   Like, I don't think that way.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.080]   You can afford it, buy it.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.280]   If you can't afford it, don't buy it.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.420]   - You've sold me, you've sold me.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.260]   I have a question.
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.080]   Do you think that we're going to see more rent-to-own
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.360]   situations because of the housing market?
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.480]   - Yeah, I think it makes sense.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.000]   I think that's what all the institutions are going to do.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.280]   Although, they're pulling back right now, too,
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.960]   because rates got so high for them,
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.440]   it made their hurdle rate even higher for their cap rates
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.000]   on what they're making on these houses.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.180]   - Because, yeah, I remember years ago,
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.480]   there's a company called, like, Bizuto, I think.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.680]   And if you rented an apartment from them,
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.360]   they also had communities with houses.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.640]   Something about, like, $1,000 a month of your rent,
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.500]   they put aside for, you know,
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.260]   if you ever wanted to buy a Bizuto home down the road.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.460]   And I've just been curious,
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.740]   because I haven't seen much more of that.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.780]   But, yeah, it seems like that would
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.260]   be getting more and more popular now.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.080]   - Yeah, it makes sense.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.920]   But I don't know how many places
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.900]   they're going to want to sell those houses right now,
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.740]   but, yeah.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.780]   - True, yeah.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.260]   - All right, another question.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.420]   Right from the live chat from last week.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.960]   - Yep, our very own Dave Airy.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.140]   So Dave said, "Why not ask Blair, or Taylor,
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.940]   "or Tony Izola, or other RWM CFPs
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.840]   "about what questions one should ask
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.080]   "a prospective financial advisor?"
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.720]   - All right, ask by name, and we shall make it happen.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.400]   Taylor Hollis.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.240]   - Hey, Taylor. - Hi.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.060]   - How's it going, Taylor?
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.000]   - Good. - Welcome back to the show.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.960]   - Good to be back.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.760]   - All right, so this is a good question.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.500]   Because I think a lot of people
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.220]   get overwhelmed by this process.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.200]   'Cause it's not something you,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.560]   kind of like buying a house and selling a house,
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.640]   you don't do it very often, right?
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.100]   You go through the process of vetting financial planners.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.220]   A lot of times, the people with the best sales pitch
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.300]   are the ones that get you.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.060]   So what do you think are some good questions to ask
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.200]   when vetting financial advice?
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.560]   - I think certainly the questions
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.180]   that we've kind of all heard of.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.340]   Are they a fiduciary?
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.500]   Meaning, are they required to legally put the client,
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.020]   you, your best interest ahead of theirs?
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.740]   How are they-- - Which is certainly
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.940]   a new topic in the last, I don't know, 10 or 15 years.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.280]   It wasn't asked in the past, probably.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.960]   - Sure, right, right.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.000]   - Just a question on the fiduciary thing.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.040]   As a non-financial professional, I'm always confused by this.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.080]   I mean, it is just a word, right?
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.280]   Like, they can always just say, yes, I'm a fiduciary, right?
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.680]   There's no, like, credential they show you or something
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.920]   to prove they're a fiduciary, right?
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.760]   Like, how do you actually know
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.740]   someone's not just telling you that,
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.220]   but then they're not actually gonna
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.800]   abide by the fiduciary? - Well, the follow-on
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.200]   questions would be, how are you paid?
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.680]   How are you compensated?
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.880]   Are you, do you have any affiliation
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.280]   with other financial firms?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.760]   Are there any conflicts of interest?
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.020]   Are you paid based on the products you sell?
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.520]   Or are you paid specifically from the client?
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.160]   And, or, you know, are there any other ways
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.000]   that you make money?
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I think you can kind of drill down to that to understand.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.240]   - Right.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.640]   - What are you incentivized to do for me?
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.360]   And how do you get paid?
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.720]   - How do you get paid is a big one
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.960]   that I think a lot of people go in thinking to ask.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.080]   That's kind of front of mind.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.240]   You know, making sure that interests aligned, right,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.080]   is important.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.880]   I think some that aren't as widely known,
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.280]   one that I really like is ask about the team
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.780]   that you would have access to.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:07.160]   Are you dealing with a one-man show or woman show?
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.960]   Are you dealing with, you know, a whole firm of resources?
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.480]   You know, if you have tax questions
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.240]   or estate planning questions, you know,
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.400]   who do you have access to as part
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.600]   of what you would be paying as a fee?
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:27.000]   So I think knowing that there's a team behind one face
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.160]   is very important.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.080]   - That takes away the key person risk too
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.440]   of getting hit by a bus, right?
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.680]   If you're dealing with...
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.360]   I know plenty of solo practitioners
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.400]   who are very good at what they do
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.880]   and they can wear all those different hats,
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.720]   but it's also a risk of if something goes wrong
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.360]   or that person decides to retire or walk away or whatever.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.400]   So I think another, yeah, another good question is like,
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.000]   what services do you provide?
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.640]   Is this just, 'cause some people just do asset allocation
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.720]   and portfolio management.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.600]   Other people do financial planning and tax planning
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.600]   and estate planning and insurance planning.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.480]   So that's another good one is what exactly can you do
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.720]   for me, even if I don't need it now,
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.160]   maybe I'll need it down the line.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.760]   - Right, another one I really like is,
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.640]   you know, what is your investment philosophy
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.680]   and how are investment decisions made, right?
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.480]   It's one thing to just look at past performance.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.560]   You might like what you see,
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.360]   but how are they making decisions?
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.680]   Are they going off their gut?
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.280]   Are they sticking with rules-based investing?
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.080]   Just having a good grasp of the overall investing philosophy
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.400]   I think is very important.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   - Yeah, that's a big one.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.840]   I think it's also fair to ask,
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.920]   how do you personally invest your assets?
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.560]   You might not have the same allocation or plan as me,
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.720]   but do you follow the similar philosophy and values
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.480]   that you're purporting to the rest of your clients?
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.800]   I think another good one is,
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.200]   is what is the client experience like?
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.800]   How often are we communicating?
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   What's the tech stack or whatever I'm using?
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.520]   How am I getting my information?
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.720]   I think that's something that's important to answer too,
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.200]   is the upfront stuff is good,
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.280]   but how will this relationship look going forward?
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.800]   How are we gonna work together?
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.400]   - Right, right, agreed.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.240]   I like that one.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.080]   Duncan, what do you want to ask to a financial advisor?
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.640]   - Yeah, no, I mean, I think these are all good things.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.400]   I guess I would probably ask like favorite bands,
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.640]   some things like that.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.840]   - I would also ask that, that is important.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.120]   - I think that, yeah, a lot of people
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.360]   just have no idea where to begin.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.800]   And yeah, I think this area is very easy
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.480]   to be taken advantage of,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.440]   especially for people who don't follow finance
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.880]   and don't really know that much about it.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.480]   - It is, 'cause oftentimes the person
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   who's the best salesperson
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.600]   might not have your best interests in mind.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.680]   So I think you want to know,
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.120]   most people want to know, am I gonna be okay?
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.600]   So it's like, how are you gonna create a plan
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.680]   that helps me accomplish my goals?
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.600]   Like, what are we gonna do to get to that point?
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.160]   I think that's what most people want to know.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.800]   Yeah, you're right, there isn't really a checklist
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.320]   for a lot of this stuff.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.760]   It's, in a lot of people, it's kind of feel and body language
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.840]   and these are the things that are hard to quantify.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.840]   - Do you have like, is there a red flag?
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.040]   Is there something that people should all kind of
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.720]   have on their radar, if they hear,
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   that should kind of serve as a red flag?
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.320]   - I think the compensation question
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.960]   could certainly uncover some red flags
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.200]   in the conflict of interest.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.720]   - And like, what would they say
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.160]   that would be a big red flag?
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.560]   - You know, if they're getting, you know,
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.640]   I don't want to say kickbacks,
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.480]   but if, you know, there's just compensation arrangements
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.080]   that might not jive with your best interest,
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.360]   if they're not compensated in a way that aligns.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.200]   - It's more transactional in nature.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.040]   - Right.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.480]   - I make money based on the stuff I sell you
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.560]   and I'm gonna be selling you a lot of stuff.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.200]   So that's the kind of thing, if it's--
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.160]   - Or if I invest in these things, I get paid more.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.840]   - To turn the portfolio or that sort of thing.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.800]   That stuff doesn't happen as much as anymore,
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.120]   but it does still happen.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.680]   The other thing is just, I've seen this in retail space,
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.320]   I've seen this in institutional space,
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.760]   you know, people who prescribe without diagnosing first.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.240]   Like, here's what you need to be invested in right now.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.600]   You need 15% in this and 20% in this
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.480]   without first asking why you need to be invested
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.440]   in something like that in the first place.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.120]   So people who just say,
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.360]   our investment team thinks you need 10% in gold
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.600]   and 5% of this without first,
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.480]   like, does that fit your plan in the first place?
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.120]   So I think if they're not asking you the right questions,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.680]   that's a good red flag as well.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   - Makes sense.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.520]   - Good question, Dave.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.160]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.960]   - Okay, last but not least, we have a question from Alex.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.400]   I follow a fairly conservative 70/30 portfolio
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.120]   and have some questions about how to think about risk.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.600]   I work at a big tech company
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.320]   and stock is more than half of my compensation.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.840]   If this industry were to have troubles,
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.720]   my job market would get pinched.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.200]   Am I doubling up on my risk
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.120]   by investing in a cap-weighted index
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.360]   that has lots of exposure to big tech?
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.960]   Not to brag, but I'm in the highest tax bracket
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.440]   and live in California.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.600]   So the most tax efficient bonds I can own
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.160]   are California bonds.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.520]   How should I think about the risk
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.720]   of owning a California bond fund
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.360]   instead of a total US bond fund or equivalent?
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.200]   - Lots of good stuff in this one here.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.000]   So the first one is more about risk in careers
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.880]   and how you backstop that.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.640]   So the market cap weighting thing,
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.960]   it could be diversifying, as we said before,
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.720]   but it could also be having a less risky attitude
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.480]   towards financial assets.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.840]   And I don't know, having a bigger buffer of cash and bonds,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.160]   if you're really that worried
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.720]   and so much of it is tied in the stock
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.400]   and something goes wrong with a company.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.360]   If the stock is down, you know,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.200]   we saw a lot of tech stocks down 60, 70, 80%
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.640]   as they were laying people off.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.800]   That's a double whammy
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   that you do not want to find yourself in.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.240]   - Well, and I saw a triple whammy in this question.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.600]   You have stock as part of your compensation,
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.440]   which is big tech.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.280]   Your compensation comes from big tech
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.200]   and you're invested in big tech,
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.240]   separate from your employer.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.400]   I'd call that a triple whammy.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.200]   I mean, champagne problems, right?
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.040]   A good problem to have.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.000]   - And if half of the compensation is in stock,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   that means there's a big piece of that portfolio
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   in this company stock as well.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.720]   So, and that's another question we get all the time
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.320]   is what's the line in the sand where I have too much?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.200]   I actually had a conversation with someone just this week
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   saying, "Hey, I'm doing my year-end stuff."
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.920]   And his wife gets a 10% discount for company shares,
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.360]   so they buy a decent amount of it.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.800]   But he's like, "What's too much?"
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.640]   And I think that's a question
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.200]   we get asked all the time as well.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.960]   - Yeah, yeah, and I've personally seen people
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.920]   that they receive stock compensation,
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.480]   and I think because it doesn't feel super tangible,
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.000]   it's easy to forget about.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.840]   And before you know it, you look up
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.900]   and you own way more than you intended.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.740]   So I think for anyone that receives that
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.960]   as a big part of their compensation,
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.920]   be mindful of are you overweight?
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.920]   How can you get out tax efficiently?
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.360]   Like that needs to be,
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.920]   you need to thread the needle on that.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.680]   - Yeah, so you hear the great stuff
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.480]   of Microsoft employees and Apple employees
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.360]   and Google employees making millions,
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.400]   but the other side of that is Enron and Lehman
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.280]   and GE in these places where people have 80, 90%
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.640]   in the company stock, 'cause how could it go wrong?
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.840]   I know this company, that's the downside.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.000]   And I think we've kind of settled on,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.160]   I don't know, anything over 20, 25%
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.960]   is probably a little too risky, especially if you're,
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.520]   so figuring out ways to diversify,
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.160]   even if it means thinking about
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.160]   the tax ramifications of that.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.440]   I think that makes sense.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.000]   So obviously, yeah, you're right.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.800]   It wasn't just doubling up on the risk, it's tripling up.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.360]   So figuring out ways to better diversify
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.320]   and maybe even having a bigger tax or cash buffer.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.080]   The next one is interesting because we have a lot of clients
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.920]   who live in California and New York
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.400]   who end up being in that high tax bracket.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   And so the idea of just holding munis in those bonds
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.400]   gives you a huge buffer on a tax equivalent basis.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.560]   Bill Sweet talked a couple weeks ago
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.920]   about how if you're buying treasuries or T-bills,
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.200]   you're still paying some taxes on those.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.920]   With munis, you have to look at the tax equivalent yield.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.760]   So what do you think about people
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.000]   who live in those high tax states,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.240]   but also are in the highest tax bracket?
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.840]   - I think that the, what you said,
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.360]   looking at the taxable equivalent yield
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.520]   of the state munis, I think oftentimes
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.600]   that's going to come out ahead
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.160]   and there's gonna be a big advantage,
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.760]   especially 'cause those states,
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.400]   they don't just have a state income tax,
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.480]   it's typically substantial.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   And if you can avoid that, that is priority.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.600]   In terms of like, are you thinking
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.320]   exposing themselves too much maybe to that state?
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.840]   - Yeah, maybe there's maybe,
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.000]   remember a number of years ago,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.040]   Meredith Whitney put out the report
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.520]   that all these municipalities are gonna go under
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.320]   and that was a big worry for a couple of years.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.880]   I don't think that, states are actually
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.120]   in a much better place now than they were.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.080]   I think COVID actually helped a lot there.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.600]   But you're right, the tax equivalent yield,
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.280]   if you look at that, if you get a three or 4%
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.160]   immunity bond and you're in the highest tax bracket
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.600]   in one of these states, you could be looking
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.680]   at a seven or 8% tax equivalent yield.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.360]   It's phantom yield for a lot of people,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.960]   you don't actually see it.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.400]   It's just taxes you're not paying.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.880]   But right, for a lot of people,
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.080]   that is the best way to go through it.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.600]   It's just how do you get that exposure?
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.400]   Are you buying these individual bonds yourself?
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.680]   Are you using an ETF or mutual fund
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.640]   that invests directly in these?
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.840]   Yeah, I think that's obviously a much easier way to go
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.400]   if you're looking to diversify exposure
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.720]   and not be stuck to any one bond
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.480]   or municipality or something.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.760]   - Right, exactly.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.080]   And I think that, kind of marrying the two questions
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.240]   together, because this person's compensation
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.560]   is stock and income from a single company,
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.280]   looking to further diversify their other investable assets
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.760]   outside of just that company is important.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.560]   I think using those state munis is a great option.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.880]   - This might be a stupid question,
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.760]   but do you still get all those tax benefits
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.440]   if you're buying a municipal bond ETF?
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.040]   Or do you have to actually outright hold
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.080]   the municipal bonds themselves?
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.720]   - Yeah, and there are California
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.400]   or New York ETFs that do this.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.120]   - Right, because they're notorious for,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.800]   the higher income tax states have those ETFs
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.640]   that you can own.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.320]   - Yeah, most of those fund companies will have a Cal,
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.600]   yeah, so yeah, you get those state tax benefits, yes.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.440]   - Okay, cool.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.280]   - For buying ETFs.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.840]   So yeah, that's another, yeah, potentially triple whammy
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.040]   'cause it could be local, state, and federal taxes
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.360]   that you're saving some money on.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.880]   So yeah, it's a pretty good deal.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.400]   But I think this person is thinking about things
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.000]   in the right way, that's a good first step.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.600]   'Cause a lot of people with the risk piece
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.440]   that you mentioned, they might think
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.400]   that they're even safer because I'm making my money
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.120]   in this company and I own the stock
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.520]   and I know it really well and I'm fine, right?
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.800]   But this person I think is thinking about it the right way.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.200]   - I agree.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.360]   - I like it, we talked everything from junk bonds
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.800]   to municipal bonds today, you know?
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.440]   Bonds are so hot.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.200]   Programming notes, we have a few.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.480]   No show next week, right, we're off for the holidays.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.800]   We've hired more people on the production team.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.840]   Duncan's getting some help.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.920]   So going forward in the new year for this show,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.560]   we are going to be airing live
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.800]   'cause we have all the people in the live chat
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.920]   we appreciate and some people have mentioned,
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.520]   it's kind of hard on a 1/30 Eastern on a Thursday
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.400]   to get off so we couldn't do it before
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.240]   because production, I blame Duncan, it's Duncan's fault.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.800]   We're gonna start releasing these at 5 Eastern now
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.280]   which gives hopefully people more time.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.400]   So the new show, I think it's January 4th,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.160]   Ask the Compound will go live every Thursday
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.000]   at 5 Eastern and every Thursday from then on,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.240]   we'll be at 5 Eastern.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.360]   - But wait, there's more.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.720]   So not exactly live, we're gonna be doing live premieres
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.320]   so Ben and I can actually carry on my conversations
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.200]   in the chat and be more engaged with people in the chat
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.520]   than we are currently when we're actually
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.680]   trying to do the show.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.960]   But also it will allow us to up our production value
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.360]   and do some cooler stuff and have a little more consistent
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.160]   quality and audio, things like that
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.320]   since we'll be recording earlier in the day.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.800]   - Yeah, it's one of the reasons we did it live like this
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   'cause we didn't have the resources.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.640]   Now we have the resources.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.160]   - Yeah, we really didn't have time to edit, yeah, basically.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:34.600]   So yeah, exciting.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.720]   - So fun stuff.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.680]   Thank you to Taylor for coming back on the show.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.240]   We appreciate it.
