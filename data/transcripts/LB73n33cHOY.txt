[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   So last month, Ezra Klein went on the How I Write podcast.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.840]   The host, David Perel, asked Ezra about using AI for his writing,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.100]   and Ezra's answer generated some controversy.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.300]   It began when Ezra said the following, and I quote,
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.500]   I think it is very dangerous to use ChatGPT in any serious way for writing.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.360]   Ezra then goes on to give some reasons for this claim.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.400]   And one of the reasons is that AI can help you rewrite or polish or check what you've written,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.360]   but it can't tell you if the ideas itself are good or not.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.860]   As Ezra elaborates, you have to be attuned to that voice in you.
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.840]   It's like, not right, not right, not right, not right.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.660]   You're not trying to bypass that or get around it or get to where it's soft.
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.440]   You're trying to get to the point where you're like, ah, got it right.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.880]   And that's usually intellectual labor.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.200]   Ezra later adds, ChatGPT can't identify fundamentally wrong ideas.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.600]   When later asked specifically about AI and journalism, Ezra says,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.000]   I'm not completely against anything, and I have not, and not for lack of trying,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.800]   and I think not for lack of being informed or interested in the issue,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.980]   found a way that I consistently use AI in my work.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.140]   I'll sometimes use it right now as a replacement for Google searches,
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.720]   and it's valuable for that.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.400]   A lot of people appreciated Ezra's points,
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.220]   but some people, including several I know and who wrote into the show,
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.500]   thought that his stance was nostalgic and out of touch,
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000]   like sticking with a typewriter in the age of word processors.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.620]   A few cranky people might do it,
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.340]   but it's basically just a worse process that makes you slower at your craft.
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.800]   The future of writing, they're convinced,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.880]   must include a symbiotic relationship with AI.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.320]   So who is right on this point, Ezra or AI's defenders?
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.860]   Well, this question has been on my mind,
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.480]   and that's when I saw that my good friend and longtime friend of the show,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.320]   the author Brad Stolberg, sent me an Instagram post,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.640]   which he had recently published about a new paper that came out to MIT
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.660]   that took a closer look at the impact of using AI in writing.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.740]   This post hit a nerve online and it caught my attention too.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.040]   This paper, I would argue, points us towards a stronger,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.220]   broader argument about AI writing in our culture
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.560]   that shows Ezra is perhaps onto something.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.920]   Anyway, here's the good news.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.900]   In a coincidence of timing,
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.860]   Brad is here in DC visiting his family.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.100]   So I asked him if he would swing by the HQ
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.020]   to talk with me about this paper
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.840]   and get into it on this topic for our deep dive today.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.340]   And fortunately, he agreed.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.080]   So we are joined today by Brad.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.920]   Brad, thanks for coming.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.720]   Hey, it's great to be here, Cal.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.460]   So tell me about this paper that you wrote about.
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.240]   What is it?
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.860]   Who wrote it?
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.980]   What's the big points?
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.840]   The paper is called
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.120]   Your Brain on Chat GPT,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.400]   Accumulation of Cognitive Debt
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.380]   When Using an AI Assistant for an Essay Writing Task.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.960]   The paper came out of MIT
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.580]   and the highest level summary is
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.760]   for four months,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.940]   a team of researchers from the MIT Media Lab
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.660]   followed 54 study participants
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.840]   who were using Chat GPT
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.860]   to heavily assist them in writing essays.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.760]   And the top line finding,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.140]   and I'm going to quote the research,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.200]   the top line finding,
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.880]   and I'm going to quote the researchers directly,
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.900]   is that LLM users consistently underperformed
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.680]   at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.260]   So those are the three things.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.840]   Those are the three things that they evaluated.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.440]   On the neural level,
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.500]   EEG brain studies found that
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.320]   there was a 47% reduction in brain activity
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.360]   with the heavy Chat GPT users.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.320]   So their brains were using 47% less neural connections
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.640]   as they were quote-unquote writing.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.400]   I guess in this case,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.320]   they were getting a lot of help from the model.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.700]   Behaviorally, researchers found that
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.720]   83% of the heavy model users
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.960]   couldn't quote anything from what they'd just written.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.300]   This compares to about 10%
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.760]   from the group that used no technology,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.280]   and very similarly about 13%
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.860]   from the group that used a simple Google search
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.200]   to aid them in their writing.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.560]   And then on the linguistic level,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.860]   they had neutral arbiters
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.820]   give subjective, qualitative analyses of the writing.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.080]   And words that came up repeatedly
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.760]   to describe the AI writing was,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.300]   and I'm quoting,
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.160]   soulless, empty, lacking individuality, typical.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.920]   Now, the last thing that I'll say
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.860]   is perhaps the biggest finding from this study,
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.300]   and it's right there in the title,
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.840]   this term cognitive debt.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.960]   And what the researchers found is that,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.280]   yes, using Chat GPT to write for you
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.720]   is absolutely more efficient than writing yourself.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.080]   You don't have any cognitive strain.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.840]   It's not hard.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.100]   You just put the prompt in,
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.220]   you massage it a little bit,
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.840]   and it's done.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.080]   And they looked at the time required,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.420]   and they finished earlier.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.640]   Of course they finished earlier,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.960]   because they're just prompting the model.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   So, yes, you have this short-term benefit,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.540]   if you will,
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.680]   of being much more efficient.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   But what you pay in the long term
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.860]   to get that benefit
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.980]   seems like tenfold the cost
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.460]   in decreased cognitive fitness
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.280]   and cognitive health,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.740]   and that's the term cognitive debt.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.000]   They essentially argue
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.760]   that when we use AI to write for us,
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.800]   we pick up a fair amount of cognitive debt.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.520]   We are mortgaging our future cognitive fitness,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.620]   really our ability to think for ourselves
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.820]   for this sort of short-term efficiency.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.260]   I mean, this is interesting.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.120]   It reminds me of the article I told you about
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.800]   that I wrote last year for The New Yorker,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.880]   and it was about students using AI for writing.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.660]   And I looked virtually over the shoulder
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.260]   of a graduate student writing a paper.
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.300]   And that's what surprised me,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.020]   and this was one of the points of that article,
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.260]   is it wasn't about speed for the student.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.340]   It wasn't about producing text
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.140]   they otherwise couldn't.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.460]   Like, oh, this is somehow going to produce writing
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.440]   I'm not ready to produce.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.140]   It mainly seemed to be about strain reduction.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.620]   That's what really seemed to be going on
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.060]   is that writing is a pain.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.940]   Quite literally, like cognitively,
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.400]   it doesn't feel good to write.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.620]   And they would go back and forth with the,
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.020]   what about this, what about that?
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.220]   And it gave them all these moments of release from strain,
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.980]   or sometimes it would take them a long time
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.960]   to get a sentence by just asking the model again and again.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.860]   But it was better than, from a strain perspective,
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.740]   than the de novo construction, right?
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.200]   It's easier to ask questions of a model
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.920]   than to produce stuff from scratch with the brain.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.460]   But, okay, but this is interesting.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.780]   This cognitive debt idea,
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.120]   it's arguing there is this huge benefit
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.720]   that comes from writing.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.240]   And yet we often think about productivity enhancing tools
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.100]   and making things easier.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.080]   How do you understand
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.980]   what is the dividing line between activity
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.440]   where you want it to be hard
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.260]   versus the hardness is a bug,
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.160]   not a feature?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.600]   I think that's at the core of this argument.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.180]   And I think you're spot on.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.240]   The metaphor that I used in the little mini essay
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.660]   that I wrote for Instagram
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.000]   is this notion of fitness.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.840]   So if you think about physical fitness,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.460]   there's a whole manner of reasons
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.800]   that one would train their body.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.560]   But let's just focus on physical health.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.380]   We know that lifting weights, running,
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.660]   pushing yourself physically
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.220]   is good for your health.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.520]   You live longer is associated
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.260]   with reduced risk of certain diseases,
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.380]   both physical and cognitive and so on.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.560]   Now, if you went to the gym
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.120]   with a forklift or some other apparatus
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.880]   to lift the weight for you,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.920]   you could spend the same hour in the gym,
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.500]   but it would be much more comfortable.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.620]   You wouldn't be straining.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.600]   And that gym session would be a lot easier,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.440]   but you wouldn't accrue those health benefits.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.060]   And I think essentially what's happening
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.060]   when we over-rely on a tool like ChatGPT
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.900]   to write for us
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.360]   is we're sacrificing our cognitive fitness.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.340]   We are replacing the strain of thinking,
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.020]   of writing, with a forklift.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.720]   In this term, the, excuse me,
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.340]   we're replacing it with a forklift.
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:17.940]   And in this case,
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.940]   it's the model that does the work for us.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.340]   And I think the result is a decline
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.260]   in cognitive health and cognitive fitness.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.360]   And that's precisely what this paper showed.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.740]   Another point I'll make real quick, Cal,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.880]   before turning it back to you,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.860]   is the researchers also found
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.320]   that when they took ChatGPT away
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.060]   from the group that had been using it
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.780]   for four months,
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.680]   they wrote worse than people
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.640]   who had never used ChatGPT before.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.600]   This is scary.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.680]   Exactly.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.900]   That's interesting.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.700]   So you're losing familiarity
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.820]   with the mental processes
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.520]   yet required to produce thought.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.040]   I mean,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.060]   something that comes to mind here
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.920]   is when I wrote that article
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.580]   for The New Yorker,
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.020]   I went deep
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.720]   on what happens in your brain
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.320]   when you write.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.860]   And it is really complicated, right?
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.000]   Because writing is unnatural.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.320]   We're not evolved to write.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.240]   Linguistic communication
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.200]   is a cultural invention,
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.000]   not an evolutionary invention.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.420]   So in order to write,
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.360]   we have to hijack
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.580]   a lot of different parts of our brain
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.100]   and get them to work together.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.440]   There's like visual cortexes involved.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.720]   There's spatial reasoning involved.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.420]   I didn't learn this
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.160]   until I read this.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.480]   But there's a spatial reasoning component,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.440]   the same part of your brain
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.180]   you use to keep a map in your head,
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.420]   like how do I get from here
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.800]   back to the watering hole?
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.020]   That gets used
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.320]   to spatially position
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.760]   the outline of your arguments
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.540]   in your heads.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.240]   You're trying to understand
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.020]   where you are
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.200]   in an abstract argument.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.500]   The visual cortex
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.460]   brings up images.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.580]   The linguistic centers
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.760]   bring up like words.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.480]   The auditory centers
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.380]   like convert those words
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.000]   to sounds.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.160]   You can think about
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.040]   how to put them into words.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.380]   I think I used the term
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.140]   as like a symphony
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.660]   being conducted
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.800]   in your brain.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.280]   This is probably
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:48.980]   all very beneficial.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.660]   We know this
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.940]   in the context of reading.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.480]   So there's research
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.880]   on what reading does for us
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.420]   and writing is just
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.560]   reading in reverse.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.100]   You're producing the words
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.660]   instead of reading it.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.420]   But we know reading,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.680]   the research from Marianne Wolfe
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.780]   among others argues,
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.240]   we develop these deep processes,
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.300]   deep reading processes,
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.160]   which creates stronger connections
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.240]   between all these brain areas.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.600]   Once they've been formed,
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.220]   then you can access them
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:12.680]   more easily.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.540]   Now you can access
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.180]   and string together
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.140]   different parts of your brain
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.780]   and it allows for
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.540]   more advanced reasoning,
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.540]   more sophisticated reasoning,
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.460]   more empathy, etc.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.520]   So I guess this is
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.080]   what they're seeing probably
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.240]   when EEG's activity goes down
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.200]   or using chat GPT
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.300]   is you're probably taking
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.700]   whole parts of your brain offline
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.220]   that you otherwise
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.040]   would be using
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.020]   during the writing process
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.860]   and so those connections
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.660]   aren't getting strengthened.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.400]   So like the equivalent
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.420]   of the muscle getting stronger
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.940]   is probably literally neurons
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.420]   wiring together
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.960]   because they were firing together.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.600]   And so if we think about it
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.480]   like cognitive weightlifting,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.500]   yeah, I think you're
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.140]   absolutely right.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.420]   Like those muscles
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.940]   aren't getting worked.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.360]   but that's what I was
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:48.840]   trying to figure out.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.540]   What's the context
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.400]   where we want to get stronger?
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.180]   Right?
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.380]   Because we do use forklifts
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.960]   to follow the physical analogy.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.220]   Like if I'm in a warehouse,
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.980]   a forklift is great
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.560]   because we used to have to use,
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.040]   you know,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.900]   the longshoremen
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.420]   would have to pick things up
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.200]   and hurt their backs
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.400]   or use pulleys
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.480]   and forklifts are better.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.740]   We can move things onto it.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.560]   But in the gym,
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.520]   I want to do the work.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.880]   So how do we think about this?
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.180]   Like how do you think about it
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.600]   in intellectual work?
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   I think it's a trade-off
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.740]   between what capacities
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.820]   do we want to maintain
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.540]   and strengthen
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.820]   versus what capacities
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.360]   are we okay letting go?
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.260]   By no means
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.200]   am I personally
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.780]   an anti-AI purist.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.480]   I think there are
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.020]   so many good use cases.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.900]   And I do think it's true
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.080]   that whenever there's
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.840]   a new technology,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.620]   there tends to be
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.620]   this kind of hysteria
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.560]   or moral panic.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.820]   It happened with the fire.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.960]   It happened with the wheel.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.980]   The Industrial Revolution
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.860]   was so beneficial
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.620]   for so many different reasons.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.220]   However,
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.000]   there's tons of public health data
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.960]   that shows
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.680]   that the invention
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.520]   of the vacuum cleaner,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.280]   for example,
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.480]   helped people
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.960]   to clean a lot faster.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.600]   And as a result,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.180]   you are a lot more sedentary
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.940]   because you're not having
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.640]   to crouch down
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.580]   and stand back up
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.520]   and cover your whole house
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.320]   on your hands and knees
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:01.760]   to clean.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.120]   Is it good
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.980]   that we have vacuum cleaners?
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.220]   Yes.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.720]   But if we don't replace that,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.500]   then you have
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.560]   these negative health consequences.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.360]   you have obesity
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.340]   if you're just sedentary
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:10.880]   all the time.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.080]   And I think that
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.220]   when it comes to something
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.100]   like writing,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.280]   which really is
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.360]   maybe the best proxy
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.520]   that we have for thinking,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.140]   and if you want to think well,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.520]   then it helps to write well,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.280]   I don't think
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.320]   that we should be so flippant
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.200]   with outsourcing
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.180]   our ability to think.
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.180]   Our ability to think
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.220]   is a central feature
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:29.860]   of our humanity.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.660]   In many ways,
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.520]   it separates us
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.580]   from other species.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.120]   We can very quickly
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.600]   become like Pavlov's dog
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.680]   putting something
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.320]   into the AI.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.320]   It responds.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.020]   we either like it
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.520]   or we don't.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.300]   We give it a thumbs up
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:40.880]   or a thumbs down.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.040]   We ask it the next question
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.260]   and then we're sacrificing
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.460]   so much of our humanity.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.240]   Now,
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.900]   if AI
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.340]   was going to
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.720]   be able to,
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.380]   let's say,
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.680]   run a gazillion
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.900]   different permutations
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.540]   to somehow get
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.480]   to the bottom of cancer,
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.000]   well then the cost benefit
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.660]   is pretty clear.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.680]   Let it do that.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.700]   Let it use all of its
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.340]   computing power
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.240]   to figure that out.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.740]   But in the case of writing,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.280]   we're essentially
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.620]   letting AI think for us.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.820]   And I just don't think
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.520]   that that's a smart thing
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.040]   to outsource.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.140]   I like this idea,
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:07.600]   by the way,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.300]   of a moral panic
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.580]   around the invention
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.060]   of fire.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.380]   I like to think of
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.820]   like a Stone Age John Height.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.440]   When these kids
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.820]   are looking at this fire,
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.520]   they're not out there
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.760]   learning how to mammoth hunt.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.720]   And do we really want kids
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.580]   who can't mammoth hunt?
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.200]   Come on, fire.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.000]   Fire is a problem.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.320]   So then what if we say,
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:23.860]   let me throw,
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.580]   I'll throw out a proposal.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.400]   You tell me what you think.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.360]   School, don't use LLMs.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.400]   It defeats the whole purpose.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.800]   School is the closest thing
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.980]   we have to an intellectual gym.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.520]   So why would we put
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.200]   a Forklift or Echo Skeleton
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:36.820]   in the gym?
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.920]   That's the whole point
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.000]   of writing in school.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.440]   It's not getting us
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.240]   to something else
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.320]   that we're trying to get to
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.460]   and making that more efficient
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.140]   would be good.
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.660]   The writing itself
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.960]   would be the case.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.000]   So I'm going to say school,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.020]   don't use LLMs
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:52.760]   to write at all.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.480]   I would say maybe
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.900]   if you're a professional writer too.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.340]   This seems to be Ezra's argument.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.000]   It's like I do this for a living.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.520]   If you listen to this,
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:00.840]   you know,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.020]   I'm trying to be really,
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.020]   really good at this.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.460]   The outsource parts of my thinking,
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.160]   my thinking is what I'm paid for.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160]   Like that's the whole ball game.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.240]   This doesn't make sense to me.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.080]   Like why would I want
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.720]   to outsource any?
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.060]   All I do is write these scripts
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.520]   for my episodes.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.640]   That's my whole job
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.020]   to make that a little bit faster.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.440]   Like what am I trying to do here?
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.100]   This is not,
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:22.740]   it doesn't get me
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.640]   to something else faster.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.080]   So, okay.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.240]   Do you agree with those
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.840]   or am I missing something?
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.320]   School,
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.640]   professional writing,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.460]   you shouldn't be using LLMs
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.020]   in the actual
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.120]   like crafting a prose process.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.480]   I don't know.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.400]   Am I getting this right?
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.060]   I'm sort of doing this
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:37.700]   on the fly here.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.380]   I'm doing it on the fly with you.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.300]   I do think you're getting it right.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.860]   I think that you would add
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.000]   maybe composing music
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.600]   or if you're going to be writing
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.680]   emails or notes
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.740]   to family members
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.060]   that feel important.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.960]   Essentially,
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.020]   if you step back
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.740]   and you look at this
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.860]   maybe more philosophically
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.440]   or spiritually,
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.340]   if there are activities
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.280]   that require strain
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.320]   in the short term,
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.040]   but in the long term,
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.760]   you derive satisfaction from,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.480]   then those are activities
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.040]   worth protecting.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.460]   So,
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.100]   the thought experiment
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.660]   that makes this so simple
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.560]   because it's an extreme
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.160]   is imagine
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.540]   that you could
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.600]   press one button
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.680]   and perhaps we'll get here
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.120]   in a few years,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.560]   who knows,
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.680]   and you could say,
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.380]   I want a Grammy
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.820]   award-winning folk song.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.500]   And you press that button
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.640]   and the song comes out
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.280]   and you spend maybe
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.440]   30 minutes going back
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.380]   and forth making edits
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.980]   and then you win the Grammy.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.260]   Would you be as satisfied
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.220]   with that Grammy
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:31.900]   than if you worked
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.420]   on that album
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.220]   for two years
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.180]   and the lion's share,
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:35.880]   if not all of it,
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.740]   came out of your brain?
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.440]   I don't think so.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.020]   I think that you'd be
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.740]   much more satisfying
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.480]   if you did the work.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:40.640]   Now,
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.140]   there could be a world
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.020]   where a part of doing
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.400]   that work
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.180]   is using this
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:44.880]   as a tool
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.220]   but that's very different
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.280]   than relying on it
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.100]   or having it replace
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.840]   the actual act.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.000]   So,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.240]   I think it's twofold.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.960]   I think it's exactly
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.540]   what you said
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.220]   which is you don't want
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.380]   to use it in areas
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.140]   that are core
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.040]   to how you live your life,
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.200]   how you make your living,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.620]   how,
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.020]   you know,
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.200]   if you get paid to think
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.140]   or you're a knowledge worker,
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.040]   you want to be really careful
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.600]   about protecting
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.800]   your ability to think
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.120]   and I think
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.020]   we just need to be careful
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:06.680]   of this,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.660]   you know,
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.360]   this is a tale
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:08.960]   as old as time,
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.480]   this trade-off
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.780]   between short-term convenience
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.280]   and long-term satisfaction
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.400]   and I personally
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:14.980]   am hesitant
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.640]   to outsource
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.900]   things that are hard
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.380]   in the moment
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.680]   but give me satisfaction,
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.480]   make me content,
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.440]   make me satiated,
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.560]   allow me to feel
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.440]   like I'm falling asleep
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.620]   after a good day's work
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.680]   because I put in the effort.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.420]   I don't want to click
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:26.940]   two buttons
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.860]   and have that done for me.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.880]   I have a term
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.520]   I just invented.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.740]   You're so good
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.380]   at naming things.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:31.580]   All right,
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.160]   what do you think about this?
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.400]   And it's an adjustment
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.040]   of existing term,
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.040]   type two thinking.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.000]   Ooh.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.520]   Right?
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.200]   So,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.160]   type two fun
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.380]   is this well-known term
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.640]   for activities
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.980]   that like aren't fun
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.540]   in the moment
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.220]   while you're doing them
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.180]   like hard mountaineering
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:44.900]   or something like this
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.760]   or a really hard workout
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.840]   but it's very satisfying
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.920]   and fun when you're done.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.040]   You're glad that you've done them.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.380]   We should have the same thing
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:50.760]   for thinking.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.560]   Type two thinking
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.580]   is difficult in the moment.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.460]   The blank page
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.860]   is difficult in the moment
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.100]   but having composed
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.220]   something that you're proud of
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.700]   is like deeply satisfying
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.160]   and long-term,
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.140]   you know it's going to make you
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.160]   better and smarter
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.360]   and so you think about
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.000]   type two thinking
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.780]   like type two fun.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.100]   Like, yeah,
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.260]   the hardness is the feature here.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.780]   Maybe that'll catch on.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.320]   I don't know.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.120]   I love that
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.860]   and I also think
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.100]   that there's a chance
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:13.920]   that in the future
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.600]   we'll have essentially
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.920]   cognitive gyms
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.380]   where like you set aside time
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.520]   and you say
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.880]   during this hour and a half
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.580]   I'm not going to use
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.400]   the model at all.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.680]   I'm going to walk
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.260]   on a treadmill
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.940]   instead of drive the car.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.840]   I do have one question
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.260]   for you
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.400]   and this is going to be
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.520]   perhaps some pushback
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.400]   from your listeners.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.140]   I know that people
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.820]   who read my work
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.080]   are probably thinking this.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.600]   I think the pushback
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:34.980]   would be
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.000]   this is a tool
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.220]   and it's all about
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.060]   how you use it
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.000]   and what if
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.440]   you get the type two hard
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.540]   by getting better
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.400]   at using the tool?
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.780]   So why would you spend
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.520]   two hours writing
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.940]   if you could sit there
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.800]   and prompt the tool
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.680]   back and forth
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.900]   and you're still going to have
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.720]   that cognitive strain
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.320]   and it's still going to be
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.140]   really effortful
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.300]   and it's going to be
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.240]   as you said in the opening
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.420]   a symbiotic relationship
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.420]   where the skill
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.100]   that you're developing
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.800]   or the competency
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.620]   that you're developing
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.200]   is prompting
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.860]   and using the tool.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.360]   I think it's a much more
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.220]   probably the response
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:04.360]   would be
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:04.800]   it's a much more
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.180]   narrow cognitive activity
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.760]   right?
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.420]   Like there is
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.880]   some like
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.020]   sophistication
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.260]   you're like
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.100]   look when I'm in the gym
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.140]   and I have the animatronic
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.960]   that's lifting the weights
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.280]   for me
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:13.980]   there's a lot of
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.380]   I have to like control it
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.420]   and make a lot of decisions
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.200]   and move this lever
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.740]   and that lever
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.660]   it's not easy right
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.100]   to get it
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.100]   it's a different type of hard
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.120]   but it's not
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.140]   the type of hard
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.620]   that you're hoping
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.260]   to get out of the gym
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.240]   which was getting stronger
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.140]   so prompting
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.080]   carefully
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.080]   to try to work
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.800]   back and forth
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.540]   to get out stuff
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.280]   you can use
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.240]   is probably a much more
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:31.960]   narrower band
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.420]   of your mind
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:32.820]   you're using
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.540]   it's a very sort of
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.700]   like tool functional type
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.600]   we're already good
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.380]   at that by the way
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:36.840]   like we're
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.300]   we are very good
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:38.960]   at like using
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.500]   these type of
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.500]   consumer facing tools
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:40.960]   which are made
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.760]   to be really easy
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.100]   that's not necessarily
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.760]   something we have
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.640]   to work really hard at
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.060]   whereas the connections
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.260]   we get in writing
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.980]   those are hard one
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.200]   they make you smarter
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.360]   they make you more empathetic
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.100]   you're able to better
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.060]   understand the world
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.160]   and manipulate ideas
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.940]   which I think is
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.140]   more of a superpower
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.500]   I mean
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.140]   I don't know
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:57.600]   I'll ask you where
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.160]   you would draw your line
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.000]   I think I'm probably
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.020]   similar to Ezra here
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.560]   it
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.140]   I think
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.040]   these tools
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.700]   are fine
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.380]   as a better
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.000]   Google search
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.480]   we're kind of
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.020]   already used to
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.740]   doing Google searches
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.440]   sometimes it's like
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.040]   a Google search
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.500]   that'll do some
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.200]   summaries for you
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.220]   I have to be a little
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:12.940]   bit careful about it
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.600]   because it hallucinates
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:13.900]   a lot
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.720]   but that can be useful
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.060]   sometimes if I'm
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.120]   writing an article
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.800]   on deadline
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.360]   I'll do some
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.400]   copy editing with it
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.540]   not that I
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.580]   I can't copy edit
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.080]   myself
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.480]   but that
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.400]   you know
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.980]   if I'm in a hurry
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.460]   I'll sometimes
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:28.680]   be like
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.500]   hey I'll let
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.160]   LLM help me
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.620]   copy edit
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.200]   because if this is
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.040]   cleaner grammatically
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:33.520]   it's just going to
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:33.920]   make the next
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.560]   editing pass
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.540]   faster
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.160]   like I wouldn't
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.760]   necessarily bother
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.280]   with a book
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:37.700]   because we have
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.020]   time
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.120]   but if it's on a
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.520]   tight deadline
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.080]   for an article
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.960]   I might do that
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.460]   I'm wary about
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.220]   deep research
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.440]   unless it's really
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.020]   hey here's some
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.060]   quantitative data
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.600]   I kind of know
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.320]   where it is
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.040]   will you
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.020]   O2 or something
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.020]   put this into
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.160]   a spreadsheet
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.040]   or into a format
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.780]   like actually do
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.560]   data manipulation
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.320]   in a way that makes
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:55.860]   it easier to work
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.320]   with like that
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:56.960]   makes sense to me
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.820]   I'm a little bit
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.640]   more wary of like
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.380]   hey go summarize
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.520]   everything on this
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.280]   topic because I
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.720]   just don't think
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.200]   it does a good
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.820]   job and also
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.500]   that's part of
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:03.920]   the work of
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.560]   journalism is
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.140]   knowing like
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.620]   your sources
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.200]   and following
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:06.720]   those trails
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.340]   I think it
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:07.780]   doesn't do a
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.220]   great job
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:08.880]   I don't know
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.460]   that's where I
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.600]   am but maybe
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:10.900]   we're being
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.640]   arbitrary here
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.400]   but I draw the
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.000]   line where it's
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.580]   like the actual
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.440]   construction of the
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.680]   ideas or
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.800]   prose like
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.500]   I'm filling
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.420]   the blank page
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:19.840]   when you have
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.300]   your sources
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.920]   I think I
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.240]   agree with
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:21.680]   Ezra there
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.580]   you grapple
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.740]   you make all
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.420]   these connections
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.060]   you write
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.960]   it goes slow
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.760]   20 minutes in
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.200]   it starts to
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:27.920]   pick up speed
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.240]   that's where a
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.700]   lot of interesting
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.280]   stuff happens
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:30.880]   but your cognitive
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.360]   let me go back
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.840]   to your cognitive
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.500]   gem idea
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.640]   in some sense
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.000]   that's what we
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.720]   want to avoid
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.860]   like what we
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.380]   want to avoid
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:36.800]   is getting in
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.480]   a world where
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:37.860]   this I mean
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.380]   it's exactly
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:38.900]   what happened
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.260]   as you said
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:39.660]   in physical
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.020]   health
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.080]   we became
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.540]   much more
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.080]   sedentary
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.520]   and then had
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.100]   to invent
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.660]   activities
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.220]   just to try
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:44.500]   to get
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.180]   some exercise
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.080]   back
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.100]   we could do
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.820]   this intellectually
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.660]   we kind
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.380]   of outsource
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.220]   all of our
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:50.660]   thinking
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.260]   our brains
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:51.580]   are much
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.080]   worse
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.580]   and now
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:52.900]   there's like
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.200]   a small
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.800]   number of us
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.180]   that have to
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:54.460]   like go to
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.120]   cognitive gyms
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.500]   to like try
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:55.740]   to keep
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.060]   the brain
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:56.300]   up
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.860]   or we could
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.140]   just not
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:57.740]   outsource the
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.100]   intellectual
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.680]   activities
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.500]   because having
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.120]   my student
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.820]   paper written
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:02.360]   faster
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.600]   it doesn't
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   it doesn't
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.020]   make my
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.580]   it doesn't
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:04.980]   make
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.060]   open up
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:06.240]   new
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.880]   opportunities
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.000]   or like
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.360]   open up
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:08.860]   new economic
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.360]   opportunities
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:09.880]   or growth
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.280]   it's just
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:10.500]   sort of
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:10.880]   convenience
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.240]   in the
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:11.460]   moment
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.060]   I want
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:12.220]   to
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.520]   it would
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:12.840]   be nice
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.380]   to avoid
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:13.980]   the cognitive
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.520]   gyms
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.480]   and so
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.060]   thinking
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:16.580]   about type
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:16.760]   two
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.080]   thinking
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:17.340]   maybe
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:17.580]   that's
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:17.800]   the way
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.060]   to do
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.260]   it
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.180]   unsurprisingly
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:20.760]   I'm going
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.300]   to completely
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:21.940]   agree
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.680]   with you
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.040]   here
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.820]   we can
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.240]   continue
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.800]   to build
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.360]   this metaphor
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:25.740]   out
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.300]   in a way
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:26.760]   that I
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.180]   have found
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.980]   really helpful
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.800]   in relation
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.460]   to health
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:29.880]   and fitness
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.700]   so we
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.260]   talked about
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.440]   the production
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.640]   of writing
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.320]   or thinking
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.640]   and we
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:35.960]   made the
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.260]   parallel
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.780]   to lifting
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.120]   weights
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.440]   and sometimes
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:38.920]   you do want
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.340]   to outsource
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:39.880]   lifting the
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.240]   heavy thing
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.460]   at the
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:40.740]   warehouse
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.440]   but if
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:41.900]   the goal
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.240]   is to
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:42.520]   maintain
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.000]   strength
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.240]   in this
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.420]   case
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:43.660]   if the
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:43.800]   goal
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.100]   is to
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.780]   maintain
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.220]   the ability
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:45.520]   to think
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:45.980]   for ourselves
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.460]   we certainly
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:46.960]   don't want
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.680]   to outsource
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:47.980]   that
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.120]   I would
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.420]   say at
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:49.620]   all
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.240]   but we
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.360]   don't
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:50.540]   want to
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:50.720]   become
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.120]   reliant
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.440]   on it
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.560]   the
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.380]   metaphor
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:53.980]   extends
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.520]   to what
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:54.680]   we
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.200]   consume
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.560]   so at
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:55.840]   the same
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.100]   time
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.240]   we
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.660]   underwent
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:56.900]   the
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.280]   industrial
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:57.800]   revolution
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.080]   and we
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.360]   became
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:58.580]   more
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.180]   sedentary
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.020]   there
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.240]   was
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:00.560]   also
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:00.820]   this
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.340]   massive
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:01.760]   change
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:01.920]   in
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.120]   food
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.620]   technology
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.200]   and the
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:03.560]   creation
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.200]   of

[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.100]   processed
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:06.540]   foods
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.540]   and
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:07.880]   highly
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.260]   processed
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:08.680]   foods
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.140]   are
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:09.840]   easy
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.260]   they're
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:10.820]   convenient
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.980]   they taste
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.300]   great
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.680]   they have
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.000]   a kind
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.220]   of
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:13.840]   addictive
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.620]   quality
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.060]   about
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:15.340]   them
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:15.820]   the more
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.120]   that you
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.340]   eat
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:16.520]   them
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:16.960]   the harder
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.500]   it is
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.200]   to enjoy

[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.620]   and
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.120]   what
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:21.380]   happens
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:21.500]   when
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:21.580]   you
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:21.720]   eat
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:21.860]   too

[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.320]   is
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.800]   you
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.360]   have

[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:05.840]   of

[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:52.880]   the
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.040]   very
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.280]   best
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:53.580]   models
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:53.740]   so
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:53.900]   some
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:54.080]   people
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:54.380]   disagree
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:54.620]   with
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:54.740]   me
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:54.880]   on
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.080]   that
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:55.460]   but
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:55.580]   it
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:55.740]   is
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.040]   possible
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:56.180]   with
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:56.400]   AI
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:56.640]   just
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:56.800]   not
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:56.960]   the
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.200]   systems
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:57.380]   we
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:57.660]   have
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.640]   right
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:58.960]   now
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.100]   all right
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:00.600]   what do we got next
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:00.840]   Jesse
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.040]   next up is
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.520]   Michelle
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.180]   I feel like I'm
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.720]   incredibly disorganized
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.480]   in my work life
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.580]   what's the smallest
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.720]   possible first step
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.400]   I can take to
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.140]   generate real
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:10.680]   improvement
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.760]   all right
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.040]   that's a good
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:12.640]   question a lot of
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.420]   people ask about
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.020]   this like what
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:14.600]   is step
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   one if I want
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.280]   to get some
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.380]   sort of
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.920]   minimum
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:19.860]   effective dose
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.840]   get some
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.180]   sort of
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:21.520]   sense of
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:21.940]   organization
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.380]   out of it
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:22.700]   I thought
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.100]   about this
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:23.320]   a little
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:23.580]   bit
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.240]   here's what
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:25.460]   I would
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:25.880]   suggest
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.320]   you're
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:26.560]   completely
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.260]   disorganized
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:27.700]   at work
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.280]   and at home
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:28.520]   and you
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:28.980]   constantly feel
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:29.200]   like you're
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:29.960]   behind things
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.260]   and maybe
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:30.440]   you're in
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:30.760]   your email
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.600]   inbox a lot
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.300]   or on your
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:32.760]   text threads
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.360]   like reacting
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:33.800]   to crisis
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.180]   I think you
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:35.500]   need some
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:35.820]   sort of
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:36.520]   master list
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:36.860]   you need
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:37.360]   some place
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:37.600]   where you
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.140]   write down
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:38.580]   everything
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.420]   that is
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:40.900]   just in
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.040]   your
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:41.460]   landscape
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:41.840]   of things
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.140]   you might
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:42.480]   have some
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:42.960]   responsibility
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.820]   for or need
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.340]   to deal
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:44.520]   with
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:44.860]   this is
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.340]   probably
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.260]   step
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:46.540]   number
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:46.960]   one
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.560]   and you
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:47.900]   have to
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.460]   tend to
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:48.680]   it
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:48.880]   right
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.320]   so at
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:49.580]   the end
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:49.860]   of every
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:50.100]   day
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:50.900]   just dump
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.800]   what came
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.240]   up today
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:53.560]   that I'm
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:53.940]   just keeping
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:54.300]   track of
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:54.500]   in my
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:54.820]   head
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.460]   what text
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:55.700]   message
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.100]   that I get
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:56.320]   that I'm
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:56.520]   kind of
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:56.800]   forgetting
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.200]   about
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.640]   what is
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:58.980]   coming
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.560]   through on
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.000]   some
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:00.440]   emails
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:00.900]   and now
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:01.280]   I realize
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:01.640]   this is a
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.100]   bigger project
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:02.400]   I need
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:02.820]   to do
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.140]   just get
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:04.420]   it all
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:04.680]   written
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.080]   down
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:05.520]   somewhere
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.980]   do it
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.180]   on like
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:07.520]   a legal
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:07.980]   pad
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.760]   so you
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:08.860]   can
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.200]   carry
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:09.360]   it
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:09.540]   with
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:09.700]   you
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:09.800]   or
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.000]   maybe
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:10.160]   like

[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:11.300]   like
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:11.520]   that
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.180]   that
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:12.360]   is
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:12.540]   probably

[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:14.740]   that's
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:14.860]   sort
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:14.940]   of

[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:16.120]   right
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.740]   and he
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.340]   had
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:17.560]   this
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:17.780]   thing
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.240]   built
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:18.480]   and he
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:18.680]   built

[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.880]   I think
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.100]   this was
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:27.300]   in like

[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.680]   that was
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.140]   so big
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:35.360]   it was
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:35.600]   big

[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:45.820]   it
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:45.900]   would
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:46.000]   be
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:46.140]   like
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:46.320]   oh
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:46.580]   it's
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:46.720]   you
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:46.820]   know
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:47.480]   animations
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.000]   of
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:48.660]   the
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:48.960]   fighter
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.260]   the
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:49.740]   planes
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:50.080]   flying
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:50.260]   around
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:50.380]   the
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:50.700]   globe
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:51.040]   and
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:51.880]   yeah
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.100]   like
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:52.780]   propaganda
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:53.200]   videos
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:53.360]   like
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:53.540]   US
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:53.860]   propaganda
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:54.200]   videos
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:54.340]   which
[00:59:54.340 --> 01:00:24.320]   is
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:24.320]   not what he wanted to be working on and so I think he just kind of got depressed he got paid for that though right they got paid for it but it was just to try to keep the lights on because this is not the same as having like a hit movie so it was like they had to fire a lot of people then they had to fire a lot of labor issues right there the animators had gone on strike this might have been pre-war that really disillusioned him like he had all this disillusionment happening for years and so I think he just when you're really driven like that and you're really driven like that and you're suddenly are taken out of your life the
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.680]   things you were working on and succeeding on.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.000]   I think he just got depressed.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.900]   Disneyland took him out of it.
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.580]   He's like, we're going to build this park.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.020]   And everyone thought he was crazy.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.060]   He's like, we're going to make it happen.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.140]   And it was.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:36.780]   It was very successful.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.740]   And that was actually sort of saved Disney with these parks eventually.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.080]   They generate a lot of money, Jesse.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:41.800]   I don't know if you know this.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.880]   When you go to Disneyland, they have abundant opportunities for you to spend money.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.660]   Don't know if you know about it.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:54.680]   It's almost as if they're trying to make money off of their guests.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:01.280]   I always say, what are the two most powerful ways to make money off of people?
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.280]   A, convincing them that they might make a lot of money.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:04.920]   So that's casinos.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.540]   Or B, their kids.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.880]   I want my kids to have the right experience.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.300]   And so you write these checks.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.500]   I had an aha moment.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.680]   What else would you buy, though, other than a ticket and food and stuff?
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.740]   Souvenirs.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.580]   So this was an aha moment I had.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.580]   Not me, but actually the guy who does my hair had to figure this out, right?
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.740]   So we're in Star Wars World or whatever they call it at Disneyland.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.420]   I don't know what it's called.
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.580]   They spent a billion dollars on just like this part of the park.
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.000]   And it's all like Star Wars-y.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.240]   And we come across this thing where there's like a guy out there.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.120]   They're promoting something.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.080]   And we're like, what's going on here?
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.940]   And they're like, oh, it's a make-your-own-lightsaber experience, right?
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.420]   And they're like, oh, that sounds interesting.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.260]   And he's like, yeah.
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.200]   And you know what?
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.000]   We have some spots.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:48.640]   It's reservation.
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.480]   We have some spots.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.020]   Like, oh, yeah.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.680]   This is interesting.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.360]   Like, this could be fun.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.020]   You have spots right now.
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.300]   Great.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:52.780]   He's like, great.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.520]   So how much is it?
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.680]   He's like, it's $237 a person.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.020]   Weird number.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.440]   So we're like, well, we're not doing that, right?
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.240]   Because you had five people.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.960]   Yeah, we're not going to spend that money.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.760]   My wife's like, we're not spending $1,000 on lightsabers.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.400]   He's like, well, he's like, I'll tell you.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.660]   He's like, yeah, I get it.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:10.920]   I get it.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:16.760]   He's like, you know, at this gift shop though, you can build plastic ones and it's like $30
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.200]   a lightsaber.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.320]   Like, oh yeah, that's much better.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:19.780]   Okay, good.
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.380]   Here's the insight my hair guy had.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.800]   There's no, there was nothing behind that wall.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.000]   There was no $237 build a lightsaber thing.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.840]   The entire point of that is to get you to buy the $30 lightsabers, right?
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.700]   Because that'd be brilliant.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.300]   They're like, hey, your kids want to build lightsabers?
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.040]   Like, yeah, like it's going to be $250.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:39.900]   Like, boo.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:44.240]   And then they're like, well, I guess you could, I guess you could do this $30 experience.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.120]   Well, some people must pay the $250.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.240]   That's probably what's really happening.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.420]   But I like this idea that it was like just for, because it's a very effective way to get
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:52.980]   you to spend $30 on a lightsaber.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.340]   No, it seemed like it was, I don't want to say it.
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.740]   But some people wouldn't shake a stick.
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.220]   Some people were, I'm trying to say it nicely.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.000]   I think there were plenty of people in the Star Wars portion of the park who seemed like
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.660]   they would spend the $237.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:21.160]   And I would say they were, they're in their 20s, probably live with their parents and don't
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:21.940]   spend a lot of time in the gym.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.500]   That's like, that's probably how I describe it.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.560]   There was a certain demographic.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.020]   See, I think about it totally differently.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.520]   I think I could see like people abroad, like flying private over there and be like, all right,
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.040]   no problem.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:30.720]   Like whatever.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.300]   But are they that interested in a lightsaber?
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.220]   Probably.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.560]   If they fly there from like Japan or something.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:37.420]   Okay.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.900]   So you're like, this is nothing.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.140]   We spent so much money.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:41.520]   I get that.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.400]   We spent so much money to come here.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.200]   Like, why not just add that?
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.800]   Because you can do like private tours there.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.680]   It's $800 a day or something like that.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.480]   I mean, think about if you fly private there.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.380]   I mean, that's 50K right there.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.200]   And then you do the private tour where you spend like a thousand bucks for your party
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.580]   and you get to go to the front of every line.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.100]   So it's like a private tour.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.540]   But all it is, is they don't want to just say, if you're rich, you don't have to wait
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:09.060]   any lines.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:13.600]   So it's like, oh, we have a private tour and our tour guides are able to bypass the lines.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.400]   But all they do is just let you get on the rides right away.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.460]   So yeah, you're spending a thousand bucks a day on that anyways.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.400]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.660]   The 237 for the lightsaber.
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.820]   Whatever.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.440]   Point is, who was the original question from?
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.840]   Duncan.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.640]   Duncan.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.520]   Point is, Duncan, beware of lightsaber scams.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.740]   I think we handled that one perfectly, Jesse.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.560]   All right.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.180]   Who do we got next?
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.620]   Next up is Fred.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:43.700]   I have an internship in mainframe development with a rare and valuable skill.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.400]   Very few people have the skill set within my organization and many of them are nearing
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:47.880]   retirement.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.560]   However, it's long hours and often overlooked by management.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.300]   This fall, I have an opportunity to transition into a data analyst role for a third internship.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.600]   However, there are drawbacks as well.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.280]   How should I manage my internships?
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.880]   You know, I don't care as much about internships.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.220]   Right.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.040]   It's not your job.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.460]   So the default there would be, yeah, do the data analyst one.
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.540]   You're just gathering data.
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:10.600]   Right.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.060]   See what that's like.
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:13.280]   Maybe there's something about that you like.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.120]   Like you're gathering information with these internships.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.360]   I'm not going to overthink that.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.660]   When it comes to actually choosing what you want to do for a job after the fact, especially
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:24.860]   if these internships open up, each thing you did internship in opens up a job opportunity.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:30.600]   The question is always twofold when it comes to these career capital moves, right?
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.000]   The building up rare and valuable skills and using them to construct your career.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.600]   Is there an opportunity in this job to build career capital?
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.040]   So are there rare and valuable skills that I could develop?
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.860]   For the mainframe job that your mainframe internship could lead to, the answer seems to be clearly
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.340]   yes.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.880]   You describe it as a rare and valuable skill.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.420]   Most people don't know how to still work with these mainframes, but you need to upkeep
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:52.720]   them.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.440]   So yeah, yes.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:00.060]   The second question you have to ask is, will there be an opportunity for me to cash in career
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:05.660]   capital if acquired to gain some autonomy or control over how my career unfolds?
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.260]   That's often the sticking point.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.340]   And that's what you would really have to assess here.
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:17.200]   So if for whatever reason, this company is very rigid about people in their mainframe
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.080]   development group, no, this is just what that job is.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.820]   And the salaries are here and that's it.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:23.720]   And we don't really care.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.840]   We feel like you're expendable.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.860]   Then the answer to that second question is no.
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:27.980]   And you'd be wary about it.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.700]   If on the other hand, you're like, look, yeah, they don't realize the value of this.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:38.000]   But if I got really good at that and was like, hey, I'm keeping up 10 of these systems
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.300]   and now I want to change so that I'm doing this like remotely or I'm here once a week
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.800]   or whatever you want to do.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.840]   And they're like, oh, OK, yeah, we don't want to lose you.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:49.000]   If you think there would be a chance to apply your capital to get leverage, then I think it
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.160]   could be good whether or not they're recognizing the value right now.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:57.260]   The classic place where the second question trips up people is law partners.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:00.460]   There's an example from the book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:06.540]   In law, especially like big law, so like working at the big law firms in the big cities, you
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.560]   for sure are building up a rare and valuable skill, right?
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:14.440]   Because you are mastering a specific part of the legal code that is literally very valuable
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.180]   to clients.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.060]   And not a lot of people can do it.
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:20.640]   You're using your law degree in your brain and your ability to like really work hard to
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:20.940]   learn it.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:26.720]   You build up a huge amount of career capital in law, but at big law firms, they give you
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.700]   a very limited number of options for investing that career capital, right?
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:34.780]   Really, the only option they give you is investing it into having more salary.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:39.940]   If you get good at this, you can become a partner and then you can become a managing partner and
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.480]   what you're going to get in exchange for that is more money.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.040]   And they are very rigid about that is it.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:48.360]   If you're going to be at this firm, here is the path and here are the expectations.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:52.180]   And the only thing you can open up by getting better is moving to the next step.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.700]   And so it's a classic example of a place where, yeah, you can build up a lot of career
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:08:00.180]   capital, but they make it very hard for you to have flexibility in how you cash in that
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.900]   career capital to take control of your career.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.740]   And that's a problem.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:07.160]   And it's why a lot of lawyers end up with good bank accounts, but really unhappy because
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.280]   they got really good, but they have no choice with what to do with that except for just
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.120]   to make more money.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.840]   And for a lot of people, other parts of their ideal lifestyle are then being trampled on because
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.800]   they don't have control over it.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.460]   So you always have to get both of those questions.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:24.400]   So that is how you should evaluate the career opportunities to come out of these internships.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.540]   Can I build a rare and valuable skill?
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.380]   And will I have options if I do?
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:33.860]   And that's what you're looking for is whatever has the strongest affirmative answer to both
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:34.180]   of those.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.940]   When it comes to your internships, yeah, do the other internship, right?
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:40.000]   Like might as well open up more opportunities, learn more things.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.820]   That information is not going to hurt you.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.480]   What's going to matter is the choice you make for what job you go after.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.560]   And then once you do, once you have that job.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.340]   So that would be, that would be my advice.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:56.280]   I mean, there are some options for cashing out your law career capital, but they're hard.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.080]   You have to leave the big firms.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.320]   You have to try to do your own thing.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.320]   You have to renegotiate your situation.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.680]   I know someone, for example, who successfully renegotiated, I'm not going to, I'll leave
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.360]   the partner track and we can like keep my salary where it is.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.900]   And I'm going to do this many hours because it's billable.
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.080]   So I'm going to do this many hours.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.520]   So actually maybe the salary is going to be lower than I would be getting if I was doing
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:22.960]   80 hours a week at billables or whatever, but I'm going to live remotely.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.500]   I'm going to work remotely and live somewhere else.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:29.660]   And where I'm living, what you're paying me for this like actual 40 hours of work I'm
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.840]   doing each week is way better than what most people are being paid here for working 40 hours
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:34.200]   a week.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:34.540]   Sure.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.960]   It's not as prestigious and it's not on the track and I'm not going to make a million five,
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.940]   but it's a good salary for a reasonable amount of work.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.300]   And now I can live in this other part of the country.
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.320]   So I've seen that before.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   You've also seen people like try to put out their own shingles and then you can have some
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:48.620]   control.
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:53.580]   But law like famously is, I think it's a classic example is you build a lot of capital, but you
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.060]   only have one thing you're allowed to invest it in.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:58.740]   It's like the company store back in the old days of mining companies.
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:02.820]   Like they would pay you a good wage to be a miner, but the only thing you could do with
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.100]   it is spend it at the company store.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.520]   You had to live in the company town.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.220]   You had to live in the company housing and you had to buy from the company store and they
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:09.560]   kind of just got all that money back.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.300]   That's how I think about some of those partnership track sort of elite jobs sometimes.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.880]   All right.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:16.400]   Who else do we got?
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.780]   Next up is Joel.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:23.420]   I've noticed that much of Cal's goal setting philosophy aligns with research on goal
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:29.020]   hierarchies, top level subordinate goals down to specific goals for the current day.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.040]   Has Cal ever seen this research or explored similar evidence-based frameworks in shaping
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.220]   his approach to goal setting or behavior change?
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.180]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.100]   I find goal research to be so boring.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:43.660]   There is this research that often comes out of business schools and there's often long acronyms
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:50.080]   and like here is the whatever 17 letter long word type of goal setting paradigm and it's
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.300]   really not that interesting to me.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.320]   I don't find the research interesting.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.660]   Like you give someone a framework, you're giving them structure to their thinking and planning
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.320]   that they didn't have before and like it does better.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.640]   And like, look, this is a good framework.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:05.940]   So no, I, I kind of find that research boring, but I would say this, the type of things you're
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.820]   talking about, like multi-scale planning, et cetera.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.380]   I don't see that as goal setting.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:11.000]   I just see it as time management.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.040]   Like what is time management in the end other than making intentional decisions about what
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:16.920]   should I do next?
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:23.240]   Like that's time management and there's a particular segment of people, sort of this
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.620]   modern, like educated knowledge worker, spend a lot of time on a computer screen type people
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:34.320]   where you have this tension between bigger picture things you want to work on that are going to
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.640]   be long-term important for you and maybe for your professional prospects and the dizzying
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.760]   whirlwind of digital distractions that just sort of like makes up your day to day.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.660]   And so you have to be very intentional.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.380]   Otherwise you're just in the whirlwind and nothing gets done.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.620]   And you get stuck and you get stagnant and you're basically trying to prove your worth
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.560]   through your pseudo productivity, which is a young man's game and something that's not
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.020]   going to lead to like a sustainable life.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:59.080]   And so you need some way of making a smarter decision in the moment about what to do next
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.540]   beyond just like who wants my attention right now.
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:07.800]   And so having multiple scales of thinking about what's important helps you trickle big picture
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.160]   ideas down to small picture decisions about what to come next.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.120]   To me, this is just common sense and it works well in practice, but I don't really see it
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.280]   as goal setting so much as I see it as making smart time management.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:24.480]   decisions in a current digital work culture where it is very hard on the fly without structure
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.960]   to make smart decisions about your time.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.540]   Other people don't have this issue, right?
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.140]   I mean, if you're in a situation where you're not in a whirlwind of digital distraction workplace,
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:32.520]   it might be much easier.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.080]   If you're working on one big project, you could run like Oliver Berkman's schedule, which is
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:41.100]   basically deep work for three hours on the thing you're doing that's important to you.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.420]   And then just so like do your best with the rest of the day.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.380]   See what you're in the mood for.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.720]   Keep up with stuff that's urgent and just try not to work too much.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.360]   Like that's fine.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:53.000]   If like maybe you're a professional writer, for example, or a independent thinker or something
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:53.500]   like that.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:58.720]   But if you are trying to build career capital and find meaning and move the needle in a
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:05.840]   sort of busy knowledge work job, I just, I think time management requires some care about
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.040]   what you want to work on next.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.940]   It requires some care in terms of how do you make the decision about what's the right usage
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.340]   of my time and multiple scale seems to make sense.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.820]   So I don't know if there's a lot of research on it, but there is a lot of good experience
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.240]   of real people who have tried this.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:20.960]   All right.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   Do we have a call this week?
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.680]   We do.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:23.080]   All right.
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:23.320]   Excellent.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:23.860]   Let's hear it.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.820]   Hello, Cal.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.060]   My name is Jamie Chalmers, a long time listener, first time caller.
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.820]   I want to thank you for your books.
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:35.000]   They've been tremendously helpful in my creative career.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   I've got several different projects that run concurrently.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.180]   And I was listening to your recent episode about Inbox Zero, which I thought was fascinating.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:50.260]   In particular, the method that you use using Trello and your working memory text file
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:54.360]   to capture information out of email and plug it into your card system.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.700]   Now, I've listened to that episode and you talking about that about half a dozen times
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.760]   around my head around it.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.480]   And while I've had some success in using the working memory file to get emails out of my
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:11.900]   inbox, as it were, I've not had a lot of success in translating those into my Notion task system.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:15.520]   And so I kind of wondered whether you could just dig back into that a little bit more,
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.320]   explain some of the mechanics, perhaps the head spaces that you get into when you're
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:23.140]   focusing on translating that information into action.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:27.520]   That would be super helpful because I can see that it would be a really useful way to go
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.160]   about things.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.100]   And yeah, I'd love to find out more.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.620]   So thank you once again for everything that you do.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.820]   Massively important in my life.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:36.840]   I appreciate you.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.040]   I look forward to hearing from you.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:38.520]   Thanks.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.060]   All right, Jamie.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:40.860]   It's a good question.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:47.220]   And I think part of like the hang up here might be that I go from inbox to working memory
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:47.860]   dot TXT.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:53.460]   And then from there, there's a lot of directions where that information can go.
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.700]   Only one of which is a task system.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.080]   So like, let's do this again real briefly.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:02.040]   So the basic idea here is how do you clear an inbox, right?
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:09.220]   I don't recommend going message by message necessarily and trying to dispatch completely
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.220]   as each message before moving on to the next.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:15.060]   The context switching there becomes a real cognitive load.
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:16.280]   It becomes very exhausting.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.380]   It become, you know, the strain, everyone knows it of like, why can't I just keep going through
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:20.900]   these messages?
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.300]   Why am I so resistant to it?
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:27.640]   It's because your mind can't keep switching from one topic to another so quickly.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.800]   It's mentally really dragging on it, right?
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.160]   And so what I do is I go through my inbox.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.360]   I grab, I don't handle the message.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:42.220]   I just put a summary of like what that message demands of me into a text file.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:45.060]   Really just as fast as I can type, right?
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.780]   It doesn't have to be, you know, clean or interesting or something like that.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:52.060]   And then I have all of those in my text file.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:52.960]   I can organize them.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.680]   In fact, I was thinking what I'm going to do, Jesse, is I'm going to load up an inbox right
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.560]   now while we're talking.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:05.880]   So I can just give an example of how I'm going to read real messages from my inbox right now
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.720]   and talk about like what would be my summary in my working memory.txt file.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:10.980]   Okay.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.220]   So like I'm loading up, I have so many inboxes.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:13.580]   This is crazy.
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:19.440]   This is my personal, this is a personal inbox, an inbox that we do kind of behind the scenes
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.540]   stuff for the podcast and for like my books or whatever.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.040]   All right.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:24.920]   So I'm looking through this now.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.240]   First email is a newsletter.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.160]   So it doesn't matter.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.100]   Next one is a meeting scheduling for an appointment with a trainer.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.660]   So what would I put there?
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.100]   I would just type down schedule training.
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.260]   All right.
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:47.400]   Next one, ironically, is from a PT I used to work with checking in.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.280]   So I'd be like, get back to their name.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.380]   There's something from you, Jesse.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.740]   So I put that in ignore.
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.440]   That's immediately where that goes.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.060]   Button I press there.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:06.220]   I got a scheduling email about a club I helped run at my kid's school.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.820]   So I just put, again, get back to blah, blah, blah about whatever.
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:13.040]   I have an invoice, pay, pay invoice.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.580]   Do you delete these emails after you make the note?
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:17.980]   Yes.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.440]   So then I would be.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.680]   Do you delete, make the note?
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.300]   I don't delete.
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:22.120]   I archive.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:22.940]   Okay.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.440]   Yeah, you are.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.560]   I archive, right?
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.520]   And so there's enough information.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.540]   So when I say like, get back to blank, I put their name.
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:33.920]   So now I know I can just type that name to Gmail and that email will come back.
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.880]   Invoice to pay, pay invoice.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.780]   Okay.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.720]   Respond to.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:46.100]   It's a note from actually a well-known podcaster who I sent a note to and he got back to me.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.800]   Rogan?
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.180]   It's not Rogan.
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.280]   Yeah, he doesn't like you.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:50.840]   He doesn't like me.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:51.820]   He's like.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.200]   I'm convinced he doesn't like you.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.440]   He's like, why don't you tweet me?
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.780]   You're moved by tweet me.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.280]   Mailing list, mailing list.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.620]   Someone sending me a galley of something.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:07.640]   North, South Korea publicity thing.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.420]   Put on calendar, right?
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:10.860]   And something to schedule.
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.780]   It's a note to myself.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:16.040]   Put such and such a schedule for two o'clock on Thursday.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.960]   So that type, that's like what I'm writing.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.400]   Hold on a minute.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.380]   You emailed yourself?
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:21.000]   Because I was somewhere else.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:21.420]   Okay.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.640]   And then you're going to note that that's actually kind of funny.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.700]   Yeah, because I was, I was out and about.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.600]   Like if I'm getting my haircut and we're like, oh, let's schedule the next
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.560]   haircut while I'm here.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.420]   You had a lot going on at this hair appointment.
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:34.320]   This is a Disneyland emailing yourself.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.600]   Key of today's episode.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.580]   You would like this guy actually.
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:40.040]   It's real.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:45.440]   Anyways, I'll email myself on the fly because I know when I next leave my inbox,
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.340]   that'll move to working memory dot TXT and then I'll take care of it.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:48.540]   All right.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:49.580]   So those are the type of things I'd write.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.240]   Then you sort them by type.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.620]   Right.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:54.400]   So like a bunch of these were schedule.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.240]   I'm just going to like copy and paste.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.980]   When I say sort, I mean, I'm just copying and pasting text within a text file, plain text
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:00.220]   file.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.980]   I'm going to put like the scheduling things all in a row.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.800]   So I just have a bunch of like scheduling things like in a row.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.180]   There's like getting back to people things.
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:10.560]   I can be like, all right, getting back to people.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.440]   And I'll put those like next to each other or whatever.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:16.620]   So I'm kind of like grouping these things by, by type, by type of message.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:20.680]   Or if there's a bunch of things on the same subject matter, like if I had multiple, I did
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.420]   a lot of foreign press this week for some reason.
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.220]   So like I would have like multiple things about foreign press.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:27.060]   I'd put all those things together.
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.080]   I'm just kind of like sorting things.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:34.180]   Then I will go through and tackle these things by group.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:37.820]   And it's just easier when the groups are all the same type of thinking.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.140]   So now I have like in that list there, four or five scheduling things.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:45.800]   I'm going to open up my calendar, open up my inbox, like, all right, now we're doing
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.900]   scheduling and doing this all at once has like a lot of advantages, right?
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:55.240]   So most of those, first of all, are not going to end up on my task list.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.660]   I'm just going to go through one by one and do the scheduling.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.300]   And some of these, there's a link to a calendar.
[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:00.200]   I'll do it that way.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.020]   And other ones I email back, like, here's the time I want to suggest.
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:05.000]   I'm just handling it right there.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.320]   So I'll go back and find those again in my inbox and like respond to them as needed.
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.040]   I'm handling it right there.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.760]   But because I'm doing all this scheduling together, it allows me to have some extra
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.440]   efficiencies as well, because I might be like, man, this is going to pepper my, I don't want
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.960]   to pepper my week with these things.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.200]   All right.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.000]   You know what I'm going to do?
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:30.060]   I'm going to make like Friday afternoon, my like appointment call time next week.
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.720]   And I'm just going to offer that time to everybody.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.600]   And that way the rest of this week will stay clear, right?
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.260]   So seeing them all together, or I might say, I'm going to take these two things.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.840]   I'm going to punt them and be like, you know what?
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.760]   I don't, let's, let's get at this later in the summer.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.400]   I was like, this is feeling like there's too many things.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.820]   When I see how many things I'm scheduling, I'm like, this is too much.
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.080]   This is my, I, I'm going to punt two of these things.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:49.740]   Aren't that important.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.460]   I see it all together.
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.060]   I can make that decision more clearly.
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:52.680]   Right.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.440]   And then I'm like, let me get back to people.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.200]   And now I'm like in that mindset.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.880]   Again, those are things where I'm just responding.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:02.200]   Then some of these things will require actual putting a task, right?
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.240]   Like the, the, the South Korean publicity thing.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.800]   Oh, this is like a non-trivial amount of work I need to do here.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.540]   I'm not going to do it right now.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:12.980]   So I'm, maybe I'm going to add this to my, my Trello as a task card.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.780]   Maybe I need to actually connect this to a deadline.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.860]   So I'm going to put the deadline on the calendar.
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:22.340]   Like, this is like the drop dead deadline for getting these like answers back to this question.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:25.920]   And I'll paste the questions into a Trello card and move on from there.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.420]   So it's moving things from the inbox into hastily type lines and a working memory.txt.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:36.640]   Sorting those things manually into like groups and then dealing with those groups where I'm
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:42.020]   either ignoring them or dealing with them right away, scheduling something on my calendar or
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.940]   creating a task where the information, I'll point to the information.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:49.040]   And I still do it the old fashioned way where I just copy the subject line and put it in the
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:49.740]   Trello card.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:52.660]   So I know what to search for when I get to that task.
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.440]   And I'll be able to find it right away.
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.100]   I know people have been telling me there's ways to link directly to the message in Gmail.
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:01.180]   People keep emailing me this and I, I keep ignoring it.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.520]   But yeah, there are more advanced ways of doing it.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.300]   So hopefully that's helpful.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.200]   Does that make sense, Jesse?
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.100]   Like what I'm talking about here?
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:11.260]   It feels like an extra step, but I'm telling you, like, this is much easier mentally than
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:16.000]   if I just went from each email to each email and tried to answer it until I was done with
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:16.180]   it.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.200]   Like I'm scheduling this appointment.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.560]   Now I'm responding to someone about this.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.040]   Now I'm trying to get back to this person about this.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.200]   Now I'm scheduling an appointment.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.320]   It just becomes overwhelming and it's surprising that it does.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.140]   But underneath the covers, it's just a context switching.
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:32.800]   All right, we got a case study here.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.400]   It comes from TAF.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:41.500]   All right, TAF says, I was listening to you talk about the Thoreau schedule today and you
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:45.520]   essentially described the working schedule I've managed to carve out for myself over recent
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:45.900]   years.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:51.100]   It resulted due to a variety of factors, including COVID and having a young family.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:55.800]   I have a pretty mid-range marketing job for a CPG brand, managing a small team.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:01.520]   And my current role of current role, the career capital I've developed enables me to take ownership
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:05.620]   on my schedule because the management team knows that I will deliver strong work regardless
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.940]   of where and when I work.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:13.280]   I'll stop right there briefly to point out this is a common application of career capital.
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.540]   If you do, you have very valuable skills and you deliver, people trust you.
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.680]   You do the things you say you're going to say when you say you're going to do them.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:27.500]   You are now a super rare commodity and there will be a lot of accommodations because, oh my
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.100]   God, here's someone who actually does what they say they're going to do when they're going
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:30.500]   to do it.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.060]   Like we do not want to lose this person.
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.080]   You have a lot of control there.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.020]   So here now is the schedule that TAF created.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:40.560]   So that being said, my schedule borrows from many concepts you've discussed.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.560]   All right, so here's the schedule.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.020]   I wake at 6 a.m. and read, but not on my phone.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:50.280]   I go to my office at 7 a.m. and start my day clearing emails and checking in on core project
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.620]   timelines to make sure there's nothing urgent on the cards.
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:57.220]   I find that staring, starting at 7 a.m. means I'm working before most of my colleagues are
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.360]   logged on, which means there are very few distractions or meetings booked during this time.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.520]   And I can just focus on what I need to get done.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:07.720]   Then I have time blocked my calendar from 7.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. for my highlight.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:14.960]   This is a term that comes from the time dorks, where I focus on the one major priority deep
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.760]   work project that is most critical to my day.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:21.380]   Then at 12 p.m., having completed five hours of work, I stop and work out.
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:22.840]   I'm outside and that allows me to think.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:28.180]   And then once I come home, I cover off the last two to three hours of the day with any
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:31.320]   shallow work admin meetings and sign off at 4 p.m. to be with my family.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.140]   In the evening after my daughter has gone to bed, my wife and I read for about one to two
[01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:35.980]   hours before bed.
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:39.820]   I always have a number of books on the go, a novel, something nonfiction, something
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:43.100]   theological, and a book of poetry so that I have plenty of choice for whatever mood I'm
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:43.280]   in.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.720]   I basically read until I fall asleep, and I like the idea of reading at the very start
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.780]   and end of each day.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.820]   Some additional habits that help.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.180]   I have no social media apps on my phone.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:55.140]   I use Trello to organize my work and personal life.
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:59.320]   I have one central board with my priorities for today, which contains anything critical.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.120]   The rest fall into priority two or backlog.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.960]   Anything that sits in backlog for a long time eventually gets archived if nobody raises
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.120]   it as important.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:12.280]   I treat my Outlook as if it's an actual mailbox, so I close it once I'm finished with it and
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.000]   then go back to check it at specific intervals in the day.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.760]   I've found this reduces the impulse of reading emails as they arrive and constantly being distracted.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.780]   I also have a two-folder system for my email.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:28.240]   My inbox has incoming mail or emails I need to address, and then filed has everything else.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.920]   My reason is that once I've read an email, it can be filed, and if I need again, I can search
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.280]   for it.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:36.840]   This has reduced all email admin and a necessary folder assignment or rules.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:43.440]   Finally, I time block my work days with recurring meetings so that I'm automatically blocked off
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:50.520]   every day for my morning highlight, my lunchtime 10K run, and my time with my family at 4 p.m.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:54.320]   This means every day has the same structure, and my calendar availability is prescribed for
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.260]   anyone booking meetings.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:59.740]   I've never had any issues or pushback from colleagues with this approach, and people rarely book meetings
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:00.840]   across my time blocks.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.100]   So there we go.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:10.100]   Someone that it's not a sexy story of, I became the only nuclear physicist in the world that
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:13.280]   could handle this, and therefore I have a job where I work one day a week and surf all day.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.940]   It's not a sexy story like that.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.760]   It's just someone who does their job very well.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:17.340]   They deliver.
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.040]   They're reliable.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.020]   They do high quality.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.320]   They combine this with lifestyle-centric planning or lifestyle engineering or lifestyle architecting,
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.960]   whatever we want to call it, to work backwards from their ideal lifestyle, and it's not something
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.500]   that would catch your attention if you hear it described, but it is a really good lifestyle.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:36.700]   Reading in the morning, done at work at 4, doing a long run and workout in the middle of the
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:44.800]   day, get stuff done, deep work every day, meetings are constrained, email checks are not all the
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:49.040]   time, people are okay with it because they deliver, and the life is really good.
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:52.740]   So I think that is a really good example.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.620]   I appreciate to have you sending in that case study.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.840]   All right, so we have a good final segment coming up here.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.780]   We got some Cal Network artwork and a what I'm not reading segment to get into as well, but
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:07.220]   first let's take a quick break to hear from some sponsors.
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:10.120]   Jesse, I have a question for you.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:17.040]   How many people do you think stopped me when I was at Disneyland recently to compliment how
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.440]   good my shave looked?
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:19.560]   Three.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.040]   It was 1,700 people.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.300]   All right.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:26.060]   Now, whether or not that's actually true, I will say I have been enjoying shaving more
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:30.000]   recently because I have been using Harry's.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.560]   Harry sends the best quality razors right to your door for a fraction of the price of the
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.160]   big brands.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:40.480]   We're talking about really good German engineered blades, these nice, comfortable sort of rubber
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.360]   coated handles.
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:46.620]   I really like them, but also shaving products and get like excellent shaving cream delivered
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:47.960]   right with your razors.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:54.700]   One I like is that you can also get a richly lathering skin softening body wash in scents
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:57.520]   like Redwood, Wildlands, and Stone.
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:02.600]   Interestingly, Jesse, richly lathering skin softening is how a lot of people describe
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.520]   this podcast.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.560]   So there you go.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.240]   They send this all to your door.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:06.840]   It's automatic.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.440]   You set it up so you don't have to remember to go to the store.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.600]   You don't have to add another task to your to-do list.
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:17.800]   Before I started using Harry's, I was basically in the Stone Age when it came to shaving.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.140]   I might as well have been scraping my face with a piece of sharpened flint.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.400]   Take your own grooming out of the Stone Age.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.020]   Get Harry's.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:33.180]   Normally their trial set is $10, but right now you can get it for just $6 if you go to
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:34.880]   harrys.com slash deep.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:42.380]   That's our exclusive link, harrys.com slash deep to get a $6 trial set.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.660]   I also want to talk about our friends at ShipStation.
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:51.280]   If you ask Jesse where all of these packages he orders from e-commerce stores come from,
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.500]   he will say, and this is absolutely true, Jesse, you can back me up on this, a stork delivers
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:55.760]   them.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.000]   He told me this just earlier today.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:58.940]   He thinks that's how they come.
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:03.200]   But for those of you who actually run an e-commerce store, you know packages don't arrive
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:03.780]   by magic.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.220]   For a lot of companies, it is a huge source of labor and stress.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:12.900]   This is where ShipStation can make your life so much easier.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:20.760]   Last year alone, over 700 million orders were fulfilled with ShipStation, half of which were
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.520]   creatine shipments going to Jesse.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:26.900]   With ShipStation, you can sync orders from everywhere you sell into one dashboard.
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:27.720]   This is key.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:32.460]   You have one dashboard and you can replace manual tasks with custom automations to reduce shipping
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:32.800]   errors.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:37.200]   And all of this is at the fraction of the cost you probably were already spending for
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:37.640]   fulfillment.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.520]   Now, here's a couple of things about ShipStation that caught my attention.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.340]   It's the fastest, most affordable way to ship products to your customers because it has
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:53.460]   discounts up to 88% off UPS, DHL Express, and USPS rates and up to 90% off FedEx rates.
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:30:07.140]   It also seamlessly integrates with the services and selling channels you are already using so you can manage all of your orders over multiple different channels and systems in one easy-to-see dashboard.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:08.920]   All right, you want to hear something cool?
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:18.620]   During the time I've been reading this spot, 1,400 packages were shipped with the help of ShipStation and none of them, Jesse, were delivered by a store.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.020]   Come on.
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:21.840]   Upgrade to a smoother shipping experience.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.680]   Go to ShipStation.com slash deep to sign up for your free trial.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:29.820]   No credit card or contract is required and you can cancel any time.
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.580]   That's ShipStation.com slash deep.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:36.100]   All right, let's get back to our show.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:43.560]   All right, so in our final segment, I want to do a twist on my what I'm reading segment that's called what I'm not reading.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:50.160]   But first, Jesse, I wanted to quickly cover a new piece of Cal Network artwork that came in.
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:56.780]   I do have to sort of ding this person a little bit because a lot of people have been making sort of like custom artwork.
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:06.060]   In this case, they just took an existing photo of me and added to the existing photo a copy of a fake Cal Network book, but I still think it is interesting.
[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:06.720]   So here we go.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.420]   We'll put it on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:15.000]   And what we've got here is a – this is my author photo actually.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:15.780]   I don't know if you've seen it.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:16.800]   It's what's on my book jacket.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.260]   Cal Network with his Georgetown tank top.
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:21.780]   That's what I wear to teach.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:34.400]   Veining Out, as I constantly do, with Austin Aviator Sunglasses, holding Cal Network's hit bestselling book, I'm the Boss Now, which is his career advice book.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:34.880]   So there we go.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:39.060]   It's my author photo with a mocked-up book.
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:42.560]   So I always appreciate some good Cal Network artwork.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.340]   All right.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:54.240]   So to our final segment, I have been doing recently what I'm reading where I talk about like interesting articles and books that either cover interesting ideas you might like or I think are just good books or articles for those looking for some more depth.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.560]   I want to rant briefly here today.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.620]   I'm going to call this segment what I'm not reading.
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:07.360]   It's a particular type of article that's been common recently, and I want to give you permission to ignore every single one of them because they're nonsense and are going to cause unnecessary stress.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:13.260]   I have loaded here a sample of one of these type of articles that I'm going to suggest you don't read.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:17.620]   I'll put it on the screen here for those who are listening instead of – or watching instead of just listening.
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:22.180]   The article is from Fortune, and here's the headline.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:31.120]   OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says AI can rival someone with a PhD just weeks after saying it's ready for entry-level jobs.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.760]   So what's left for grads?
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.480]   This came out on June 20th.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:42.460]   This is an article – I saw this because like Google Notification just showed it to me on my phone.
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:51.740]   There are a lot of articles like this where there is some sort of over-the-top alarmist headline which makes anyone who's just loosely following AI be like, oh, my God, we're so screwed.
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:58.140]   But I want to look a little bit deeper at this article to try to explain why you can ignore this type of thing.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.060]   All right.
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:02.380]   So if we read this article, I have a couple quotes here.
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.200]   Here's the first paragraph.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:12.880]   Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that the technology can already perform the task equal to that of an entry-level employee.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:23.180]   Now on a podcast posted just last week, the chat GPD mastermind went even further saying AI can even perform tasks typically expected of the smartest grads with a doctorate.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:36.860]   Soon after, it says, as companies like Amazon have admitted, they will soon cut their corporate ranks thanks to AI and Anthropic CEO Dario Amadei warning that the technology could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:43.480]   It begs the question, what jobs will be left for those tossing their graduation caps into the air in the coming years?
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:52.640]   There are a lot of articles like this where tech CEOs are saying pearl-clutching, groin-tightening, scary type of things like this.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:55.120]   This is all nonsense.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.400]   And let me try to explain to you why.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.340]   Okay.
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:07.380]   First of all, let's start with the claim here that, and I'm going to read this, AI can perform tasks typically expected to the smartest grads with a doctorate.
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:09.640]   What are they actually talking about here?
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:20.060]   What they're actually talking about here is the fact that OpenAI carefully tuned one of their foundational models to work on a specific type of math competition question.
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:25.060]   So they hired, we got some correction on this from a listener.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:35.940]   They used a data set from a company that hired math PhDs and paid them $100 an hour to write math problems of this type with step-by-step solutions.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:43.300]   And then they could use reinforcement learning techniques to try to tune one of these foundation models to do well on this very specific type of math problem.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:52.340]   A professor involved in this project said, oh, these are hard math problems, not the type you would assign an undergrad, but the type you might assign a graduate student.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:58.320]   From there, we get AI can now do PhD-level workers' jobs.
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:14.480]   That is a nonsense leap from a very specific type of math competition problem that is like of the type that might get assigned in a graduate student problem set to AI is doing graduate-level jobs.
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:22.800]   And not only is it a huge exaggeration, but as we went over in the What I'm Reading segment a few weeks ago,
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:29.120]   even those results are highly contested because OpenAI was like, look, these are hard problems and we can do them.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:37.020]   And independent research firms said, great, let's take these models and we'll put them on other similar math competitions that happened recently.
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:48.540]   And they did terribly, leading to the idea that they had been very, very fit to this very specific type of problem that happened to be really well suited for the reinforcement learning techniques that we know how to use now on AI.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.840]   So that is a massive exaggeration.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:36:01.640]   Another massive exaggeration that's happening with a lot of this reporting is conflating of the post-pandemic tech downturn, which is leading to lots of layoffs.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:07.280]   It's getting a little bit better now, but it's leading to lots of layoffs because there was a huge boom in the tech industry during the pandemic.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.100]   And post-pandemic, we're cyclical.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.340]   It's a hard job market there.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:13.280]   Companies are cutting back.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.660]   We put a lot of money into a lot of these areas.
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:21.680]   We need to cut back because we need our profit ratios to be higher for the stock market.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.780]   And just what happens?
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:23.640]   Companies are cyclical.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.360]   So there's a cutback.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:39.580]   And there's a lot of this sort of disingenuous conflating by these reporters that make it seem like, without maybe necessarily 100% claiming it, that these job losses are because AI is automating the jobs.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.780]   This is nonsense.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.560]   It is not what is happening.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:46.500]   Yes, Amazon is cutting.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.020]   Meta cut a bunch of people.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:49.760]   Microsoft is cutting a bunch of people.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.560]   Why?
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.720]   Because they're bloated.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:55.240]   They cut those revenue numbers.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.380]   They cut those employment.
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.120]   Those are expenditure numbers go down.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.200]   Their profitability goes up.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.320]   They got too big.
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:07.220]   They are not replacing hundreds of thousands of people or tens of thousands of people with AI that's automating them.
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:08.800]   AI cannot do that yet.
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.440]   So I think that is very disingenuous.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:15.960]   I saw an article the other day that said, look, CS majors are cratering.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.720]   They're going down.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.160]   And it's because AI is taking all the jobs.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.540]   It's like, hold on a second.
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:25.000]   CS majors are down because the tech industry is down.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:28.700]   The same thing happens every time the tech industry goes down.
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:33.720]   When I was a computer science undergraduate, we had the same issue.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.380]   Post .com bust in early 2001, the tech industry contracted.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:43.160]   Majors went down because there was less jobs.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:48.520]   And then majors went back up again when there was the Web 2 boom, brought a lot more investment in.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.400]   There's more jobs again.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.580]   There's a contraction post-pandemic.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:58.280]   Jobs, it made jobs for, except for, you know, specialized AI jobs, like if you're a machine learning person, are contracting some.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.200]   So majors go down.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:03.160]   And yet people will conflate it and say, oh, it's because AI is taking the jobs.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.920]   AI is not replacing software developers.
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.780]   Most of the cuts at these companies are not software developer jobs.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:14.640]   So I think it's really disingenuous reporting, but there's a lot of this going on.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:18.560]   Later in the article, we see some of this evidence.
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:26.100]   So here they say, for example, they do note, well, okay, however, I'm reading from the article now later in the article.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:32.700]   However, in the tech industry in particular, volatility in the jobs market is nothing new, said Art Zale, CEO of the tech career platform DICE.
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:39.740]   After all, nearly 600,000 tech employees lost their jobs between 2022 and 2024, according to layoffs at FOII.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:43.320]   Yes, the tech industry has really post-pandemic contracted.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.500]   So yes, there's a lot of job cuts.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:51.320]   That's not because in 2022, before ChatGPT was out, AI was taking those jobs.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:56.180]   It contracted, and then it will grow again once more investment capital comes back in.
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:03.800]   Look at like Dario Amadei saying technology could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within like two years, whatever he said.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.120]   All right, here's the reality.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.640]   It's not going to do it, and he's just blowing hot air.
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:15.860]   And Sam Altman knows that AI is not taking PhD-level jobs because it's not really taking any jobs right now.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:17.300]   They're blowing hot air.
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:18.820]   Why are they blowing hot air?
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:25.620]   Because it requires a massive amount of investment capital, ongoing investment capital, to keep these places afloat.
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:35.720]   OpenAI is desperately in need of this massive loan from SoftBank, this huge, many, many billion-dollar loan, which is happening in tranches, to go through.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:38.540]   And they need excitement around their tools.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:47.480]   And the more you feel like these tools are going to, in the future, be immensely disruptive, the more you overlook right now that they're losing $3 to $4 billion a year.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:40:07.880]   So it is in the interest of the CEOs of tech companies to push any possible narrative of very large world-shaking disruption because you will overlook any issues with their business right now if you think where they're going is going to be the biggest disruption that we've had sort of like in the history of humanity.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:13.900]   So they are now just spewing anything they can get attention for because they know they will get articles like this.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:24.320]   They know they can look at a model fine-tuned to do well on math problems, but not really because when other people tested it, it didn't, and say, well, now even PhD-level jobs are gone.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:35.580]   That is a nonsense leap, just like it was a nonsense leap when Sam Altman talked about how AI was going to help us build Dyson spheres around the sun, the power, the growth of the universe.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:52.240]   Just like it was a massive leap when Scott Alexander very confidently says in Project 2027 of like, well, yeah, I mean, pretty soon the AI is not only going to be able to program its own super intelligences, it's going to build self-replicating robots that will build the data centers, and this will all happen in the next three years.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:41:06.320]   So anyways, I wanted to do a little bit of a rant and say, you can feel confident right now when you see like these like super alarmist headlines that don't reflect anything you've seen in your own life or your own industry, your own career.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:10.120]   All these jobs are gone, and it's quoting some sort of tech CEO.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.800]   You can essentially ignore those for now.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:20.260]   Follow the more like tech reporting, tech journalism, but also just wait to actually see major changes in your own world.
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:39.580]   I think the hype coming out of these CEOs is becoming almost like parody, and this has now entered my list of what I'm not reading, is alarmist articles about whatever the latest chaos, crazy, nonsensical hot air thing that Sam Altman has said, and will be widely repeated by outlets looking to get people to click.
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:40.300]   All right, there we go.
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.140]   That's my rant, Jesse.
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.160]   Wait, so do you have notifications on your phone?
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.060]   I don't know what I, okay, let me rant about this.
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:52.340]   So you have to have this Google app on your phone.
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:42:02.240]   They force you to have it for, I had to get it because I can't, couldn't like consistently log in the Gmail.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.220]   You have to have this Google app.
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:05.520]   It's this, so you have an Android.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.140]   No, I have, it's iPhone.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:07.880]   Oh, you have an iPhone.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.020]   So something about like the two-factor authentication.
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:14.360]   You have to have the Google app, the use like Google things.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:19.280]   And so that app just like shows me, I don't know, notifications, I guess.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.160]   Like it just will pop up, like these articles will pop up in like little bars on my iPhone.
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.300]   But I can't get rid of the Google app because then I can't use my email.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:28.740]   Can you turn off the notifications?
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:29.440]   I don't know.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.020]   Is that something I can do?
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.420]   I don't.
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.800]   It cracks me up.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:35.580]   I have no idea.
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:36.320]   Let's see here.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.080]   I don't know, probably.
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:45.360]   But anyways, because I read a lot of AI content in my job as like a tech, when I do tech journalism, it's always showing me these nonsense articles.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:58.380]   It's always like Dario Amadei says, you have 17 minutes left to live before AI driven robots harvest your brains for their, to lubricate their self-replicating robot machines.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.920]   It's just like these type of headlines again and again and again.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:04.220]   So I see a lot of this nonsense and it's what I am not reading.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:10.320]   Because again, every time you look at it, it's like some super exaggerated claim like here, or they just make it up.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:14.140]   Amadei is just like half the jobs will be gone next year.
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.520]   And the reporter's like, oh, that sounds bad.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.500]   Let me get a headline about that.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:17.480]   That would be really bad, right?
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.140]   It's great.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:19.620]   It's crazy.
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.320]   And you're like, well, how is that going to happen?
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:21.860]   I don't know.
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.200]   Key unlocks.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:23.920]   It's going to happen.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:24.360]   I don't know.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:25.700]   I could write these articles.
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:35.280]   I should just do reports like as the deep media LLC head and be like, we're going to be able to fly robotic pterodactyls next month.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:36.560]   All right.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.020]   Why not?
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.560]   Like that would be a big deal.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:45.580]   Bees with lasers are going to start murdering our dogs within by 2028.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.060]   Sure.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:47.500]   Right.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:48.140]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:49.400]   It's possible.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.380]   Lasers exist.
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:52.920]   Bees exist.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:59.760]   There's someone, there's the RoboBee project that, you know, happened at Harvard 20 years ago.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.600]   It's possible.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:08.160]   I sometimes feel like this is what, there's so much interesting stuff happening with AI and so much particular impacts and good stuff and bad stuff.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.120]   There's so much serious reporting happening that I hate that all this junk is getting out there.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.540]   I mean, the robot bee thing is true, so be careful about that.
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:16.160]   All right.
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:17.340]   That's all the time we have for today.
[01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:20.380]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the podcast.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:23.100]   And until then, as always, stay tuned.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.200]   All right.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:40.220]   Well, if you're looking for a counterbalance to my rant against Sam Altman's claims about AI, check out episode 349, where I actually look at an earlier in his career, Sam Altman's productivity techniques, where I think there's actually a lot of good ideas there.
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:44.000]   So, you can't deny this guy was successful, even if we don't trust what he's saying now.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.040]   Check out that episode about how he got there.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.460]   I think you might like it.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:45:01.000]   So, as someone who writes and talks a lot about producing meaningful stuff in a distracted world, I always get excited when prominent individuals give us insight into their own processes for achieving this goal.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:15.180]   So, you can imagine how happy I was when I saw Tim Ferriss recently linked to a blog post that was titled simply Productivity that was published in 2018 by OpenAI's Sam Altman.
