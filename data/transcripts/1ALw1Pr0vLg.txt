[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.320]   - A long time listener to the podcast writes and asks this,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.840]   Pastor John, how can I trust the Bible
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.460]   if there have been so many add-ins,
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.360]   such as Mark chapter 16, verses nine to 20,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.960]   and John chapter seven, verse 53, to chapter eight,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.040]   verse 11, and of course, first John five,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.200]   verses seven and eight.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.920]   If these verses have been added into the Bible
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.440]   and should not have been,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.000]   how do we know that other things
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.860]   have not been added into the Bible as well?
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.840]   - The answer precisely to the question as it's posed
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.220]   is that we use the same criteria
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.320]   to know about other passages
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.320]   that we used to know that these three texts were additions.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.980]   In other words, if there is a science
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.440]   that can spot these three texts that he mentioned
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.880]   as not part of the original biblical manuscripts,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.520]   then that same science, in the same way,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.060]   can perform the same function for all the other passages.
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.680]   There's the answer.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.640]   Now, let's step back and paint the larger picture.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.640]   The Bible was written in Hebrew and Greek
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300]   centuries before the printing press, right?
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.200]   Printing press invented about 1450 AD.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.200]   First original language biblical manuscript printed 1516.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.280]   That means that these handwritten documents
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.440]   called manuscripts were handed down
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.020]   for by human copying for centuries.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.460]   And the question really is,
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.460]   do we have today the same Greek and Hebrew text
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.100]   in front of us to translate into English
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.300]   or whatever language or to read in Greek and Hebrew?
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.140]   Do we have the same text that corresponds
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.500]   essentially with the original documents
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.460]   that God inspired when they wrote them down?
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.540]   Now, the science of textual criticism,
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.540]   there's the phrase, textual criticism.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.500]   That's what this branch of scholarship is called.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.500]   That science is devoted to answer that question.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.400]   It specializes in comparing thousands
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.040]   of Greek and Hebrew manuscripts
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.580]   and deducing from those comparisons
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.660]   where there are differences between two or more, dozens,
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.740]   and which reading, where there are differences,
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.740]   which reading is the more likely to be original,
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.740]   which one is original.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.740]   Now, here's the reason we may have strong confidence
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.260]   that the science of textual criticism is successful
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.060]   in discerning the original wording of the manuscripts.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.060]   There are over 5,800 Greek manuscripts.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.340]   Just leave aside the Old Testament for a moment
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.340]   and just think Greek.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.100]   5,800 Greek manuscripts,
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.380]   either whole New Testament books or fragments.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.540]   This is incredible, incredible,
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.220]   if you know your manuscript history.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.260]   In other words, when the text critics sit down
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.540]   to do their work, they are not comparing
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.580]   three or four or 50 manuscripts
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.980]   which might leave us wondering
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.860]   what the original wording was.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.540]   They have thousands of texts from different places
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.540]   in different times that function as confirmations
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.720]   of what the original wording was.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.940]   So here's the way Daniel Wallace,
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.860]   who's a very prominent text critic, puts it.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.180]   This is a quote now.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.940]   "New Testament scholars face an embarrassment of riches
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.380]   "compared to the data of classical Greek
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.020]   "and Latin scholars have to contend with.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   "The average classical author's literary remains
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.420]   "number no more than 20 copies.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.280]   "We have more than 1,000 times the manuscript data
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.120]   "for the New Testament than we do
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.500]   "for the average Graeco-Roman author.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.300]   "Not only this, but the extant manuscripts
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.660]   "of the average classical author
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.820]   "are no earlier than 500 years after the time he wrote,
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.380]   "but for the New Testament, we wait a mere decades
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.620]   "for surviving copies."
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.620]   But here's the real clincher,
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.580]   and this I think is the bottom line answer to the question.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.580]   Even where there remains some uncertainty
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.100]   about which wording in a particular text,
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.820]   which wording is original and which is not,
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.300]   those places don't have, and they're very few,
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.180]   they don't have any effect on the essential truths
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.120]   of the Christian message.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.660]   So listen to Paul Wegner, and I would recommend his book.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.620]   It's called "A Student's Guide
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.660]   "to Textual Criticism of the Bible,"
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.100]   and here's what he said.
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.700]   "It is important to keep in perspective
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.700]   "the fact that only a very small part of the text
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.340]   "is in question, approximately 10% of the Old Testament,
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.900]   "7% of the New Testament, and of these,
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.140]   "most variants make little difference
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.020]   "to the meaning of any passage."
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.460]   And Daniel Wallace, who has debated Bart Ehrman,
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.420]   who is quite skeptical about the reliability
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.220]   of the New Testament, he's debated him,
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.640]   and here's what he says.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.600]   "For more than two centuries,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.060]   "biblical scholars have declared
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.060]   "that no essential affirmation of Christian doctrine
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.120]   "has been affected by the variants.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.520]   "Even Ehrman," he says, "has conceded this point
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.500]   "in three debates that I have had with him."
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.260]   And so Don Carson sums it up like this.
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.300]   "What is at stake is a purity of text
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.120]   "of such a substantial nature
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.060]   "that nothing we believe to be doctrinally true
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.720]   "and nothing we are commanded to do
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   "is in any way jeopardized by the variants."
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.700]   So the real question becomes then,
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.820]   and here's where I would leave us,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.160]   the real question becomes not do we have
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.660]   the original words of the biblical authors.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.220]   Virtually all of us agree that we do
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.780]   with the variants that we're not sure about
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.600]   affecting no manner of doctrine or ethics.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.660]   The question now is do you see
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.660]   the peculiar glory of God shining through those words
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.020]   and confirming to your own mind and heart
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.020]   that these are the very words of God?
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.320]   That's the crucial question.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.960]   - Yeah, that is crucial, the most pressing question
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.000]   for every Bible reader.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   And speaking of peculiar glory,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.100]   Pastor John recently published a book by that title,
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.160]   and the quotes referenced in this episode
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.660]   are all taken from chapter four of that book,
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.500]   a chapter titled,
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.720]   "Do We Have the Very Words of the Biblical Authors?"
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.200]   And to get that chapter, download the entire book,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.280]   "A Peculiar Glory," in full, free of charge,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.480]   at desiringgod.org/books.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.880]   Well, how can we not waste our lives?
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.800]   Tomorrow, Pastor John is gonna point our attention
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.680]   to Proverbs chapter three, verses five and six,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.220]   in search of the answer to that vital question
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.560]   that we cannot ignore.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.660]   How do we not waste our lives?
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.320]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.480]   (upbeat music)
