[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   To go to seminary or not, here's today's question.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.480]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.040]   My name is Brandon, a 23-year-old college student from Georgia.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.680]   I have felt a call to ministry and discussed it with the leaders of my home church, to
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.680]   which they have affirmed and given me the opportunity to serve in youth ministry and
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.460]   preach on occasion.
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.760]   The issue I'm facing is that I feel the urgency to be involved with ministry full-time and
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.520]   to reach out to adults and to the community.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.740]   I know I'm called to pastor, but with this urgency, I can't help but want to skip seminary.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.000]   Ministry means everything to me, and I know that seminary will help equip me with my ministry,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.560]   but I feel pressed to jump into the work now.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.840]   Additionally, I have this growing sense that we are not only in the last hour of the end
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.600]   times, but that we are in the last minutes and that Jesus is soon to return, hopefully
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.580]   within my lifetime.
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.920]   Is my sense of urgency wrongly placed?
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:10.600]   Brandon, I think your sense of urgency is God-given and valuable, and I hope you don't
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.200]   lose it.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.680]   That is, the massive and eternal realities are at stake that you see, and that's true.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.960]   And at every moment in people's lives, they could perish.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.000]   They could slip into eternity at any minute.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.900]   Everybody we know, we should feel a sense of urgency about.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.920]   And Jesus could come and wrap things up historically in your lifetime, even my lifetime.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920]   I would love it.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.040]   Oh, I would love it.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.020]   Far too many Christians, including pastors, have lost their sense of urgency.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.360]   They have settled in to a kind of routine that doesn't feel the sense of urgency of
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.300]   the danger that people are in.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.100]   So, I'm glad you feel it.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   Now, let me make four or five observations that might shape the way you channel this
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.660]   sense of urgency.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.260]   A couple of my own experiences might be helpful, and then a couple of Bible references.
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.100]   It is almost certain that I will see Jesus within 20 years face to face.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.780]   That would put me at 93.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.840]   I do not expect to live till 93.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.860]   My father died at 88.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.360]   That would be 14, 15, 15 more years for me.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.240]   So I feel a sense of urgency not to waste my life.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.300]   So it's not just a matter of what kind of education to get at the front end of your
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.300]   life.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.300]   Right.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.720]   But at every point in your life, you're going to feel this.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.180]   Every chapter, you're going to feel this.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.900]   And you're going to look at the possibilities of what you should do with your life when
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.140]   you're 30 and 40 and 50 and 60 and 70 and maybe 80.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.680]   And you're going to struggle with the precious days that are left and how to use them best.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.160]   So that's the first observation.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.160]   I'm with you.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.180]   In other words, I'm not looking from out here saying, "Whoa, you got a problem, and I'm
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.280]   trying to help you solve it."
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.720]   I got a problem.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.220]   Second, as I look back over 73 years, I have zero regrets, no regrets whatsoever that I
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.280]   stayed in school until I was 28 years old.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.320]   That's all I did was go to school from age six to 28.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.200]   I dropped out of kindergarten.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.360]   I started at six.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.960]   My mother tried to get me to go at five.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.520]   I hated it, so she didn't make it.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.480]   Back in those days, you could do that.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.260]   That is, I got my final terminal degree of education, formal education.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.060]   And it made sense that I should go as long as I could, get that, because everybody that
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.760]   I trusted was saying, "Go ahead, finish your last degree, and then all the doors that God
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.840]   might call you through will be open."
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:24.640]   So if you got a willing wife and the Lord provides the resources, I would go ahead and
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.080]   get all the education available to you that your heart would let you get.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.280]   I don't regret that.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.800]   And I was just talking with somebody last night, I'm going to add this note here, who
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:46.640]   is going back to school at like age 60 from the mission field because he feels lax.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.520]   And so it may be that we're somewhere along the way, if you do plunge into ministry at
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.920]   age 19, and you go try to plant a church in some unreached people, maybe 10 years later,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.400]   you're going to say, "Okay, okay, I'm going back to school.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.760]   That's okay if you want to do it that way."
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.840]   But I'm saying from my standpoint, I never regretted getting all the education I could.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.500]   And you are going to be handling the precious, probably the precious Word of God.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.840]   And if you want doctors to get a good education so that when they do surgery on you, they
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.040]   don't kill you, you better know how to handle the Word of God so you don't kill people with
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.220]   it.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.920]   So I know that from the standpoint of being 23 years old, getting more education can feel
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.760]   laborious.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.880]   When I was in seminary, there was a great deal of urgency among the students in the
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.260]   late 60s.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.400]   They thought they should be out marching the streets and doing more important things and
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.600]   sitting in seminary classes.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.480]   And Professor Bromley, the church history professor, stood up in chapel one day and
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.680]   announced his text for his sermon, I'll never forget it, Luke 3.23.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.040]   And he read it, "Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about 30 years of age."
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.240]   And he preached for 30 minutes on why we should stop wanting to leave seminary and do stuff
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.960]   right away.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.540]   He urged us to be patient.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:24.420]   And there are reasons why church leaders are called elders, not youngsters.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.340]   I remember thinking from that day on, I was 25 at the time, no, not quite, between, I
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.180]   don't remember, somewhere between 22 and 25, he preached that sermon.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.500]   And I remember my goal, as soon as he preached that sermon, I would like to be done with
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.520]   my schooling and invested in a fruitful ministry by the time I'm 30.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.460]   And I beat it by a year and a half, which I was very pleased by.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.780]   God was good to Noel and me.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.340]   So here, one more thing, maybe a couple of texts to consider.
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.400]   2 Peter 3, 8 and 9.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.620]   This is Peter's response to those who said that the second coming is not going to happen
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.420]   because so much time has passed.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.740]   It's not, it's just a myth anyway.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.060]   And here's what he says.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:14.300]   Don't overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.260]   and a thousand years is as one day.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.500]   The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.740]   you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.260]   Now, I think that implies several things for you, Brandon.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:40.940]   First, whether the Lord comes, comes back within your lifetime or not, when he comes
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:47.740]   and he will come, it will have been short in God's reckoning.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.900]   Second, it has been 2000 years and God has made no mistake.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.140]   None.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.860]   This was the plan.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:04.940]   The day is fixed by the authority of God, says so in Acts 1.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.220]   When the Lord comes, it will be the perfect timing.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:17.300]   As we look back over the last 2000 years, are we not glad that hundreds of godly men
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:24.900]   and women devoted themselves to serious study that they might write things that for us have
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.900]   proved absolutely life-changing?
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:33.260]   So you can see the point I'm making is that I'm glad that the sense of urgency, say, that
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:41.220]   Jonathan Edwards felt or that Luther felt or Calvin felt or Spurgeon felt did not cause
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.080]   them to just go out and knock on every door and not write sermons and not write books
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.700]   that would have proved life-changing for me and motivating for me and urgency-creating
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.180]   for me.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:01.580]   One last biblical testimony, Paul's words as an old man, 2 Timothy 4.6, "I am already
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.260]   being poured out as a drink offering.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.580]   The time for my departure has come.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.940]   I have fought the good fight.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.980]   I've finished the race.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.220]   I've kept the faith.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.900]   Henceforth, there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:21.020]   judge will award to me on that day and not only to me, but to all who've loved his appearing."
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:28.860]   Now, this is what, Brandon, this is what you want to be able to say when you come to die.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:35.580]   If it's long or short, so you live 80 years or you live to be 25, you want to be able
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:43.460]   to say, "Fought the good fight, finished the race appointed for me, kept the faith."
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.780]   God has a race for you, a race course.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.300]   It's a marathon.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.580]   It's not a sprint.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.940]   And he has one for all of us.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.140]   Ultimately, whether you go to seminary or not is not the main issue.
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:05.100]   The main issue is, will you run the course with all your might faithfully to the end?
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.100]   It is a marathon.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.780]   You need to pace yourself.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:16.180]   Find your pace, find your gifts, give yourself to lifelong growth in grace and knowledge
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.020]   and serve the Lord till he comes or till he calls.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.820]   Amen to all that.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.420]   But what's your beef with kindergarten?
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.020]   Well, they made you take naps, number one.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.020]   Good night.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.020]   I'm five years old.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.380]   Do you think I'm going to take a nap?
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.940]   I mean, we had to take a mat to school, a mat with a little blanket.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.100]   And at a point in the day, everybody rolls out their mats and lies down.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:48.020]   I'm squirreling around under that blanket saying, "I want to go home."
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.980]   And the second reason is because Sonny Paul, my neighbor, was home and he was having fun
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.340]   digging in the dirt with his trucks.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.420]   I wanted to go dig in the dirt.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:04.140]   We had a lot across the street and we dug roads and drove our trucks on the side of
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.140]   the hill there.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.420]   And oh my goodness, I think five-year-olds are supposed to be out learning stuff by digging
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:17.260]   in the dirt, not lying under blankets at kindergarten.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.820]   You heard it here first, folks.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:27.420]   And for more about this podcast, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.220]   And speaking of children, should we have them?
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:35.540]   I opened Twitter today to see this headline from the Washington Post, "Deciding whether
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.020]   to have kids has never been more complex.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.060]   Enter parenthood indecision therapists."
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.620]   Now, I'm not sure the question is more complex than it was 100 years ago when the infant
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.540]   mortality rate was 24% in this country.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.500]   Nevertheless, having children is a huge decision for sure.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.660]   And it comes with some really complex implications, especially when you factor in this profound
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:04.980]   reality, that every child we bring into this world is an eternal being who will live forever.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:10.220]   And if there's a chance that they would be unsaved, isn't it better to not have children
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.220]   at all?
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.460]   Wow, that's a big question.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.460]   That's on Friday.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.860]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.360]   [END]
