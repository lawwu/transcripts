[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Cool. So I don't really have formal slides because most of the demo is going to be on the actual
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.040]   website. But first, just a little bit about me. My background is actually in health and medicine.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.040]   And Lucas did a perfect intro. And I did a little bit of NLP at Apple for about three years.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.800]   And then more recently, I was the machine learning lead at an oncology-based company. So
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.680]   background, everything is in health. But I love keeping up with machine learning and always
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.280]   tinkering with different aspects, whether it's NLP or computer vision. And a couple months ago,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.680]   I was helping a few folks and we were trying to build something together. And there was something
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.840]   that we saw on Twitter or Reddit a while ago, and we just had the hardest time trying to find it.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.960]   And I was pretty unhappy with the fact that really great content posted on Twitter or Reddit
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.120]   goes completely unorganized. And it's not archived in any meaningful way for someone
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.640]   to discover it later on. It's really great for in the moment discovery. But if you want to find it
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.760]   later, or you happen to not bookmark it or like it, it's kind of lost. And there's also a lot of
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.840]   content that we never see because of the way these ephemeral platforms are sort of laid out.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.640]   So that's when I decided to build Made with ML. Just a short summary, it's basically a platform
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.680]   that you can go to to discover, organize and build machine learning projects. And basically,
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.160]   that was the inspiration to build this, have it be a place where all the content that we see is
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.640]   organized. And a lot of people are currently describing sort of a product hunt for machine
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.160]   learning projects. But just the front page right now, you can sort of see the top projects that
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.040]   are trending right now. A lot of these happen to be from the current conference that's going on
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.840]   right now. But a lot of them are added by the authors themselves. A lot of them are added by
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.560]   other people who found this content interesting. And when you look through stuff like this,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.960]   you can go ahead and upload it. That's the community curation aspect. And then if you
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.320]   think it's something that's going to be useful for your projects later on, you can go ahead and
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.040]   bookmark it as well. We're going to go ahead and probably just check out one of these projects.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.520]   Maybe I actually just found out about this today, but neural-backed decision trees are
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.560]   sort of combining deep neural nets with decision trees. So you get the same interpretability,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.640]   but performance of a neural net. So this is pretty cool. But when you click on a project,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.000]   you get to see a little description that the author may have posted about it.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You get the author's information, you click on the profile, you see the rest of their projects.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.400]   You see code, the actual paper, some other media like a demo, and then maybe a docs website or a
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.880]   personal website that they want to share about this. Something that's really cool is because
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.760]   everything is tagged, it's organized that way. And because people upvote it, it's curated by
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.440]   the things that are most useful or meaningful to the community. So when you click on a project,
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.960]   you get to see all this information. And then based on the tags, you get to see similar projects too.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.560]   And this also has some level of curation, but you get to really explore projects this way. After
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.040]   clicking on one, you sort of jump to the next and so forth, and really try to dig into what you're
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.240]   trying to do. So this is the front page. You get to see the top projects for today, this week,
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:17.120]   this month, and so forth. So we had this running for about two weeks. And a lot of people had
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.960]   really great feedback. People were saying it's kind of like the product time. It's really good.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.320]   It's a non-overwhelming way to keep on top of what's going on. But we also got a lot of
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.440]   complaints saying that the front page, I mean, if we look at it right now, it's fairly, I'd say,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.960]   intermediate/advanced content, with a few exceptions, people trying to break down some
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.080]   of the older concepts and visualizations. But otherwise, it's pretty up to date. And a lot
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.040]   of beginners were saying, it's hard for us to dive right in. So then what they do is they go to
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.760]   Google. They'll search topics. For example, if you go to Google right now and you search Transformers
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.480]   or BERT, you'll get a few good resources, but you'll find a lot of resources that are SEO,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.920]   search engine optimized, sometimes click-baity. And then unfortunately, a lot of articles or
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.440]   really good resources now have a paywall in front of them too, which really puts a barrier in terms
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.120]   of being able to learn something. So what we did was over the past month, people have been adding
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.400]   projects, tagging them. The community has been curating it. We basically just put a search layer
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.600]   on top of this. And then we expose some of the popular topics that people care about. And now
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.800]   we just released this a couple of days ago, but it's called the topics page. Basically for all
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.080]   the major topics you care about, right? So frameworks, algorithms, certain specific applications,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.560]   concepts, even full stack and data and modeling and things like that. You can go ahead and actually
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.760]   click on one of these concepts. So let's go ahead and click on the Transformers. And we've organized,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.400]   you get a little brief description. I'll come back to this section in a bit. But when you click on a
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.920]   topic, you get to see the top tutorials. You get to see the top toolkits. So what are the open source
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.000]   toolkits I can use for this specific topic, because I'm trying to build something.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.600]   The top research for this topic, and then the most recent stuff that's going on. And then for all of
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.880]   these, you get to click more and find out more. Now, this was something that people could go to
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.440]   and use. And this content, a lot of this isn't recent. These are the foundational, timeless,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.440]   I'd say gold mines of resources that people have been using like myself over the last three,
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.320]   four or five years. Examples would be things like CS231 lectures or Chris Ola's original blog,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.240]   sort of resources that never become outdated because they're so foundational. So myself,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.280]   we have many moderators now, including some people, actually, Sayegh is going to be speaking
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.840]   later. And then we have other folks who love sharing really great content with the community.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   So through their help, we were able to get over 600 projects added, many of them by the authors
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.080]   themselves, and then really create this topics page. Now, I skipped this part. So these are the
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.840]   best tutorials, toolkits and research right now, and that changes. But for every topic, this is
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.880]   sort of an expert curated list to get started with a certain topic. So this really won't change over
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.560]   time unless something really great comes along. But these are sort of the resources you should
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.400]   go straight down the line. So if you're trying to learn about Transformer, start with this video,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.080]   then get into Illustrator Transformer, which has a little bit of code. This one has a lot of code
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.160]   and sort of get into deeper and deeper sort of understanding of the topic. And then you can
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.120]   start working this way. So that's basically the gist of the platform. I wanted to talk about just
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.880]   a few specific features. I wrote a list in case I forget. But a lot of people have started to use
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.000]   this as sort of their place to organize all the projects that they're working on as well. So you
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.040]   get to use it as a profile. So not as a pick on side, but he's got a great profile. So these are
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.080]   some of the things that he's worked on and he's added, and he's created this profile over time.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.800]   And on his page, you can see his projects, things that he's uploaded and bookmarked,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.920]   his interests, his tech stack. And these are his top five projects right now. And if you go ahead
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.360]   and click this, you can see all of his projects. But it's a great way to make sort of have all
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.760]   your stuff in one place. And it's tagged and curated so the community can easily find stuff.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.280]   And it's not sort of isolated in one place. And there's no barrier for people to really get access
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.920]   to this. So actually, amidst all this COVID quarantine, a lot of my friends have been
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.880]   getting laid off as well. And people are really using this time to learn. So we're having a lot
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.880]   of people learn a lot right now and share a lot of projects that they're working on, and then
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.680]   create this profile, which hopefully they'll use to get whether it's getting their next job or
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:58.160]   collaborations, things like that. So that's pretty much it for the main features. Something pretty
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.920]   cool I wanted to show within the topics page. So obviously, these are concrete topics that a lot
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.200]   of people know about. But we also started surfacing really cool tags that people started adding that
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.680]   aren't necessarily well-known tags. So for example, there's this genre of checklist. And I'm
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.200]   sure we've all seen, you know, Karpathy's recipe for training your neural nets or Chipro's machine
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.480]   learning design, FastAI's articles. So these are checklists that people have created that you
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.800]   should just sort of for various parts of machine learning pipeline that you should just go down to
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.680]   check, make sure you're doing the right things. So that's a pretty cool one. And there's also,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.160]   you can check these out later, but there's illustrated, which are really well illustrated
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.680]   resources, self-supervised, transformer, et cetera. And then obviously you have courses and surveys
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.240]   and things like that. So we're starting to see really cool collections show up. And then that's,
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.360]   yeah, that's sort of pretty much it for the features. For, by the way, for anything that's
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.080]   not on in the topics page, you can obviously search for it on the search bar as well. So,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.240]   you know, right now, graph neural networks are pretty popular. So if you search for that,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.480]   you will get the top resources, you know, this article, these libraries, but let's say you care
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.840]   about, okay, not everything about GNNs, but specific toolkits, go ahead and add toolkit in
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.440]   there. And it'll just give you the curated toolkits that are used for this specific topic.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.400]   Similarly, you can search for tutorials and you can search for research as well.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.440]   That is pretty much it. I think the community has been really helpful with this. We've had a
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.120]   lot of great feedback. The way people are using this is, you know, they use it as the resource
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.280]   that they use first thing in the morning, sort of check what's happening and it's presented in a
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.480]   non-overwhelming way. And then as they're working on projects, they go ahead and add it. And if,
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.880]   or if you find something interesting, you can also add it to the platform, which a lot of people
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.760]   have really helped out in doing, including Insider. And by the way, when you do add a project
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.120]   that someone has already added, you'll get an alert saying it's already exists. So we don't
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:09.680]   have duplicate projects. That's pretty much it for this. One piece of feedback I'd love to share,
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.320]   these are the kinds of feedback that I love. You know, so he's a researcher that's done fantastic
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.680]   research in the health space. And because, you know, he's not from a top tier university,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.480]   it was difficult for him to get his content out. So seeing this really, really made, really made
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.800]   it worth it to build a platform like this. I'll sort of end it here. I do want to say I built
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.600]   this platform for the community, but I also built it for myself. And I wanted a place to go to,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.680]   to learn very quickly and be able to share my work. So, you know, through Made with ML, we're
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   also going to be using all this content to make lessons. The very next one that we're going to
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.320]   create is probably in a week or two, sort of an end to end, you know, what should a project look
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.200]   like, whether you're using that for getting a job or collaboration, whatever it is. And if you guys
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   are interested in finding out more, go ahead and make your free account today. This platform is
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.000]   always going to be 100% free. We're also on Twitter, if you want to get daily updates on
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.920]   trending content and new features and GitHub. And please feel free to email any features you'd like
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   to see and any feedback or if there's any mistakes or anything like that. So that's pretty much it.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.320]   Thank you. This is insanely cool. And for those of you who don't know, Goku built this
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:33.440]   course called Practical AI and his entire thing is to democratize access to machine learning.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.680]   And he does things that, you know, levels the playing field for everyone.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.840]   So thank you for building this.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:48.880]   If you have some questions, a lot of you guys asked how is this different from
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.160]   papers with code? And I think they asked this in the beginning, but as you
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.600]   showed, but yeah, would you like to speak more about that?
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.440]   Yeah, it'll be really quick. So I use papers with code still, I think they've done a fantastic job of
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.680]   sort of having a place for research, and also benchmarking that benchmarking that research
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:11.280]   hour with with SodaBench and things like that. I wanted to have a place where you don't have to
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.160]   share, you don't have to go through, you know, year long, or sometimes multi years to make a put
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.720]   out a paper, right. So there's a lot of practical work that's happening right now, people are
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.000]   building full end to end, full stack applications and things like that, sort of create a place for
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.280]   people to share that type of content, too. And I think papers with code is fantastic
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.640]   for research. And we're sort of trying to do the same and democratize all these resources for
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.680]   practical applications.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:45.520]   Someone else asked, would you like to talk more about collaboration on Made with ML?
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.680]   And how people can add?
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.080]   Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So there's a couple ways, you can obviously add your own projects,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:58.560]   you can also add someone else's projects that you find interesting. And then something else
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.000]   that we're currently working on, which we're trying to get maybe in about three or four weeks,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.080]   we actually want to bring content creation directly on the platform as well. So I'm sure a lot of you
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.600]   are familiar with fast pages. And I think Hamel actually gave a GitHub actions talk in the last
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.080]   Deep Learning Salon, we're trying to make it so you write your article on your Word document or
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.720]   GitHub, read me exactly like fast pages. And we'll use fast pages with a click of a button,
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.760]   you can host, you know, you can host your article styled and everything directly on Made with ML,
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.560]   it comes with the tags, you can add your own, obviously. So now it's sort of a democratized
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.880]   fast page, you make you write your article, you tag everything. And then when it comes time to
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.960]   share with the community, it's automatic with one, one click, you can add your resource right away.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:47.440]   So I think that would be a great way the all the tools and features that we're building is it's all
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:53.200]   to try to make it easier and give people guidance towards working on really fantastic projects.
