[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5 and verse 21.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   The 21st verse in the 5th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   But those who were here last Sunday morning will remember that we indicated that the older and better manuscripts are all agreed in saying that it should read
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   In the fear of Christ.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Now we come back once more to consideration of this statement.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Because as I was indicating last Sunday morning it is such a vital one and important one.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Especially in the understanding of that which is to follow.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I argued you remember that this statement here is at one and the same time a continuation of what the apostle has already been saying.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And a kind of general introduction to what he is going to say.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And it is important that we should bear both those things in mind.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   He is addressing people who are filled with the spirit.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And one of the characteristics of people who are filled with the spirit is that they submit themselves one to another.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Unlike the pagans, those who belong to the world and those who are filled with wine wherein is excess.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   They are not out to show themselves or to display themselves or to assert their own rights.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The spirit always has the effect of making people meek and ready to surrender and to abase themselves for the sake of others.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Now we looked at all that both negatively and positively.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And the two elements must always be borne in mind.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   They are not to be like those Gentiles filled with wine wherein is excess.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   They must not do the things they do.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   But on the contrary they must be as people who are thus filled with the spirit.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And we have already seen some of the characteristics of such people.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   He has been telling us that they speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Singing and making melody in their hearts to the Lord.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And we worked that out.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   The point that he emphasizes is that they are all to do it together.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That even in their singing they are to do it together.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   They are not to show their voices.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Not to show what wonderful voices they have got.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Not to hold out at the end of a line in order that their voice may be heard.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Not to call attention to themselves.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   But they are to make melody.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Which means that they must all be doing it together.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Controlling themselves if they have powerful voices.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   So that they all may sing at the same time and in the same way.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And make melody thus together in their hearts to the Lord.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   The picture you see he has in his mind there is that of a choir.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   As I said in working it out.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Not a series of brilliant soloists but a choir.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   A blending.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   A working together.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   A harmony.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So that there is nothing which is clashing or irritating.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Nothing which is of the flesh.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   But it is done always in the spirit.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Well now he is continuing with all that.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And you see it is the same idea.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Not men taking the leadership upon himself.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   But everybody submitting in order that they may work harmoniously together.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   The other picture is as I was showing of course that of the body.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And the whole secret of the working of the body.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Is that every part is subservient thus to every other part.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   If any one part of the body is overactive at the expense of the others.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Well that is disease.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And it produces a kind of monstrosity.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So the apostle you see is really continuing with what he has already been saying.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   But at the same time he is also introducing what is about to follow.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   In other words he does not merely leave it at saying submitting yourselves one to another.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   There is this further addition to which I am calling attention this morning.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It is in the fear of Christ.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Now we must look at this addition.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Because here we are told exactly how and why we are to submit ourselves one to the other.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   This last phrase of the apostles provides us in other words with the motives for submitting ourselves one to the other.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Let us look at it like this.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I divide it in the following way.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Let us see first of all why we are to submit ourselves one to another.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   The reasons for doing so.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And his answer is in the fear of Christ.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Now this is not just a casual addition that he makes.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It is not just a phrase to round off the injunction.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It is not something that he just wrote without thinking about it.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Or accidentally.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   As people are sometimes tempted to do, those who would have us know their spirituality,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   they intersperse their conversation with certain clichÃ©s and phrases.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   They keep on saying praise the Lord almost every other sentence.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Now that is not the way in which the apostle added this phrase, in the fear of Christ.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   It is not done thoughtlessly and glibly and superficially like that.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It is obviously done because it is an essential part of his teaching.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I can prove that to you quite easily.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Here you see he is laying down his general principle.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   We are to live a life which is characterized by this, that we submit ourselves one to another.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Then, as we remember, he takes this up in three particular instances.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Wives and husbands, children and parents, servants and masters.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   But what is so interesting to observe is this, that in each of the three instances,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   as here in the general statement of the principle, he is very careful to make this addition.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Now look at it. Here it is first of all in the general principle.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Now then, first instance, the wives, verse 22.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   He does not stop at saying, "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands."
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   He adds, "as unto the Lord."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Then look at the second instance, the children.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   First verse of chapter 6, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord."
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Still the same addition.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   He does not just say, "Children, obey your parents, for this is right."
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   He says, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Still the same addition.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And then in the third instance, with the servants and the masters, we have got the same thing.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Listen to him in verses 5 and following.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   "Servants, obey, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Not with thy service as men pleases, but as the servants of Christ,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   doing the will of God from the heart, with good will doing service as to the Lord,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   and not to men, knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And ye masters do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   knowing that your master also is in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Very well, you see this is clearly a controlling principle.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And it is idle for us to go on to consider the duties of wives towards their husbands
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   or children to parents or servants to masters,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   unless we are clear about this overriding principle
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   of the way in which we do it, the reason why we must do it.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   What then exactly does this mean?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Well, we can put it first of all in a general form like this.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   This is the motive which is to govern the whole of Christian living.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Everything that the Christian does is to be done in the fear of Christ.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   He is proving that, you see, by repeating it so constantly in these individual instances.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Now, here is something which we ignore at our peril.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   It is in the fear of Christ.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   What does it mean exactly? Well, let me put it negatively first.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   We are to do this, we are to submit ourselves one to another
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   and do all the things that come out of it,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   not because this is a good thing in and of itself,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   and because not to do so is bad.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I mean this, of course,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   that there are men in the world who do this kind of thing
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   because they believe it is a right thing to do,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   but that does not make them Christian.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   The thing that marks off the Christian from the men who are not a Christian
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   is not merely that he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ and the salvation,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   and trusts him and his atoning work.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   No, in addition to that,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   the life of the Christian is governed altogether by this person.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Jesus Christ is Lord,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   and you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You cannot believe in him as saviour only,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   you believe in him as Lord.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   If you have any belief in him whatsoever, you believe in the whole Christ,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   and therefore he becomes the Lord of your life.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And the Christian does not merely do things because they are good and right,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   and because it is wrong to do certain other things.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Anybody can do that.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   The differentiating mark of the Christian is this one,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   that he does everything as unto the Lord,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   in the fear of Christ,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   because Christ is his Lord.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   This, of course, is something that revolutionises thought.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Let me put it, therefore, in the form of another negative,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   submitting yourselves one to another.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Quite so.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Here, say, somebody is a principle that I am in entire agreement with.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I have no use for your talk about the blood of Christ and atonement and so on,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   but when you say that we should all submit ourselves one to another,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   now that's something I agree with.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   That's what I call the egalitarian state.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It's the doing away with all classes and divisions and distinctions.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   We all become one.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   All men are equal.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   But that isn't what the apostle says.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   We are not to submit ourselves one to another because of some political or social or philosophical teaching which we may hold.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   There are people who hold that teaching,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   that egalitarian philosophy,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   that everybody is to be reduced to the same common level.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   It doesn't matter what they are nor who they are.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   All are brought to that level.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   That isn't what the apostle says at all.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another. Why?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Well, not because it's your political or social theory,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   but in the fear of Christ.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Altogether different.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Now, I'm not expressing my opinion on political and social and philosophical theories.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   All I am concerned to emphasize this morning is this,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   that the Christian motive for doing these things is altogether different
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   from that which applies in the case of the non-Christian.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And therefore, to confuse Christian teaching or to reduce Christian teaching to political theory,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   to socialism or whatever else it may be,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   is a travesty of the gospel.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Now, I'm not concerned, I say, about the politics.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   But I am concerned about showing that the Christian position is always this,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   in the fear of Christ.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And though by act of Parliament you reduce all men to a common denominator,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   you don't make them Christians thereby.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   If it isn't for this reason, it is of no value at all.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Or, let me give you another negative.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   We are not to submit ourselves one to another,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   simply because it is the thing to do in certain circles and under certain conditions.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   You know there are social conventions that do this, aren't there?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   You just stand back and make way, submitting yourselves one to another.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   That isn't what the Apostle is talking about.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   He doesn't say that you put on a sort of social uniform,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   or affect the manners of a certain class or a certain group,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   that you give the impression that you are submitting yourselves,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   whereas, of course, the whole time in your heart you are doing the exact opposite,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and that this apparent submission is a sign of your real superiority,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   that you are prepared to do that and you are proud of it.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   This isn't etiquette.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   No, no.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   The world appears very wonderful, doesn't it?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   You look on and you see a man standing back and bowing,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   but the question is what about his heart and why is he doing it?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Is he doing it in the fear of Christ?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Social conventions are not in the mind of the Apostle at all,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   because they are always superficial.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   They are unreal.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   The Christian has a profound and a deep motive,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   and it is the fear of Christ.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   This is the thing that governs him.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   This is the thing that always rules him.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And then let me give you one other negative.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I wonder whether this will shock you.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   We are to submit ourselves one to the other,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   and in the matter of wives and husbands and children and parents and servants and masters,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   not even for the sake of keeping the law,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   even the law of God,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   that is not the Christian's primary motive.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   The motive of the Christian is always in the fear of Christ.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Some of the things he is told to do, of course, have already been stated in the law.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Take children, for instance.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Honour thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Yes, the commandment said it.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   And the Christian is to do this thing which is indicated in the commandment, yes,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   but he has got another reason and a new reason for doing it.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   The Jew is meant to keep the commandment,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   the Christian does it in the Lord, in the fear of Christ.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   He is not merely concerned about keeping the law.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   He has this higher motive.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It is in the fear of Christ.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Now then, this is the differentiating mark of the Christian always.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   The Christian does not think of himself in terms of the law even any longer.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He always thinks of himself in this relationship, not as being without law,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   but as being under law to Christ, in the fear of Christ,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   in this personal relationship to his Lord and Saviour.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   The apostle therefore goes on repeating this in order to impress that upon us.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And of course it is essential for this reason,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   that it is only as we are governed by this motive that we shall be able to do this.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And of course a man who is filled with the Spirit
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   is a man who is filled with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   The Spirit points to him, the Spirit glorifies him,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   the Spirit always leads to him.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And so the man filled with the Spirit will ever be looking at him.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   And this is his one grand motive, in the fear of Christ.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   And having this, he is enabled to do these various things.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   So I'll sum it up by putting it in this form.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   The difference between the Christian and the non-Christian is this.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   The Christian always knows why he does a thing.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   He always knows what he is doing.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   You see, we've already been reminded that he's not unwise,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   We saw that in verse 17.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   That's the difference. The other man doesn't know why he does things.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   He conforms to pattern. He imitates others.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   He watches what they do and he does them.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   He doesn't know why. He hasn't really got the philosophy of the thing.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   He just does it. He's always conforming.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   But here's a man who thinks and who reasons.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   He's got wisdom. He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And the reason always is in the fear of Christ.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   What does this mean? How does it work out?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   What are his particular reasons and motives?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Well, the first one is obviously this one.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   The Christian submits himself to others and does these other things
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   because this is something that has been plainly and clearly taught
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   by the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Now, at the beginning last Sunday morning,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I read to you two passages out of the Gospels
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   which make this perfectly plain and clear.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   There was one in the 20th chapter of Matthew's Gospel
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   which illustrates and illumines this whole subject once and forever.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Matthew 20, beginning at verse 20.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   "Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And he said unto her, 'What wilt thou?'
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And she said, 'Grant that these my two sons may sit,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   the one on my right hand and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.'
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   But Jesus answered and said, 'You know not what you ask.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Are you able to drink of the cup that I drink of?'"
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And then he goes on and makes this vital statement.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   The ten, of course, when they heard this,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Why? Well, because they wanted to be in that supreme position themselves.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   They were annoyed with the brothers because they'd got it in first, as it were.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And we got all so clear about these deficiencies in others,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   so they were filled with indignation.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   "But Jesus called them unto him and said,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   'You know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   and that they that are great exercise authority upon them.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   But it shall not be so among you,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.'"
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Now there, you see, he has given explicit teaching on this very subject.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   So the Christian need be in no doubt or hesitation,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   it is one of the clearest commandments and pieces of teaching
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   ever given by our blessed Lord.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Well, then there's that other extraordinary and marvellous illustration of it in John 13.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Here is our Lord on the very eve of his death.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   "We are told that having loved his own which were in the world,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   he loved them unto the end.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And then this remarkable thing happened."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Verse 12, "So after he had washed their feet,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   and had taken his garments and was set down again,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   he said unto them," you remember what had happened, don't you?
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and that he was come from God and went to God."
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   "Knowing that, he riseth from supper,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and laid aside his garments, and took a towel, and girded himself.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   After that he poureth water into a basin,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   and began to wash the disciples' feet,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded."
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And they couldn't understand it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Peter was objecting to this, and our Lord had to rebuke him and teach him.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   "So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   and was set down again, he said unto them,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Know ye what I have done to you?
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Do you understand what I have been doing?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Do you see its meaning? Do you see its significance?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You call me Master and Lord,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and you say, 'Well, for so I am.'
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   If then I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   you also are to wash one another's feet.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   For I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   The servant is not greater than his Lord,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   neither is he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   If you know these things, happy are you if you do them."
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   There was never a plainer teaching than this.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   There is no need to argue about this.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   There is no need to be in any difficulty,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   or in any doubt or darkness with respect to it.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Our Lord once and forever in that act of washing the disciples' feet,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   has placed it before us.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   It is in the category, you see, of baptism and of the Lord's Supper.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   He has taken an action, he has done something,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   and there the picture should ever be before us.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   That is why we submit ourselves one to another,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   because he has taught us to do so.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Listen to him saying again,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   "By this, he says, shall all men know that you are my disciples,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   if you have love one to another."
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   That's how they are going to know it.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And indeed he says it again in the great high priestly prayer,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   where he prays that they all may be one,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   as he and the Father are one,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   that all men may know that they are his disciples,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   and that the Father has sent him.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   So our first great reason for paying great heed to this is,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   that our Lord has gone out of his way to teach it.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Here he is the Lord of glory, but he humbled himself.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Lord and Master, yet he submits himself.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   He is not like the princes of the world.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   No, no, he is in a different category.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   We must get rid of all human thinking.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   He is the Son of God who has come down to be our minister.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and to give his life a ransom for many.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Well, there's the first reason, but listen to a second.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   The second is, of course, that we are to do these things, therefore,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   in order to show our gratitude to him.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   If we really believe what we claim to believe as Christians,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   our supreme desire in life should be to show our gratitude to him.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Do we really believe that he is the Son of God?
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   That he came down from heaven to earth in order to save us?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Not only by living his perfect life,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   but especially by going deliberately to the cross,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   taking our sins upon him,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   bearing our sins and their punishment.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   He gave his life, he died that we might be forgiven,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   that we might be reconciled unto God.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   No, the argument is this, if we really believe that,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   our supreme desire should be to please him,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   to show our gratitude to him.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   He's done that for us.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   What does he want us to do?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Well, he wants us to keep his commandments.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And he wants us to keep his commandments in order
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   that his name might be magnified and glorified amongst other people.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   You see, there again, in the great high priestly prayer,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   he put it like this.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   He, praying to the Father, says,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   "I have glorified thy name in the earth,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   and then I am glorified in them."
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   This is the thing that should always govern all our practice,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   that the Lord Jesus Christ is glorified in the world, in us, through us.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   This isn't a matter of argument.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It isn't a matter of whether we like it or not.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   He has said it and it is obviously true.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Men and women outside are judging the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   and forming their assessments of him by what they see in us.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And of course, if they look at us and see a conduct and a behavior
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   which is identical with that in the world,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   every man striving for superiority,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   every man trying to show himself and to call attention to himself,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   well, they say, "This is the world."
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   That's what the world does.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   The world doesn't work in harmony.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   There are always clashes.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   These individualists were always asserting themselves
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   that they may call attention to themselves.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   That's how the world sings.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   That's how it does everything.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And if they see that in us,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   how can they possibly believe in and worship the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   His claim is not only that he has died for us,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   but that he gives us new life,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   that he creates us anew,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   that he regenerates us,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   that we are essentially different,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   that we are filled with the Spirit that was in him.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   I am glorified in them.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   So the Christian is a man who is always remembering this.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   He doesn't ask, "What do I want to do?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   What would I like to do?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   What pleases me?" No, no.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   He has lost himself in his love for Christ,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   his gratitude to him.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   His desire is, I say, to show his gratitude.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   He has got a zeal for the name of the Lord.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   He wants others to believe in him.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Well, now, the way to do that, of course, is primarily to live.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   It's no use talking to people if you deny it in your practice.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   It's no use preaching if I deny it in my life.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   People look at us and what we are and what we do.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Well, therefore, he says, "Submit yourselves one to the other
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   in the fear of Christ."
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   This is your governing and overruling motive.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   But let me take it a step higher.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   That is our desire to please him
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   and to show our love to him.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   You notice he uses the word "fear"
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   in the fear of Christ.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   And this means this, amongst other things,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   a fear of disappointing him,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   a fear of grieving him.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   The Scripture tells us that Christ says,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   "Behold me and the children that thou hast given me."
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   We are his possession. We are his people.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   His name is upon us.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   We are his representatives.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   We are the people whom he has bought and whom he has purchased.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And the relationship is one, I say, of love.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   So that the Christian is a man who is governed by thoughts of that.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   He is looking down upon us.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   His reputation, as it were, is in our hands.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   I am glorified in them.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   He says, "I am the light of the world. You are the light of the world."
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   The world doesn't see him, it sees us.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   We are the light, the only light that it has got.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And the Christian is a man who lives and walks
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   and does all he does in the light of that.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Are we disappointing him?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   That's how love thinks, isn't it?
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   That is the kind of fear that comes into the realm of love.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   It's altogether higher than law.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   This is the fear of hurting or of grieving
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   or of disappointing someone who loves you
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   and who has got faith in you, who trusts you,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   who admires you, who is fond of you,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   who has done so much for you.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And this is the marvellous thing about it.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   That's why love is the greatest power
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and the greatest motive force in the whole world.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   A man is unable to do things for love
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   which he cannot do by his own willpower or anything else.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Love is the grandest and the greatest motive.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And it partly operates, you see, in that way.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Is there anything more terrible than to think
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   that we are disappointing the one who so loved us
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   that he gave himself for us?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   That we should grieve him?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   That we should be unworthy of him?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Parents, you know this feeling about your children.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Children should have the same feeling about their parents.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   This is the way the Christian lives.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   It isn't, I say, putting on a uniform.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   It isn't some political social theory.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   No, no, it's his love to us and our relationship to him
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   and our fear, our dread, lest in any way
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   we should grieve him or disappoint him.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   But I've got to take it even a step beyond that.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   There is a fear that should govern all we are and all we do,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   that should govern us in the matter of living and sanctification
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and in the matter of all our service.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   And it is something which is stated very frequently
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   in the New Testament.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   I wonder how much are we influenced by this particular fear
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   to which I am now going to call your attention.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Listen to the apostle putting it to the Corinthians
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   in the first epistle, chapter 3.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Let me begin to read at verse 9, if you like.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   "For we are laborers together with God.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   You are God's husbandry, you are God's building.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   According to the grace of God which is given unto me
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   and another man buildeth thereon.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   which is Christ Jesus.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   If any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   every man's work shall be made manifest.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   For the day shall declare it,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   because it shall be revealed by fire.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   And the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   he shall receive a reward.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   But he himself shall be saved.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Yet so as by fire.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Know ye not that ye are the temple of God
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   For the temple of God is holy, which temple are ye?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Now there's another fear, isn't it?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   The day shall declare it.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Let me give you some other examples of this
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   before we draw the doctrine out of it.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Take again what he says at the end of chapter 9
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   in this first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Let me read from verse 24.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   but one receiveth the prize?
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   So run that ye may obtain.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And every man that striveth for the mastery
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   is temperate in all things.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   but we an incorruptible.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I therefore so run, not as uncertainly,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   so fight I, not as one that beateth the air,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Why? Lest that by any means when I have preached to others,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I myself should be a castaway.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   in the fear of Christ.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Go on to the second epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   to chapter 5, and let's begin to read at verse 9.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Wherefore we labour that whether present or absent
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   we may be accepted of him.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   that every one may receive the things done in the body
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   according to that he hath done,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   whether it be good or bad.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   we persuade men.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   But we are made manifest to God, and I trust also,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   are made manifest in your consciences.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Knowing the terror of the Lord, I persuade men.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   in the fear of Christ, the terror of the Lord.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Go on to chapter 7 of that same second epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and read the first verse.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I'm not saying these things, it's the apostles that are saying them.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Let us go on to Galatians chapter 6,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   and let me read there from the first verse.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   And this is what we find.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   The last chapter of Galatians.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   you which are spiritual,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   restore such an one in the spirit of meekness,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Bury one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   The same thing you see.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   If a man think himself to be something when he is nothing,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   he shall not believe it himself,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   but let every man prove his own work.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   for every man shall bear his own burden.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And then you saw that great statement in Philippians 2, 12 and 13.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   That's how you are to work it out.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   That's why you are to submit yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   And then in writing to Timothy, you see he says exactly the same thing.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   In his second epistle, in the second chapter, verse 19.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   There are people, he says, who are doing things that are wrong.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   The Lord knoweth them that are his,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   And of course, I suppose the supreme example of it all
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   is at the end of the twelfth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   in verses 28 and 29.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Wherefore, we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   with reverence and godly fear.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   For our God is a consuming fire.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   What does all this mean?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Well, this has got nothing to do with our justification.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   This has got nothing to do with our salvation.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   What is this? Ah, this is something different.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   This is a fear in the matter of rewards.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Take the apostle in that first statement in 1 Corinthians 3.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   He says every man's work is going to be tried.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And if a man has built upon the foundation wood and hay and stubble,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   it will all be burned, there will be nothing left.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   He himself shall suffer loss.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Yet he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   It's a great mystery this. I don't pretend to understand it.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Nobody understands it.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   But the teaching seems to be quite clearly this.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And it applies to all the other passages.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Not one of those passages has reference to a man's salvation.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   But it does have reference to the reward that he's going to receive.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   It is possible for a man to be saved so as by fire,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   that he'll arrive in eternity with nothing at all.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Nothing that he's done which is of value.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Nothing. It's all gone.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   It's been destroyed by the fire of judgment.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   He himself is saved, yet so as by fire.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   And it's exactly the same in all these other passages.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   It doesn't mean that a man can fall from grace.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   No, but it does mean this.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   That a man who is saved can know the terror of the Lord.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   We must all stand before the judgment throne of Christ.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   And give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Very well, says the apostle, submit yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Christian people.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   You and I are going to stand before him and look into his eyes and look into his face.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Can you imagine what it will be like to feel this at that moment?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Ah yes, I believed that Christ died for me.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   I believed in the blood of Christ and I traded on it.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   I did what I wanted. I didn't obey his commandments.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   I didn't do what he told me.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I didn't perfect holiness in the fear of God.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   I didn't submit myself to others.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   I asserted myself. I was so much of the natural man still.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Can you imagine what it will be like just to look into his eyes?
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Well, I can give you some conception of it.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   You remember the apostle Peter.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Our Lord had warned him that he was going to deny him three times before the cock crew.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   And Peter protested.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And then the time came when the servant maid challenged him and Peter, anxious to save his skin in his cowardice, denied his Lord.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   And you remember what we are told afterwards?
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   The Lord looked upon Peter and he went out and he wept bitterly.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   The Lord didn't say a word to him.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   He just looked at him.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   He looked at him that look of disappointment, that look of sorrow.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Peter had let him down.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Peter couldn't stand it.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   He'd have preferred words. He'd have preferred denunciation.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   He'd have preferred a thrashing.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   He'd have preferred to be thrown into jail.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   This was the thing that broke him and almost killed him.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Jesus looked upon Peter.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   It was the look in his eye, knowing the terror of the Lord, submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Why, innocent husbands, there's no need to argue.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Children and parents, there's no argument or discussion.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Servants and masters, no, no, he's told us what his will is.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   He's given us an example.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   We're without excuse.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   I say, therefore, let us submit ourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   It's the only motive.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   It is the sufficient motive.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   But thank God he gives us encouragement.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   He gives us an incentive.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   We've got this glorious encouragement and what is it?
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   It is his own example.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Paul has already used it at the beginning of this fifth chapter.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   "Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour."
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   And then take that most glorious statement of it in Philippians 2.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   "Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Is it difficult to submit to others in the way we've indicated?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Is it difficult to control ourselves and submerge ourselves and get rid of that egotism and so on?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Is it difficult?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Well, if you find it difficult as a Christian, here's your answer.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   even the death of the cross.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   If that doesn't do it, nothing can do it.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ,
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   that he might follow his steps who did no wrong, neither was guile found in his mouth.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   When he suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes we are healed.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   We are to live this life not because it's the thing to do,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   not because it's a uniform we now put on now that we are saved and converted,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   or because others are doing it, or any other reason.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   No, no. This is the only reason, the only motive.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And thank God it's not only enough, it's more than enough.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
