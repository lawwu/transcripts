[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue, where, Duncan, I think the questions we're getting are getting
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.400]   more intelligent by the week. I think we've got a great lineup this week. Before we get
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.720]   started, I want to start off with going over the stock market and provide another glasses-half-full
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.200]   look from Ben. I've provided some glasses-half-empty looks in the past. So, right now, the S&P
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.960]   is down 15%. Nasdaq and Russell 2000 are down 24%. Here's the good news. Let's say this
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.400]   is where it stops. To break even, the gain for the S&P is like 18% from here. For the
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.080]   Nasdaq and Russell 2000, it's like over 30%. Now, let's say stocks go down further. They
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   go down 30% from here, right? Everything's down 30% from the all-time highs. That's like
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.040]   a 45% gain to break even, almost. 43%, if we want to be technical. Down 40%, that requires
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.800]   a 67% gain. Now, you say, "Okay, that's fine. But how long did it take?" Because that's
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.200]   all that matters. John, throw up this chart here about how long it takes to break even.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.400]   I did this in March 2020, so now we're the last one on here. The average amount of time
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.880]   from peak to trough to peak, right? You do a full round trip. Since 1928, it's 26 months.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.240]   The longest one ever is the Great Depression, which was a little over 13 years. It took
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.320]   more than three years following the Great Recession of 2008. And then, the '73-'74 bear
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.960]   market was almost four years. The dot-com bubble was about four years, too. So, those
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.680]   are worst-case scenarios to break even. Obviously, the biggest questions are, how long until
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.640]   we bottom? Because no one knows if we've bottomed yet or if there's still way more pain to come.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.920]   How long does it take to break even? But the thing that you remember is, if we go back
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.400]   to all-time highs, even just getting there, it's pretty good returns from here. So, if
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.360]   you're saving, that's a good thing. Your returns are going to be pretty good. Obviously, what
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.560]   they look like in terms of an annualized basis depends on how long it takes. But expect your
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.360]   returns are going up, right? Unless the world comes to an end. Then, they're going down.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.680]   Yeah. Yeah. Then, yeah. But we have other things to worry about, right, if that happens.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.640]   All right. And if you lost 90% in a stock, you just need like a 10-bagger to break even.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.040]   It's nothing. Right? It's easy.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.240]   Yeah. Yeah. No. That's staring me in the face. That's hitting too close to home.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.120]   All right. Let's do the first one.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.960]   Okay. Up first, we have, "Hey, Ben. I've been following your writing for years and love
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.120]   it. I just left a bank job to go to an RIA and can finally start writing. Do you have
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.520]   any writing tips, any tools to help with grammar?"
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.400]   By the way, I think the first time this question was sent, grammar was spelled wrong. But I'm
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.080]   not going to be the only person that points out grammatical mistakes of people because
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.440]   I make lots of mistakes. All right. My one book recommendation here, Steven Pressfield.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.040]   He's an author. I think he's done some screenplays. He actually wrote the book, "The Legend of
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.240]   Bagger Vance" if you ever saw that movie. "Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit" is his book.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.760]   Here's what he says this means. "None of us want to hear your self-centered, ego-driven,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.280]   unrefined demands for attention. Why should we? It's boring. There's nothing in it for
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   us."
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.520]   This book is really good in that it helps people understand you should probably be writing
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.160]   for yourself more than writing for other people. And if other people like it, that's fine.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.920]   But think about that in the context of who your audience is first. I think one of the
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.080]   things you have to realize if you just start writing is you don't have to reinvent the
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.800]   wheel just because it's been said before. It doesn't mean you can't put your own spin
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   on it.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.400]   I was approached probably two years after I started my blog to write a book. And my
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.840]   first thing I said was, "Why would I ever want to write a book? Everything that I would
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.560]   want to say has probably already been said before." And I actually asked Josh Brown.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.840]   I said, "Josh, you've written a book. What's the point of me writing a book?" And he's
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.600]   like, "Don't care what -- who cares what people before you have said? Not that many people
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.200]   read books, first of all. And second of all, you can put your own spin on it and say what
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.000]   you want to do and put your own personal experiences in it."
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.280]   And so I think that you have to remember that. There's this book called "How History Gets
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.040]   Things Wrong" by Alex Rosenberg. He had some crazy stats in here. "Abraham Lincoln's been
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.140]   the subject of 40,000 books. In 2014 to 2016 alone, there was eight books written on the
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.040]   Battle of the Bulge from World War II."
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.360]   There's new ways to spin old things if you want to. I think one thing you have to do
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.320]   to become a better writer is just make it a habit. I think writing a little bit every
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.360]   day, even if it's not that good, is important because you don't have to publish everything.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.320]   I have -- Duncan, I think our tech people told me I've got to delete some of them. I
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.000]   have 150 unposted drafts in my blog that I've never put out there because I started writing
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.960]   them and I didn't like it and I just let it go.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.200]   So I think writing is like a muscle that you have to exercise. I think you have to write
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.420]   about stuff that you personally care about and not worry so much about pandering to the
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.800]   audience because people can tell if you're kind of going through the motions and you
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.320]   don't really care about it. It has to be something that you have strong feelings about or you
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.520]   really feel like you have something to write about.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.960]   I think the other thing that really helps is just reading a lot. I think if you read
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.440]   a lot of other smart people, it helps you make better points and you can comment on
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.680]   the work other people have already done. You don't have to come up with something that's
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.520]   -- there was this -- I think Charlie Munger said this. People don't go to church to hear
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.600]   the 11th commandment. They already hear the 10. Reemphasize the points that people already
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   made before.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.200]   I think especially in finance, this is tooting our own horn here, but answering people's
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.680]   questions is very helpful, right? Especially if you're writing for your clients. There's
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.220]   going to be certain questions that come up over and over again depending on the environment
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.880]   or the time and it's just going to be those things are different. But you can create your
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.280]   own library to show that you've thought about this stuff.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.240]   And finally, I think you've got to keep it short. So Duncan, you've seen A River Runs
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.920]   Through It. That's a film, right? Not a movie.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   It's been a long time.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   You've probably seen that one.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.320]   Okay. So there's this scene where young Norman, who's the older brother, he's played by Joseph
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.080]   Gordon-Levitt and his preacher father is Tom Skerritt, who's the guy from the original.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.160]   And he's sitting at his desk and he's writing a paper and he brings it to his dad and he
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   says, "Take a look, Dad."
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.720]   And his dad crosses out a paragraph, crosses out a paragraph, says, "Shorter. Do it again."
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.360]   And he goes through it like three times. "Shorter. Do it again." And every time, and then at
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.180]   the end, I think he says, "Good. Now throw it away." But his point was like, you have
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.160]   to have it keep brevity because people don't have the attention span to read something
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   really long.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.600]   So I think write what you want to say, then go back and try to trim the fat because time
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.920]   is a valuable commodity. I guess the only grammar thing I would have, there's this program
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.360]   called Grammarly. You can put on your website, that'll find some errors for you. But I can
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   say-
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.720]   I've heard of that, yeah.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.680]   It helps out with misspellings and sometimes helps you restructure a sentence. But if there's
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.440]   two words that are spelled differently and mean different things, I mix those up all
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.520]   the time. And I can read something a hundred times and miss a completely, an error that's
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.440]   just staring you in the face, and someone new looks at it and they see it immediately.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.920]   So I think having a fresh set of eyes can help too.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.180]   Yeah, definitely. And I think sometimes people get too caught up on making mistakes. Hopefully
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.400]   Twitter has helped everyone not be as concerned about that. But yeah, I'm all the time, I'm
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.920]   one of those people, I'm a pretty good proofreader and I'm always reading books. And there are
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   mistakes in big time books. It's not the end of the world.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   And some people-
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   Yeah, and some people get really mad about it.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.080]   This whole book is discredited because they misspelled a word halfway through the book
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   or something.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.120]   Well, I had that happen to me where someone said, "I put the book down after page two."
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.800]   And you're going to get people like that? And my only advice is don't worry about people
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.160]   like that. If they really care that much, then you're never going to please them probably.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.360]   But yeah, I think the biggest thing is just making it a habit and turning it into a routine
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.280]   and doing it, I don't know, once a week or once every two weeks, whatever it is, find
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.880]   a cadence so people get used to your writing coming out. And whether it's a newsletter
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.600]   to your client in an email or a blog or whatever it is, get on a regular routine.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.960]   Yeah, no, that's good advice. Also, do you plan to ever release all of your unpublished
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.440]   drafts? That'd be an interesting book. We could have your archive.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.920]   Yeah, they're not very good. Obviously, I didn't put them out as a blog post, but yeah.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.800]   Nope, they're into the ether forever. They're lost.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   I bet there's some good stuff in there.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   Maybe on a blockchain someday. All right, let's do another one.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.880]   Okay. Up next, we have a long one, but it's a good one. It's also a sad one, but we're
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.400]   here for some optimism today. I'm 33 years old, married and make $75,000 a year. My rent
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:06.300]   just went up 21% to $3,300 a month, and I got outbid $100,000 on a home. I'm in desperate
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.520]   need of a new car, but there are no deals and there's no inventory. And I already spend
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.040]   a lot more than I make. Due to the sell-off in equities, I recently upped my 401(k) contribution
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:21.640]   to 15% from what was originally just the company match of 5%. This leaves my take-home net
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.320]   pay about $2,000 a month less than what I spend, but I'm using reserves to cover the
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.280]   difference. Not including my brokerage account and cash accounts, I have about $95,000 in
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.480]   IRAs. I have about $10,000 cash in my Rollover IRA and $6,000 cash in my Roth. I also, deep
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.440]   down in my gut, don't think I'm going to live past 60 due to medical issues. But nothing
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.080]   officially life-threatening yet, just a feeling. Besides the match amount, should I be contributing
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:57.120]   to my 401(k) at all or just using the cash balance in my IRAs first? How should my life
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.680]   outlook impact my retirement investing choices? Man, that's a bummer.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.580]   We could have done a whole episode on this question, but there's the old Charlie Munger
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:13.240]   quote where he says, "Tell me where I'm going to die so I don't go there." If this person
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.520]   does the Babe Ruth and points to the outfield and calls her own death, that's actually pretty
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.840]   impressive. I don't know where to go with that one. I guess you have to learn how to
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.680]   balance between now and later, and understanding your time horizon. Maybe it's one of those
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.280]   things where we've had emails from people who watch our stuff, who have said that saved
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:40.640]   our whole life and then got into retirement and my husband died. Or, we just decided to
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.640]   sail around the world and at 40 years old someone had a heart attack and corrupted us.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.440]   There are things like that. Maybe you just learn how to enjoy things. But I think this
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.460]   whole question is a perfect example that, for the majority of the population, personal
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.880]   finances is way more important than your portfolio. Because all this stuff is personal finance-related.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.080]   It has nothing to do with investing. I like the idea that you're trying to save more in
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:08.440]   your 401(k) now because stocks are down. But by saving more in your 401(k) and then pulling
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.200]   from your IRAs, you're essentially moving money from your left pocket to your right
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.840]   pocket. Because you said you're underwater every month, you're going $2,000 in the hole
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.320]   by drawing from those IRAs. I think you have to ask yourself, is that really a good trade-off?
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:29.080]   Especially if you don't plan on living that long, what good is a 401(k) now anyway? I'm
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.120]   going to say, maybe as a hedge to living a little bit longer. Maybe if medical technology
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.680]   turns your forecast of an early death, makes it a moot point, you might want to hedge and
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.280]   keep that 401(k). But at least keep getting the match.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.640]   The big expenses are the ones that matter. It's mortgage, rent, transportation, debt,
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.040]   income, all these things. And unfortunately, it sounds like mortgage is going up, or your
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.360]   rent is going up, transportation costs could be going up. I don't know, if you have a lifetime
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.780]   warranty on that car, I might be willing to let that beater go a little more, and see
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.840]   if we finally get some new cars, and they put the chips in those cars, and costs come
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   down a little bit.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.000]   For listeners and viewers, we abbreviated the question. They mentioned that they have
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   a 12-year-old, rusty old car that has a lifetime warranty.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.100]   And so, they're trying to deal all this up. I mean, there's two ways to get ahead financially.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.940]   You live more frugally, or you make more money. That's it, right? Everything else branches
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.480]   off of that. And so, I guess one way to think about it, because eventually, if you keep
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.040]   pulling from your savings, you're going to deplete them over time, if you don't start
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.440]   making more money or spending less.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.000]   So I don't know, have you looked for ways to increase your pay? Now is not the worst
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.760]   time to ask for a raise with inflation so high, right? If people are getting a cost-of-living
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.680]   inflation increase, now is the time to say, "Maybe you need to give me a little bit more."
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.080]   Have you looked at other jobs? People say, "In this economy?" Yeah, in this economy,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.740]   the job market is booming. Now is the time to work, to look.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.700]   It also sounds to me like you really probably need a budget, because if you're spending
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.380]   more than you're making, something is not adding up. So, John, pull up the You Need
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.960]   a Budget. I think this is a great website for anyone. It also, they have a book by the
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.280]   same name. It's called You Need a Budget. They put it down to YNAB. Jesse Meacham is
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.180]   the name of the guy. I've listened to a bunch of podcasts. His book is excellent. He helps
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.940]   people break down money into their fixed and variable expenses, and planning ahead for
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:23.020]   the future. It's really, really good. I honestly think this needs to be the place that you
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.460]   start, is figuring that out.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.100]   Obviously, you've done a good job saving so far, but somewhere along the way, whether
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.540]   it's your rent increased too far, or something else happened where you're spending more money,
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.700]   your budget got away from you, and you're having to tap savings. Eventually, that's
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:42.720]   probably going to run out, unless you're able to make more money. I get the idea of living
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.220]   a more balanced life, where you're saving some money now and not delaying all gratification,
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.740]   but eventually, if you don't get your personal finances under control, it's not going to
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.980]   matter. Your savings are going to be gone, and then you're going to have to go into debt
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.020]   or tap your 401(k), then what?
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.980]   Yeah, it's one of the most common things I hear from young people, is, "Why? I don't
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.660]   even know if I'm going to live. My uncle died at 50. Why am I saving all this money for
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.900]   a day I might not even reach?" But, yeah, I guess that's kind of what makes life difficult
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:15.300]   to plan for, right? It doesn't mean you shouldn't plan at all, but yeah, shit happens sometimes.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.900]   But, it doesn't mean that --
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.300]   All right, Duncan, if you could plan it out, what's the perfect age to die for you? This
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.300]   is kind of morbid, but --
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:33.620]   I mean, I guess it's all relative to in what good shape you stay. I guess maybe 97? I don't
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.380]   want to be greedy and say 100. Maybe 97 is a good age?
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.780]   97? That seems pretty greedy to me. How many people live to 97? 85, 86, I think that's
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.780]   plenty for you.
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.780]   I would say 65.
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.220]   Well, all right.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.180]   Yeah, 97. I'd be happy with that.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.860]   By the way, first ever email we've got where someone predicted the date of their own death
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.900]   like decades in advance. So, kudos to you. Follow up with us in like 30 years and let
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.900]   us know if you're getting close.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.100]   Yeah, I feel like we need to watch a good comedy or something, you know?
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.100]   Yeah, maybe lighten up a little bit. But, yeah, let's do another one.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:11.340]   Yeah, hang in there. Okay, up next, we have a question from Joan. "I'm a 29-year-old marketer
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:17.240]   with a total annual comp of around $140,000. I've been aggressively investing for several
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.980]   years and maxing out my 401(k) and funding Roth IRA and brokerage accounts. I'm typically
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:28.420]   a buy and hold investor. But like many, I've seen a 25% decline in my total portfolio since
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.020]   December as I'm in aggressive and US-focused equities. If my portfolio declines as it has
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.780]   over the past six months, am I still getting the benefits of compounding? I don't think
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:44.780]   my brain fully comprehends the power of compounding." And we're here at the compound. This is perfect,
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.780]   right?
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.940]   Nice. I didn't even realize that. Great question from Joan here. I love this question because
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.100]   I think a lot of people have a hard time like figuring out compounding in their brain, right?
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.820]   We don't have the – it's not easy to think exponentially because that's really what compounding
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.220]   is. It's not just this linear thing. So, life would be much easier if we could just
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.300]   like we type into a retirement calculator and you say, "I'm going to get 9% or 10%
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   per year, year in and year out, and it's never going to change, and that's just going
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.260]   to make my life easier." But it doesn't work that way, especially in the stock market.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.760]   The worst part is that like even if you get 9% to 10%, which is guaranteed to no one,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.420]   that's what it's been in the past. Who knows if it's going to be that in the future?
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.140]   But it's not that easy. So, John, put up this first one. I said a very simple example.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.620]   Let's say you save $10,000 a year at the beginning of the year. You earn 10% a year
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.780]   because you put your money in the stock market. This is what it looks like on a line going
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.460]   up. And you can see the curve goes up. That's the exponential thing. But that's a really
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.380]   nice smooth line where you're just earning 10% every year. There's never any highs,
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.220]   never any lows. It just goes up. That's your retirement calculator. That's like putting
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.820]   it on a spreadsheet and life is easy, right? Unfortunately, life doesn't work like that.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.180]   So, interestingly enough, if we look at the last 30 years, from 1992 to 2021, to the end
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.060]   of 2021, the average return in the stock market on the S&P 500 was roughly 10%. It was a
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.260]   little more, but pretty darn close to 10%. So, let's do the next chart, John. And this
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.420]   one shows the actual experience of someone putting $10,000 into the stock market every
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.780]   year and seeing what happens. And you can see it's all over the place. In the early
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:15.460]   part of the decade, it jumped. That was the late '90s. Then you go to 2008 and it falls,
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.020]   right? And it's way below. And you can see that it's off of trend. We're talking like
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:26.620]   $200,000 below trend. Then we get to even the later years. It's like $400,000, $300,000
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.060]   before trend. And then at the end, you have this 10-year period where stocks go bonkers.
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.460]   And finally, in the stock market, that 10% is high. So, why does it work like that? Because
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.860]   you got pretty much the same 10% per year, right? That's the average return. But the
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.440]   stock market actually gave you higher returns. Well, a lot of it had to do with the timing
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.260]   of it. So, like, when did you save? The returns were bad at the beginning, but really great
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.980]   at the end. And the reason for this is that the stock market is lumpy, right? So, it's
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.980]   all over the place. That compounding, it happens in bursts. It doesn't happen all at once,
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:01.020]   or it's not consistent. So, these results could have been different where the stock
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.260]   market could have been below trend. Because if you had bad returns at the very end, it
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.580]   could have been even worse. So, a lot of it is due to timing and luck and how much you're
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.580]   saving and when you're saving. This is a very simple example. But let's look at the drawdown
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:17.860]   chart. This is since 1992 again. So, the last 30 years, if you look at the S&P 500 drawdown,
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:25.980]   we're talking return, I got separate losses of 11%, 19%, 12%, 12%, 50%, 15%, 57%, 16%,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.700]   19%, 13%, 10%, 20%, 34%, and then the current one, which at the worst point was like 19%
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:37.820]   down. So, you have all these drawdowns, double digits. And yet, the stock market is still
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.580]   up over 10% per year. You see, if you put $10,000 in each year, you're a multi-millionaire.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.380]   The thing is, compounding on a spreadsheet is really neat and tidy. Compounding the real
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.740]   world is very messy and lumpy. And unfortunately, it has to be this way because if there was
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.460]   no risk, there would be no returns.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:58.260]   Right. Yeah, that makes sense. We have David, a regular, in the chat saying it only works
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:04.180]   though if stocks recover. But that's like we were saying, you have bigger issues, right,
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:10.940]   if your diversified portfolio doesn't meaningfully come back ever. Is this like a what about
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.940]   Japan?
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.940]   Yes.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.780]   Yeah, Dave, you're blocked. Sorry. I'm kidding.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.820]   No, we won't, Dave.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:24.180]   I'm just kidding. But yeah, I think the compounding still is happening, but you better keep saving.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.060]   If you want the compounding to happen, you better save when it's down and not just when
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.820]   it's up. Because that's when the real compounding magic happens is when you're saving when stocks
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.340]   are down. Because when you have that catch-up period we talked about, when you break even,
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.840]   if you're not saving now and you decide, okay, I'm scared, I'm not going to save anymore,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.420]   that's when you really hurt yourself. If you're only saving when things feel good, it's not
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.420]   going to work as good.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.420]   Let's do another one.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.420]   Okay.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:53.780]   So up next we have a question from Jeff. "My wife and I are 55, no debt, two private colleges
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:59.140]   paid for, house worth $1 million." It sounds like this is a not to brag kind of thing,
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.140]   right?
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.140]   Geez, Jeff, not to brag.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:06.340]   "And $3.3 million in a 60/40 portfolio that we rebalance annually. We live below our means
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.740]   and spend about $100,000 a year. We plan to retire in two years, which means we put away
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:18.540]   another $280,000. Should we just go 40/60 or 30/70? Even if we're all in savings, we
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:23.420]   could live a long time. Add in Social Security and the fact that our kids expect nothing,
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.380]   it makes me wonder. Also, I would check with the kids, make sure they expect nothing."
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:36.100]   Yeah, they may want something. Keep that 60/40 going, mom and dad. This is really a financial
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.700]   planning question, because you're balancing all these things. There's the willingness
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.820]   to take risk, which is your appetite for risk. There's the need to take risk, like what returns
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.660]   are necessary to meet your objectives. Then there's the ability, like your current circumstances.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.540]   Let's bring in a financial planner to talk this one out. Taylor Hollis, who's been on
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.540]   the show before.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.540]   Hey, Taylor.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.540]   Hello.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.500]   So, Taylor, you have someone coming to you as a prospective client. They have a really
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.660]   nice nest egg. Everything sounds good. They're good at saving. They live below their means.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.420]   This is a picture-perfect client. But they say, "OK, this client probably technically
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.660]   has the ability to continue to take risk and build their portfolio and grow it, because
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.900]   they may have a few decades to ..." But they say, "What if we don't want to take a lot
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.980]   of risk? What if we just want to be defensive and protect everything we have?" How do you
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.100]   balance that out?
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:27.140]   Taylor: Yeah. Well, I would first say, they obviously have put themselves in a great situation.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:34.020]   They've saved a lot. They spend low relative to their asset size. So, they've put themselves
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.620]   in a great spot. This is a great "problem" to have. These are the type of scenarios I
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:46.740]   like to start with the end in mind. So, Duncan, you kind of alluded to it, but your kids might
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:52.020]   expect nothing, but does that mean that you want to leave them nothing? Is there a desire
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:57.960]   to leave something to future generations, maybe even your grandkids? Maybe you want
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:04.000]   to leave money to charity at your death. What's that kind of end goal? Sometimes it's hard
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.260]   to go there in your mind, because it feels so far-fetched. But I think that's a worthwhile
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:16.140]   exercise, because then you back into, "Okay, if we do have these goals to leave some sort
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.440]   of legacy once we're gone, that's going to drive how you should be allocated over these
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.100]   next 40 years or so for the rest of your lifetime."
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.020]   Lewis: At what point do you have the conversation of, "Hey, Jeff, you're doing great. What if
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.460]   you spent a little more money? What if you enjoyed yourself a little more and lived beyond
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.140]   your means a little bit? How do you bring that into this situation?"
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:41.420]   Jones: Right. That's kind of option two. Again, you're in this great situation. Theoretically,
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.900]   you could really ratchet down the risk on this portfolio. You could earn just 3% per
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:52.220]   year on this $3.3 million, and that gets you close to what you're spending each year. So,
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.340]   you have an ability to really ratchet down the risk. But, are there things that you would
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.400]   want to do more during your lifetime? Maybe you want to take your family on a big vacation
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.300]   every year. I don't know if there's grandkids in the picture yet, but if they come along
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.980]   one day, those family vacations might sound pretty nice. Maybe you want to ratchet up
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:16.820]   the charitable gifting during your lifetime. So, you're in a great spot with a lot of fun
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.560]   but difficult decisions to make. And that should drive, I believe, how you're allocated.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.900]   Lewis: And maybe you just shade a little bit. You go, "Instead of $30.70 or $40.60, let's
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.940]   go $50.50." You split the difference and see how that goes, right?
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.760]   Flippen: Yep. Not all or nothing. As we all know, it's dynamic, it's fluid. It sounds
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.640]   like you're rebalancing annually anyway, so you know that. And your goals might change.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.040]   A 40-year time period, and I'm using that number loosely, a lot's going to change in
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.000]   those 40 years. It's just about how you react to it.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.960]   Lewis: And the very question we're asking tells us a bit about their risk tolerance,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.840]   right? It's kind of indicative of what they're thinking.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.280]   Fletcher: Yeah. Sometimes I think that's the job of financial advisors, understanding
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.560]   your client and understanding if they really can't handle taking that risk, or they just
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.600]   don't want to, then it's your job to find a portfolio that works for them.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   Lewis: Right.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   Fletcher: Do another one, Duncan.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.520]   Duncan: We have people laughing in the chat about, like, "Oh, what a nice problem."
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.880]   Fletcher: Yeah. First world problems, but hey, everyone's different. Also, Jeff has
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.080]   no idea when he's going to die, so he could have a really long time around. He could live
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.420]   to be 97 like Duncan wants to, and then he does have 40 years.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:27.960]   Duncan: It's true. And these things are applicable to others, right? Not just people with that
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.960]   much money.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   Fletcher: Right.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.000]   Duncan: Even people that don't have that much money, they still may say, "I can't handle
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.360]   taking so much stock market risk. I need a more diversified portfolio, or defensive portfolio."
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.720]   What does that look like?
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   Fletcher: Right.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.760]   Duncan: All right, let's do another one.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:49.200]   Wathen: I like this one, because it has a compliment in it. "I'm a financial professional
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.240]   in my late 20s, and I just enrolled in my company's stock purchase plan. Their plan
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.840]   allows me to purchase stock at a 10% discount. I want to invest 20% of my paycheck and reduce
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.300]   it over time into the purchase plan. As I'm at a point where I'm financially confident
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.560]   to give up this much of my pay, does this seem wise? Should I drip the dividends, or
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.800]   use the dividends to buy other stock in my individual account? Thanks for all the quality
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   content."
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.880]   Fletcher: All right. Compliments will get you everywhere, right, Duncan?
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.880]   Duncan: Right.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.980]   Fletcher: This is a good one, because I think this is a hard one, because a lot of people
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.360]   think -- we always talk about the 401(k) match, and if you don't get that, you're leaving
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.120]   money on the table. But this is, "I have this discount in my company's stock plan at 10%,
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.040]   so why wouldn't I take as much as I can?" So, this person is going to save 20% of their
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.280]   paycheck. I don't know if they're going to do the 401(k) or not. But I guess the thought
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.320]   process here, Taylor, is thinking through, how much risk is too risk if you're working
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.560]   at the company and taking the stock? And then, how do you balance that discount, which is
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.760]   like, why would I turn that down, versus the need to diversify potentially?
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.800]   Taylor: Right, right. First, I want to applaud this listener on just the capacity that they
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:59.960]   have to save. I think that's great. Once again, a great problem to have, right? These stock
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:05.080]   purchase plans are really great benefits that some employers provide. And the first thing
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.560]   that I always caution people with on these is concentration. And Ben, you alluded to
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:15.440]   it a little bit. I'm not just talking about building up a significant stock position in
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:21.640]   one individual stock, but recognizing that your paycheck is coming from the same company
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.760]   that you're building a big stock position in. And if you're in your late 20s, your biggest
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:32.280]   asset right now, likely, is your human capital, your ability to earn an income for a significant
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.180]   period of time. And right now, that income's coming from the same company. So, just being
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:44.760]   very mindful of that concentration, both in your portfolio and in your income source.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:51.160]   But you alluded to it again, Ben, is the 10% discount feels like an immediate return. And
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.760]   in some ways, it is. But one thing, well, another thing to be mindful of is the tax
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:03.100]   implications of this. These stock purchase plans can have some pretty complex tax planning
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:08.520]   needs around them. Typically, you're looking at, on average, a two to three year holding
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.480]   period with these things to get the most tax benefit out of them before selling. Always
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.480]   consult with a CPA, with your tax professional, before making any moves. But if you're looking
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:25.960]   at this as a way to buy the stock, recognize that immediate 10% return, so to speak. Just
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.680]   know that there's a lot of tax implications if you were to turn around and sell it right
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   away.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.520]   Right. So, this isn't as easy as, from a tax perspective, as a 401(k) plan.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.220]   Absolutely not. No. Not a set it and forget it kind of thing.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.840]   Right. And the other thing is, you're earning a 10% discount. We've seen, in this past 18
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.280]   months or so, stocks can go down 10% in a day. Individual stocks, right? You can see
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:54.760]   that where that 10% discount is gone in a hurry. So, let's say this person, the only
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:00.440]   20% they're saving for retirement is this money. Just splitting it down the middle,
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.140]   maybe do 10 in this and get your discount, and put the other 10 in your 401(k), at least
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.960]   to have some semblance of balance. Because, you're right, if you're getting your income
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.600]   from them, it would be like owning your house and then buying shares in your house again.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.760]   You're doubling up, and it just seems like a lot of risk for your own local, personal
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   economy.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.760]   Exactly.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.240]   And then, if you get fired, then what?
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:31.560]   Then what? Something else to think about is, if this 20% wiggle room that you have is after
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.040]   you are already saving in your 401(k) up to the match, maybe split the difference between
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:43.320]   this purchase plan and just investing in a general, taxable, diversified account to offset
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.360]   this concentration that you might be building. And to further diversify your tax buckets
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.360]   too.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.400]   I have a question. Is there a lock-up when you're doing an employee purchase plan like
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.080]   this? Because otherwise, wouldn't someone figure out a way to arbitrage this, if you're
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.240]   getting a discount, and then you could just sell it on the market?
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:08.040]   I think that's why there's so many tax issues, is because they're trying to incentivize you
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.520]   not to do that. And I think each plan is a little different in how they're structured
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.760]   and the rules around them. So, you'd have to look into the plan specifics.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.120]   Yeah, unfortunately, the taxes would eat up that discount pretty quickly.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   Yep.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.760]   I'm always looking for an arbitrage opportunity.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:28.200]   Duncan's running a hedge fund on his company's retirement plan. Alright, keep those questions
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.000]   and comments coming. Remember, idontshop.com, we have the Portfolio Rescue Towels, red and
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   blue. Right, Duncan?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Right, yeah.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.240]   Yeah. I've been out in the lake all summer. I've got to get mine. I haven't used them
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.320]   yet. Duncan's going to go get it. Remember, if you have a question, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.840]   We always appreciate everyone in the comments. Look at that.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   Ah, there it is.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.680]   Nice. You got it backwards. That's pretty nice. It looks like a flag. It's very nice.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.120]   It's soft. I like those. Remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Thanks, Taylor, again, for coming out and
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.720]   helping. Thanks, Duncan, as always. And we will see everyone next week.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.240]   Thanks, everyone.
