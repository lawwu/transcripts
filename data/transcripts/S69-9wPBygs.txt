[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300]   So what do we got? What's our first question, Jesse?
[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.640]   Hi, the first question is from Julian.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.780]   Julian says, I intend in university for a brief period
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.180]   to get a degree in film, but dropped out.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.300]   I want to be a screenwriter,
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.140]   but I currently work in the service industry.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.800]   So my days can be long and tiresome.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.080]   At 20 years old, I feel incredibly behind in my writing.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.080]   Was dropping out of university a bad decision?
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.380]   Well, Julian, first of all, I think dropping out or not dropping out.
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.880]   This is a red herring when it comes to the specific question of screenwriting
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.540]   and jumpstarting your screenwriting career.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.480]   I think there's a lot to be discussed about dropping out of college,
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.640]   whether you should or shouldn't.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.500]   But I don't think it really matters either way, good or bad.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.200]   When it comes to this very specific question of
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.500]   are you behind in your screenwriting career and what would you need to do?
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.980]   So I'm not a screenwriter myself.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.300]   I don't have a specific background in it.
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700]   I am a big fan of movies.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.200]   I am a big fan of the movie industry. I know screenwriters.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.540]   I'm going to try to pull together from stuff
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.040]   I have learned to try to offer you some advice here.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.040]   I have two things to recommend, Julian.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.840]   One, surround yourself.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.940]   By other artists.
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.340]   I think this is critical in the movie industry,
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.400]   particularly if you're going to be a screenwriter, you have to be around
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.040]   other people with high artistic aspirations in this field.
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.480]   If you're trying to do this in isolation,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.880]   this how do I write a movie that gets made?
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.580]   You're going to produce things that are formulaic.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.880]   You're not going to find traction.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.340]   You have to aim incredibly high and be around people
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980]   who are really pushing themselves.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.820]   You see this again and again.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.080]   When you look back through the personal stories, in particular of directors
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.420]   or director writers that that really break out.
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.580]   They're surrounded by other
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.840]   aspirational film industry types.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.720]   They're pushing each other.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.580]   They're learning from each other.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.020]   They have big aims.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.240]   I'm just reading right now a Francis Ford Coppola
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.740]   or Coppola, Coppola, Coppola
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.420]   biography and about that generation of filmmakers.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.120]   They came from various places, but they were all with each other.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.680]   So he had George Lucas.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.840]   They were very he was very close with George Lucas.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.720]   And then that crew met up with the USC crew.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.880]   So you had, you know, Scorsese.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.640]   You had Brian De Palma.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.580]   Then they connected with Spielberg, who didn't didn't get in the USC,
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540]   but also had a deal with Universal at, you know, 19.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.340]   So it didn't really matter.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.780]   So it's Spielberg at the Palma.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.880]   You have Scorsese, Coppola.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.900]   You had Lucas.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.040]   They're all hanging out and pushing each other and
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.940]   working with each other.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.080]   And out of that came, you know, really interesting,
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.980]   really interesting work.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.280]   JJ Abrams has a sort of interesting similar story.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.420]   So surround yourself by other artists, people who are obsessed with this.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.480]   I just went down a
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.540]   a PTA rabbit hole, Paul Thomas Anderson rabbit hole.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.320]   Same thing.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.520]   You see him at Sundance Labs as a really young, really young filmmaker
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.580]   just surrounded by all of this talent to surround yourself by talent.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.620]   If you're not, it's not going to work.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.180]   And then when you write aim really high, does the other thing I picked up,
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.080]   even with screenwriters that you associate
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.820]   later on with this seems like a commercial blockbuster movie.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.680]   So if we're thinking, I'm thinking JJ Abrams, maybe go back
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.220]   and think about John Milius.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.520]   They were artistically really ambitious,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.780]   and they were working on and they would work on scripts
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.020]   that were really stretches novelistic,
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.780]   literary, interesting nuance of character and pacing.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.120]   Your your produced works are going to fall below where you're aiming.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.620]   So if you come into the industry thinking like, how do I write an action movie
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.060]   like one I just saw, like a Marvel movie or something,
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.820]   you're going to fall below that standard and do nothing.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.460]   But when you come into the industry with interesting artistic stuff,
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.060]   you show real skill.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.260]   That is what is going to develop your skill.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.480]   That's what's going to catch attention,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.060]   even if the things you end up getting produced later are farther down the ladder.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.380]   Now, 50 percent of what I'm saying here, Julian, might be nonsense.
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.780]   Again, I'm not in the movie industry.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.980]   I did, though, have an interesting conversation once with
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.360]   the head of story at Paramount.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.660]   So it was someone who doesn't write scripts,
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.060]   but helps develop all the scripts that Paramount is actually going to work on.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.920]   And I learned a lot from that conversation.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.520]   But basically, you have to be if you're going to succeed in screenwriting,
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.920]   people have to see you as having this spark, this artistic genius.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.060]   Right. And then they're happy to have some with an artistic genius,
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.980]   you know, right.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.620]   Take a hack at the next Guardian of the Galaxy franchise.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.060]   But you got to you have to come in with this spark.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.280]   So aim really high.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.920]   Be very aspirational, very ambitious.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.320]   Surround yourself with other artists.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.360]   That's what matters.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.480]   Whether you dropped out of college or not,
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.280]   doesn't matter for that specific thing.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.620]   So that'd be my advice.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.480]   How would you suggest that Julian balances it with his service industry job?
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.820]   Like, say, say he works some nights, he might work some doubles, stuff like that.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.060]   I mean, go back and read a bunch of Tarantino oral histories.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.520]   That's a good one. A lot of early interviews with Tarantino.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.700]   Find out about how he was crafting his scripts
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.360]   when working at the famous was the video.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.920]   What was it called?
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.860]   You said the video store.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.220]   But I don't remember the exact name of the video store.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.660]   I think that's a good example.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.260]   Kevin Smith is another good example of people who were honing this skill
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.560]   while just working in a service industry.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.500]   Tarantino is where I'm going to point you, actually, Julian,
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.020]   if you really want to see that what I'm talking about in action,
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   because he was obsessed with film, obsessed with it, watching everything,
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.520]   tracking down where the weird prints were.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.360]   This art house across town is playing, you know, some early Kurosawa there.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.860]   You know, I want to see, you know, Hitchcock's rope,
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.060]   which is not really widely played,
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.060]   but there's maybe an interesting print happening over here.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.060]   He was obsessed with film and that obsession with film drove it.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.120]   He had a service industry job.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.180]   He's working at a video store doing other odd jobs.
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.660]   And that's when he also started writing.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.720]   By the way, look at Tarantino's rise.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.580]   He did a lot of script work early on
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.220]   with some pretty major blockbuster type films.
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.820]   I'm blanking on what some of the names are now, but films
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.620]   you would remember from the early the mid 90s films
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.060]   that were just straight up like Nicolas Cage action films.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.380]   He would call they would call him in to work on those things, which again shows.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.060]   The writers who work are artistically ambitious.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.860]   Even if not everything they work on itself is artistically ambitious.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.700]   So use use Tarantino, I think, is a good case study.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.900]   You're 20, you have energy.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.660]   So if you get obsessed and let that obsession drive you.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.700]   You can you have the time you have the time.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   [Music]
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.200]   (upbeat music)
