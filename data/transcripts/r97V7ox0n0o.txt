[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Well, what's the point of my life?
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.520]   That was the question we asked and answered on Monday.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.800]   And we talked about our joy in God and God's glory being united together
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.860]   in one unifying vision of existence.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.800]   Now, today we feel the question about joy from a listener named
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.100]   Shannon, who writes to say this.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.160]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.740]   I attended the most recent cross conference.
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.680]   There you said something that struck me.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.520]   You said that your hope for us students is for there to be young people
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.800]   who are "joyfully serious."
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.640]   Can you explain this more?
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.580]   And what does this look like, particularly in everyday life?
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.840]   What does it look like to be joyfully serious?
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.200]   Well, now, how shall I come at this?
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.720]   It touches on so many things.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.240]   In fact, the more I thought about it, the more I thought I should write a book on
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.240]   this, I should I should write a book called Joyful Seriousness or Serious
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.200]   Joy or something to try to capture the paradox of what I mean by this.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.320]   What I'm trying to get at when I say joyful seriousness is a life that has
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.960]   been made serious because of the unspeakably awesome realities of God
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.120]   and sin and heaven and hell and the cross of Christ and the necessity of faith
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.240]   and the essential reality of holiness.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.080]   If we are to obtain heaven, in other words, the great realities of life are
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.120]   enormously serious and weighty and glorious and beautiful and awesome and
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.840]   deep and high, they are of such a nature that to treat them in a glib or
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.080]   superficial or trifling or trivial way is an utter contradiction.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.160]   And within and under and flowing out of the weight and the wonder of these great
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.920]   realities, there is what the Bible calls joy, unspeakable and full of glory,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.880]   which is as different from the slapstick and silliness and cleverness of so much
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.920]   Christian so-called banter and worship as lightning is from the lightning bug.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.720]   Charles Spurgeon gets at it like this.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.560]   He said, some of us must conquer some of us, especially our tendency to levity.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.120]   A great distinction exists between holy cheerfulness, which is a virtue, and that
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.640]   general levity, which is a vice.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.040]   There is a levity which has not enough heart to laugh, but trifles with
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.800]   everything.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.680]   It is a flippant, hollow, unreal thing.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.480]   A hearty laugh is no more levity than a hearty cry.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.040]   My concern is that at least three things conspire today to threaten the joy and
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.160]   seriousness of this generation.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.760]   One is our native sinfulness as human beings, which tends to make light things
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.520]   heavy and heavy things light because it is by nature deception and blind.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.120]   And we're always turning things upside down and getting them backwards.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.960]   So that's the first thing.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.480]   My own sinful nature inclines me to make light of weighty things and to make
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.920]   weighty, superficial things.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.160]   The other is the comfort of the Western world.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.640]   Most people in the West know very little about the basic hardships of life, which
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.600]   make life really serious for most people.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.800]   Life where you have to walk miles to get fresh water.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.600]   You have to chop wood to have heat in the wintertime.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.960]   You have to cook your food if you're going to eat over a fire that you collect
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.760]   wood for.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.200]   There's no modern medical care, no food unless you grow it yourself.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   No indoor plumbing, no refrigeration, no police protection.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.680]   No clothing unless you make it.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:47.800]   No mention of TV or smartphones or iPads or computers or radios and no access to
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   books by and large.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.440]   This is the way most of the centuries of the world, new things, new life.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   And it's the way millions and millions of people live today.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.920]   My wife and I are watching a documentary, actually a fictionalized documentary
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.440]   called The Emigrants of the Swedish Emigrants in the 1850s, about a five hour
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.040]   thing.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:17.960]   And what overwhelms me is just how incredibly hard life was in winter Sweden
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.800]   or winter Minnesota, where they immigrated to when everything had to be provided
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.760]   for themselves out of the ground or out of the out of the frozen lake or out of
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.240]   the cow that may or may not continue to give some milk if you had one for the
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.360]   children during the winter.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.120]   Life was just hard.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.520]   But we today, we take all these things for granted and therefore we are
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.680]   complainers out of the womb for the slightest little thing.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.600]   And what we consider hardship is a computer whose Internet speed drops below
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.280]   25 megabits a second.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.960]   This this makes for a very superficial kind of people who have little
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.360]   relationship to the threats of life and especially the ones that were just
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   common in other generations.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.960]   And then you add to that.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.080]   And this is my third thing, the the ever present entertainment industry on your
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.440]   phone or your iPad or your TV or your computer or the movie theater, which
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.800]   everybody takes for granted.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.640]   Everybody talks about incessantly and most of the talking is is is clever.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.240]   It's repartee, it's banter.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.880]   And all of this together produces a kind of life that results in a superficial,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:44.400]   trivial, clever, Christian banter shaped for the Twitter sphere and crafted for
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.720]   spreading on Facebook.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.720]   But I don't think we can do real evangelism on the basis of this kind of
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.000]   ubiquitous levity.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.240]   It's almost impossible to shift from a posture of levity to a posture that takes
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.720]   hell seriously and sheds tears over someone's lostness.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.160]   It's almost impossible to walk into a worship service and suddenly switch off a
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:20.680]   whole lifestyle of silliness and try to become a reverent person before an all
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.880]   holy God, when everything else in life has been training us to be glib and trite
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.280]   and superficial.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.160]   And worse, many worship services have simply adapted to the superficiality of
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.080]   the media culture and tried to turn Christianity into something that fits
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:47.800]   this with a ever funnier approach to the great things of God, which doesn't work.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.040]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.320]   It doesn't fit.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.600]   Or another way to come at it is to say that I have a burden that we have lost our
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.880]   grip on what it means to be human, the glory of being human.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.080]   It's it's not just that evangelism is made difficult and worship is made almost
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.600]   impossible and God is made almost inconceivable in his true greatness.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.320]   But the glory of being human is made thinner and thinner as we become cute and
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   clever about things that don't really matter.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:26.080]   While the depth and the wonder of being created in God's image and living for his
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.240]   glory and being transformed into his image someday, all that just fades away.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:39.120]   So what I'm lamenting when I plead for joyful seriousness is that it seems to me
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:47.120]   the pendulum has swung so far in one direction that we are far more adept at
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.640]   humor than tears.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:56.400]   The Apostle Paul spoke of sinners in Philippians 3, 18 like this, of whom I
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:03.800]   tell you weeping that they are enemies of the cross, whose end is destruction and
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.400]   whose mind is set on earthly things.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.600]   Without that weeping, there will never be, I think, the revival that we need today
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.240]   in America. No lasting spiritual renewal without that kind of seriousness.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:29.680]   What would happen to a congregation if a pastor with all earnestness and gravity
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:37.600]   and love and joy would begin his Easter sermon with all those guests present, not
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.160]   with a joke or a cute story, but with the words of John Donne to his congregation on
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:51.680]   Easter Sunday morning when he said, "What sea could furnish my eyes with tears
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.280]   enough to pour out if I should think that of all this congregation which looks me in
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:05.320]   the face now, I should not meet one at the resurrection at the right hand of God?"
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:14.080]   Well, that's a flavor of what I meant by saying joyful seriousness.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.600]   There's so much more, but that's probably enough for now.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.840]   So good. That's a great and perceptive question, Shannon.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.680]   Thank you for sending it in, and thank you for the response, Pastor John.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.200]   That's really, really insightful.

[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.200]   Well, one of the ministries God has given to Desiring God is in a really focused way,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.560]   is caring for parents of disabled children.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.040]   When the news initially hits, often very suddenly, how should
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.600]   this sudden news be processed?
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.680]   Pastor John will delicately lead us through the stages that parents often face when
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.720]   they're faced with a disabled child.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.720]   Don't miss this episode.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   It's sobering.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.080]   It's humbling.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.960]   It is pastoral.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.360]   Don't miss it.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.920]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.760]   We'll see you back here on Friday with longtime author and Pastor John Piper.
