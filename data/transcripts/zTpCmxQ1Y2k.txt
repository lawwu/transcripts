[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.660]   what do we know about the way to let emotion out and through and what do we know about
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.680]   healthy adaptive compartmentalization as skills and here I'm hoping that perhaps people can glean
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:24.600]   some tools like take an hour a day and let it wail take two hours a day and handle your stuff
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.480]   yeah I think it is helpful to remember that emotions are actually the output they're the
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:43.000]   product it isn't so much that we have to figure out how to deal with emotions although I will come
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.240]   back and say that differently in a moment we have to figure out how to handle what physical and mental
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.520]   state resulted in those emotions so what I mean by that is if you are in a moment
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:07.580]   where everything in your body is in protest you are amped up and you can't sit still
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:16.120]   then working with your body right maybe you are the person who needs to go for a run
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.200]   every day where that hasn't really been who you were before right uh on the other hand
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.440]   maybe you're the person who needs to develop a yoga practice to figure out how to breathe through
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:42.360]   that amped up feeling and soothe yourself physically soothe yourself so that you can
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.560]   bring your heart rate down right so those are two entirely different behaviors but I can tell you
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.880]   at the end of either of them your body's going to be in a different state and I bet your emotions
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.560]   are in a different state too right so there's one way to think about it which is coming at how do we
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.800]   handle the emotions but there's another way to come at it which is how do I handle all of the demands
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.200]   and resources I have when demands and resources get out of balance that stress so how do I increase
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.840]   the resources in my life how do I reduce the demands in my life because I am suddenly in a really difficult
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.000]   situation so that's one way to think about it we did an intervention study in my lab with widows and widowers
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.200]   where one arm uh received mindfulness training another arm received progressive muscle relaxation
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.360]   which is sort of like learning a really fancy body scan you contract and relax different
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.920]   muscle groups in your body and you become aware of what that feels like to really understand what
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.320]   relaxation feels like and then there was a weightless control group and we did it because the progressive
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.840]   muscle relaxation was the control group we thought mindfulness training would be very helpful
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.400]   turns out mindfulness training was helpful but progressive muscle relaxation was even more
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.440]   helpful for people's grief so what does this practice look like it's a it's you're tensing your
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.520]   fists them relaxing then forearms them so working through uh head to toe contracting for about
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.200]   how long i'm just trying to get the rough contour yeah it's a brief contraction it's you know you can
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.560]   go online there's really easy instructions it's often done with a sort of guided uh audio um to help you
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.720]   figure out but the important part is also feeling what what's the difference between my clenched fist
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.360]   and my relaxed fist oh gosh i didn't even realize i was had so much muscle tension right so what's
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.800]   fascinating is people told us in any situation i'm in the grocery store i'm in a work meeting i'm trying to fall
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:06.440]   fall asleep i can use this tool now to help my body to get into a different state and that helps my
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.080]   grief now mindfulness training was effective but not as effective as i said and i think some of this is
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.200]   that we have you know grieving is a form of learning i'm not kidding about that your brain is busy while you
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.040]   you are grieving and it might not be the right time to take up a new practice that requires a lot of
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.600]   concentration if you do mindfulness it can be very helpful anyway the upshot of all that is on the one
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.360]   hand it's not that we have to deal with emotions because they are an output we have to deal with our
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:47.800]   demands and our resources and uh developing a whole toolkit of ways to think about adapting in our life now on the
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:56.040]   other hand even specifically for waves of grief having a toolkit of what to do with those emotions
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.120]   i think you described it beautifully andrew that we do have the capacity for suppression
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.440]   and if you are about to walk into a pitch meeting suppression is probably the way to go in that moment
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.320]   where suddenly your deceased child has popped into your head and thinking i am not going to think about
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.480]   this right now i am completely going to pretend this has not happened and i'm going to do this pitch
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:32.760]   right but if it's your only strategy then you don't have the learning process going on right that at another
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:41.480]   moment you might be looking through a photo album and just be overcome with tears but over time realize
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:51.880]   i can't say stay in that puddle either when i'm doing this i need to you know if it was me i need to text my
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:59.720]   sister and tell her you know i'm looking at photos of mom and this is what i'm thinking about and she'll text me some
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:07.000]   funny story about mom or or even just say oh man i feel ya and if my sister isn't available then i'll
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.480]   text my best friend right because in that moment it is important to have that puddle it's also important
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.760]   important to know how to get out of the puddle again and so this is really a process of learning how do i
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.840]   cope with these waves of grief it's like being a basketball player one possession after another after
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.760]   another how am i going to get through this possession each possession looks different how am i going to get
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:47.160]   through this possession with this constellation what's the right skill to use right now
