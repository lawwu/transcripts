[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.000]   I'm currently on sabbatical, which is why I haven't been recording many episodes.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.560]   But I've been spending a lot of time with my insurance company, updating my umbrella
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.720]   policy and my auto insurance policy and my homeowner's insurance policy.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.000]   And I think all of you guys have to do the same thing as well.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560]   We've been in a bull market, a surprising bull market that has lifted our returns in
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.520]   the stock market, bond market, real estate market, cryptos, whatever it is, since the
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.720]   beginning of 2020.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.960]   And I'm assuming that most of you guys are much wealthier now, or at least have all time
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.900]   high net worth since the start of 2020.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.520]   As a result, we need to update our insurance policies to protect ourselves, to protect
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.560]   our wealth, and to protect our family members.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.920]   Let's first talk about the umbrella policy, which sits on top of your auto insurance and
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400]   homeowner's insurance policies.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.480]   For example, let's say you get into an automobile accident and cause bodily harm to a pedestrian.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.760]   The pedestrian sees that you drive a fancy 7 Series BMW that costs $90,000 and decides
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.320]   to sue you for $500,000.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.440]   The irony is that if you drove a beater car, the pedestrian might have only sued you for
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.880]   $50,000 or nothing at all.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.120]   So this is an important reminder that there are some big downsides to having nice things
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.120]   that the public can see.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.320]   So in this situation, when he decides to sue you for $500,000, your auto insurance policy
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.840]   has a $300,000 liability coverage with a $1,000 deductible, for example.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   And let's say you have a million dollar umbrella policy with a $300,000 deductible.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.380]   So if the pedestrian successfully wins the $500,000 lawsuit, your umbrella policy kicks
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.720]   in to cover the remaining $200,000 over your $300,000 auto insurance liability.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   So why is this important?
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.880]   Well, it's important because let's say you spend 20 years to build a net worth of $500,000.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.640]   Well, you need the auto insurance liability coverage and it's great to have that umbrella
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   policy to protect you because you don't want to go backwards.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.000]   You want to go back to zero.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.500]   The reality is accidents happen all the time, whether it is your fault or not.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.680]   Just having this lawsuit bear on top of you is really, really stressful.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.360]   So having this umbrella policy provides a tremendous amount of peace of mind.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.760]   We always want to be going forward on our financial journey, not backwards.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.880]   So let me share more examples of why you should get an umbrella policy if you're not convinced.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.080]   The first example or situation is if you have a teenager or multiple teenagers at home.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.140]   An umbrella policy covers members of your household.
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.720]   So all the members of your household.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.100]   So if you have more members of your household who are going out into society and risking
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.920]   doing funny things, your risk of an accident goes up.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.960]   Having teenagers, I think, is the biggest one.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.120]   It puts your household at significantly higher risk of liability.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.880]   Not only are they inexperienced drivers, they sometimes experiment with drugs, alcohol,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.500]   and all these other things that impair their judgment.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.640]   And accidents do happen.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.760]   I remember when I was a teenager in high school, I tried a ton of stupid things.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.880]   I remember one time after tennis practice, there was a tennis teammate of mine and he
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.280]   smoked marijuana and he drove.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.520]   And it was pretty dangerous because he drove right through a red light.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.720]   And who knows what could have happened if there was another car.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.480]   We could have t-boned the car or that car could have t-boned us.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.120]   A lot of injuries could have happened and our households could have been sued.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.360]   So really, if you have a teenager driving around everywhere, you got to get an umbrella
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.380]   policy because your teenager could literally bankrupt you.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.240]   The second example of why you need an umbrella policy is if you plan to retire early with
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.720]   young children.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   One of the reasons why I've been saving and investing so much, especially during the pandemic
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.880]   since we've been locked down, is that I want to make more passive income.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.360]   So if there's a lawsuit where I lose a chunk of my wealth, that means I lose a chunk of
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.720]   my passive income.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.320]   And what's the point of my passive income?
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.200]   The point of my passive income is so I can spend time with my children before they don't
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.120]   want to spend any time with me.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.680]   I know I've got until at most 18 years old until they no longer want to hang out with
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   me.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.200]   In reality, to the parents that I've talked to, my kids probably won't want to hang out
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.160]   with me after, I don't know, 13 or 14 years old.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.760]   They want to hang out with their friends.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   Therefore, for me, having an umbrella policy is really about protecting the time I want
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.020]   to spend with my young children.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.880]   And so for you, you've got to translate what that money and that passive income means to
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   you.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.620]   What do you want to do with your time and your money?
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.620]   That is really what an umbrella policy will help protect.
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.120]   Another example of why you might need an umbrella policy is if you're a multiple tenant landlord.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.280]   The more properties you have, the more you run a risk of messing something up with your
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   tenant.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.280]   Who knows?
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   Things happen all the time.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.380]   You don't know exactly what is functioning in your property, even though everything could
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.760]   be done up to code and to permits.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.280]   Maybe an electrical wire sparks fire and catches flame to the insulation and the house burns
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   down.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.220]   You just don't really know.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.520]   What you should do, obviously, is make sure that all your tenants have a renter's insurance
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.840]   policy and have a really, really solid lease that describes what happens in case of certain
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   events.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   But at the end of the day, you just don't know.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.860]   Another example of why you need an umbrella policy is if you're a small business owner
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.120]   who sells a physical product or if you're a doctor.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.520]   If you talk to any doctors out there, man, their liability medical malpractice insurance
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.520]   is a lot.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.240]   It squeezes their profitability.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.600]   It's one of the reasons why I think health care costs are so high.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.140]   Let's say you operate a chocolate store and one of your employees has a psychotic breakdown.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.800]   He decides to beat up a customer who is extremely rude and impatient.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.720]   Well, that customer, let's say he injures his neck or something, could sue you for negligence
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.560]   and that's where an umbrella policy would protect you.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.700]   Or maybe you run a restaurant that is already struggling to survive thanks to COVID.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.340]   To boost revenue, you open an outdoor dining area where cars used to park on the street.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.640]   You see that everywhere in big cities now.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.240]   Less parking, but more outside areas for dining for safety.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.540]   Then one unfortunate evening, a car barrels down through the outdoor dining area causing
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.420]   injuries to your diners.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.800]   If the diner decides to sue you, well, that's where the umbrella policy kicks in beyond
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.400]   your business insurance.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.320]   And finally, if you're a high profile individual, let's say you're a celebrity, politician,
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:34.240]   sports star, any type of high profile individual, getting an umbrella policy is very important.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   Risk is a numbers game.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.800]   The more people who know you, the greater the chance that someone might sue you, whether
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.280]   you did something or not.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.160]   You know, it's a lot of he said, he said, or he said, she said, or whatever.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.800]   You just never really know.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.280]   So it's another vote for stealth wealth, being modest, being kind to people, and just not
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.920]   getting into too many conflicts.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.080]   Now maybe after you've listened so far, you're still not convinced you need an umbrella policy.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   Well, that's true.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.500]   Not everybody needs or wants one.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.520]   If you are driving a car, you probably have auto liability insurance.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.980]   Or if you own a home, you have homeowners insurance policy with liability coverage.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.500]   So if your net worth is below the liability coverage of your auto insurance policy or
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.340]   homeowners insurance policy, then perhaps you don't need an umbrella policy.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:29.200]   Now let's say you drive a $40,000 Ford F-150 and you earn $70,000 a year.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.360]   You're also married and have no children yet.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.320]   And you've got credit card debt and you've got car loan debt.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.360]   And at age 30, your net worth is about $70,000.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.720]   Well, if your auto insurance policy liability coverage is $100,000, well, you're covered
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   in case of an accident.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.200]   So you don't need an umbrella policy.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.400]   But in general, you should have an umbrella policy that is equal to slightly more than
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.680]   your current net worth because over time, your net worth tends to grow.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.480]   Just look at your own net worth over the past six months, one year, two years, five years,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.600]   10 years.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.320]   It's generally growing bit by bit as you save more and your investments do better.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.840]   So you want to have that little buffer.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.080]   At the same time, you don't want to have too large of an umbrella policy because too large
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.120]   of an umbrella policy might attract a lot more unwanted attention.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.240]   Personal injury lawyers have the easy ability to figure out what your assets are.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.240]   You just go to court.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.320]   They summoned you in court.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.160]   They ask you what your assets are.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.860]   And boom, you got to tell the truth because you're under oath.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.760]   And if you have, let's say, a $500,000 net worth, but a $5 million umbrella policy equal
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.840]   to 10 times your net worth, well, I think the personal injury lawyer will be more motivated
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.080]   to say that you inflicted way more damage and suffering than reality and go after more
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.480]   of that liability coverage.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.760]   Besides, if you get too high of an umbrella policy, you're paying unnecessary premiums.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.360]   And speaking of umbrella policy premiums, it's not that expensive, folks.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.000]   I just checked with my insurance carriers and a couple more.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.520]   And for my household, two driving household, it's only about $150 to $200 a year per million
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.160]   dollars of umbrella policy coverage.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:17.720]   Now, I've seen other surveys that go up to like $300 to $500 per year per million.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.440]   It depends on how big your household coverage is, how many products you have with that one
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   insurance company.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.160]   So if you want to save on your umbrella policy or all your other insurance policies, you
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.480]   should probably bundle your auto, your personal belongings, homeowners, umbrella, and so forth,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.800]   all with one carrier.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.640]   It's more efficient, first of all, and the carrier will probably give you a discount
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.120]   for being a multiple product customer.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.560]   Now, there's something very important to consider that a Financial Samurai reader gave.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.600]   He's an attorney, but he's not your attorney.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.920]   So ask your attorney for professional advice.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:59.840]   But what if there's a situation where someone hits you or kills you and they are underinsured
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.640]   or don't have insurance?
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.040]   Then what?
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.160]   So the reader said, well, you should consider getting an umbrella underinsured motorist
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.720]   coverage, UIM.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.840]   This gives you umbrella UIM protection above the regular UIM limit you have on your policy.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.680]   He says normal umbrella coverage only covers the injuries of people you injure through
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.640]   your negligence.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.920]   The more likely scenario is that you and your family are injured by someone else.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.580]   The average liability coverage that drivers have is only about $50,000 and many drive
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.720]   without insurance.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.120]   Losing your family of three is hit by a driver with only $50,000 in coverage, killing the
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.920]   main breadwinner and seriously disabling the other two.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.600]   In a normal scenario, you would be limited to recovering the $50,000 and whatever UIM
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.640]   coverage you have on your regular policy, say $300,000.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.440]   So a total recovery of $350,000 would not even begin to cover the lifetime of lost earnings
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:06.480]   for the deceased and the daily in-home nursing care for the disabled.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.240]   Umbrella UIM would kick in above the $350,000 and provide your family another million or
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.240]   more in coverage.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.000]   As an attorney, the most common scenario I see is that there is rarely enough insurance
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.240]   coverage to cover the losses in a serious accident.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   Wow.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.920]   All this time, we've been thinking about what we might do wrong to cause an accident, but
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.560]   we didn't think about what other people might do to us.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.640]   And in this crazy big world of ours, not everybody is as responsible as us.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   Some just don't have insurance or some just have the state required minimum.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.560]   And let's say you make, I don't know, $200,000 a year and you're dead.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:52.800]   What is your family going to do if the underinsured motorist pays nothing or only has $50,000
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.200]   in auto liability coverage?
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.280]   $50,000 is not going to get your family very far at all.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.440]   So I immediately, after reading this comment, called my insurance carrier and said, "Hey,
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.960]   do you have the Umbrella UIM that I could pay for?"
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.960]   And they said, "No."
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.040]   They said, "No, unfortunately."
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.440]   And you should check your own carriers and see if they have that.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:21.360]   So the solution I came up with, that we came up with, is to increase my auto insurance
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.200]   liability coverage, which also increases my uninsured bodily protection coverage.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.680]   It's a one-for-one increase.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.840]   So I had $300,000 and $500,000.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:40.040]   $300,000 per person and $500,000 per accident in terms of bodily injury coverage or uninsured
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.200]   motor liability coverage.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:50.760]   So my solution was to simply raise that uninsured liability coverage from $300,000 to $500,000
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.080]   to $1,000,000.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:59.600]   So in this case, if I were to die in an accident and it was not my fault, but an uninsured
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.400]   or underinsured motorist killed me, then hopefully my family will get $1,000,000.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.640]   So it's $1,000,000, $1,000,000, so $1,000,000 per person and $1,000,000 total for the accident.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.240]   And that's the best that my insurance carrier could do.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.800]   I feel better about getting this new policy.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.000]   It only costs me an extra $25 every six months.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   So to me, that's a no-brainer.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.880]   However, unfortunately, it's not an automatic that my family will get $1,000,000.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.280]   Just like with any kind of insurance policy that is at this level, it's going to require
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.060]   a lot more involvement with the lawyers and so forth.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.940]   But I'm hopeful that the policy will pay out and protect my family.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.200]   And finally, the other solution to this type of unfortunate scenario is to get an appropriate
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.920]   amount of life insurance.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.520]   The appropriate amount of life insurance is probably a term life insurance policy that
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:57.000]   covers all your debt and covers all your family's expenses until your kids become independent
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.040]   adults.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.200]   So that's about it, folks.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.160]   I hope this episode has encouraged you to review your umbrella policy, auto insurance
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.700]   policy, homeowner's insurance policy, and any other type of insurance policy.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.480]   This bull market has been a real boon for us investors.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.520]   However, we need to protect our wealth and we need to protect our family.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.400]   The more money we have, the more we have to lose.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.580]   And if you are a parent, it is our ultimate responsibility to protect our children and
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.580]   our family.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.580]   Thank you very much.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.880]   And if you enjoyed this episode, I'd love a positive review on wherever you listen to
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.120]   this podcast.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.120]   Take care, everyone.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.120]   And I'll try to do more episodes.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.560]   But again, I'm still on sabbatical until the end of August.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.840]   And then I should have some more free time.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.480]   But for now, I'm trying to enjoy life a little bit more.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.940]   I went up to Sonoma to spend time with my family and it was so awesome.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.040]   Take a vacation, folks, if you can.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.100]   Get out of the city.
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.360]   Go to a place where there's not a lot of people.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.200]   I really believe your mental and physical health will improve.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.560]   It'll tick upwards as it has for me.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.560]   Thanks again, everyone.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:01.560]   Take care.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.400]   Take care.
