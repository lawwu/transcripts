[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   Rob Smith joins us one more time.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.120]   Rob is a theologian who lectures in systematic theology and ethics at Sydney Missionary and
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.880]   Bible College in Australia.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.400]   He also serves as honorary assistant minister at St. Andrew's Anglican Cathedral in Sydney.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.960]   He approaches the topic of transgender revolution as a biblical theologian, a historian of the
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.240]   movement and as a pastor whose own family has been touched by the realities and the
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.960]   tensions of gender dysphoria.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.400]   We close out the week talking about transgenderism, which is somewhat of a misleading term.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.440]   I mean, biologically for a transition of a male to a female or of a female to a male,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.000]   Rob, what cannot happen physically?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.640]   I mean, what will simply not be able to happen to the body in a transition?
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.280]   I'm thinking of a male to female transition, which would not bring with it monthly cycles
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.760]   or a womb or a biological clock.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.880]   So what biological functions are simply not transferable between the genders?
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.080]   Yes, now here you're stretching my knowledge of current medical possibilities and even
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.280]   what's being attempted as we speak.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.920]   Obviously, I think one of the key words in what you just said is the word natural.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.880]   It's certainly not possible to create a natural biological clock in a man or for a womb to
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.400]   naturally develop.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.240]   However, there is, well, I believe there are attempts going on to work out how to transplant
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240]   wombs.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.160]   In fact, I think even this year it happened in the case of a woman who couldn't conceive
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.160]   from one.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.120]   I can't remember the details, but basically her mother's womb, the uterus was transplanted
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.280]   into the daughter so the daughter could carry the child.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.600]   So there are those who are trying to work out how can we transplant a womb into a man.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.800]   And it's easy for us at this point to think how ridiculous that's impossible, but of course
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.400]   there are all kinds of things happening now that 10 years, 100 years ago we would have
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.160]   thought were ridiculous and impossible.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.280]   So it's hard to know where this will or might stop.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.080]   But as you say, there are all kinds of things that just cannot be true of someone who transitions.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.320]   And I guess at the base level, the level of their chromosomes, you can't.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.680]   So I don't know if you ever will be able to change a person's chromosomes.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.800]   So what we're really doing is simply creating an illusion.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.280]   And it's one of the ways in which people in the transgender community talk.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.840]   Their goal is to, and the word they use is pass, that is pass off as the, to convincingly
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.760]   pass off as the other, which sadly reveals the fact that they know they're not actually
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760]   the other.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.560]   But it's a deception.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   It's an illusion.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.320]   They're trying to look on the outside in such a way that they can convince others that they
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   are what they seem.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.480]   And look, there are some convincing transitions in that way.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.360]   A tragic story I read of recently of a man who was married to a trans woman and didn't
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.840]   know until, well, they wanted, he wanted at least to conceive a child.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.560]   And when that wasn't happening, suggested, you know, sort of medical exploration at that
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   point.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.720]   And, well, the wife revealed that she was a trans woman, not an actual woman and that
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.320]   destroyed the marriage.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.040]   So he was obviously fooled for many years.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.560]   So it is remarkable what can seem to be done.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.320]   But, but as you say, there are all kinds of things that are not possible.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.880]   And even if they are made possible, it'll be highly questionable as to whether they're
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.920]   remotely responsible.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.960]   So look, I'm really speculating as I guess anyone would at this point.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   But I suppose this one, one of the other thing to add here is this where Germaine Greer got
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:23.880]   into trouble in the UK when she was challenged that a trans woman was not a real woman and
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.920]   got held down, of course, by the particular university where she was meant to be speaking.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   But she was right.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.800]   A trans woman hasn't gone through all the experiences of a natural woman and in one
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.960]   sense, therefore can't speak to those and can't really say I've had, you know, I guess
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.480]   a properly female experience of life.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   Wow.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.960]   A man wanting to pass as a woman, but getting offended at not being affirmed as an ontological
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   woman.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.280]   I mean, that seems like terribly unresolvable tension.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   That's right.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   Massive tension.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.920]   And it's running all through this.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.960]   Transgender ideology is full of conflicts and contradictions, as is, I suppose, as we
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.840]   just revealed, this massive tension between feminist ideology and transgender ideology.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:21.240]   One at the heart of some ways of feminism is the idea that only bodies are male or female.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.080]   There's no such thing as a male brain or a female brain.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.080]   And therefore, you know, it's part of the wish of women to be able to do anything a
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.920]   man can do in that sense.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.880]   Whereas in the transgender scene, you've got people saying, no, no, I have a male brain
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.880]   in a female body.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.640]   And well, is that really the case?
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.000]   So yeah, look, there are conflicts and contradictions and tensions and complexities running through
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   all of this.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.720]   And it fascinates me that the sort of there's a well, the whole LGBT IQ, a umbrella of of
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.640]   agendas is not as unified as you might think.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:07.680]   When you sort of put the microscope on them, you have all of these clashes and ideological
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.960]   tensions there.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.720]   The one the one thing I think is worth adding on top of all the things we've discussed is
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.520]   that for any and every human being, whatever our particular set of life struggles, and
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.480]   because we all have some particular set of life struggles, we've been made by Jesus Christ
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.760]   for Jesus Christ, and we'll only truly know ourselves and be ourselves in Christ.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.560]   And so finding our identity in him is really the only place for any of us to begin.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.360]   Now, this, of course, may be highlighted in a special way for those who are battling unwanted
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.980]   same sex attraction as it is for those battling unwanted gender dysphoria.
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.120]   But it's actually true of all of us.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.640]   Until we find our rest in Christ, we will be trying to invent ourselves in some way
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.800]   or another in a way that in the end, we'll learn the end in tears.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   Amen.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   That is true of all of us.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.920]   We are all in this boat needy of Christ.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.600]   None of us are freaks.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   All of us are broken sinners.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   Thank you, Rob.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.680]   And thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast this week with our special guest,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.520]   Rob Smith from Sydney, Australia.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.420]   As we have talked about, the transgender movement is something we need to know about and understand
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.160]   as Christians.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.540]   For more details about this podcast, to catch up on past episodes from the week, or to subscribe

[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.080]   Well Monday, Pastor John returns and we will discuss how over the years he handled little
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.720]   children in big church and what age children participate in our corporate gatherings on
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   Sunday.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.880]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.440]   Have a wonderful weekend and we'll see you on Monday.
