[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So what is the difference between a madman and a genius?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.820]   Success.
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.820]   - The following is a conversation with Javier Mele,
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.300]   the president of Argentina.
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.220]   He is a libertarian, a narco-capitalist, and economist,
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.720]   who campaigned with a chainsaw that symbolized his promise
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.280]   to slash the corrupt bureaucracy of the state.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.640]   He stepped into the presidency one year ago,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880]   with a country on the brink of hyperinflation,
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.880]   deep in debt, and suffering
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.920]   from mass unemployment and poverty.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.040]   He took this crisis head on,
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.460]   transforming one of Latin America's largest economies
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.680]   through pure free market principles.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.600]   In just a few months in office,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.840]   he already achieved Argentina's first fiscal surplus
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.760]   in 16 years, and not just avoided hyperinflation,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.480]   but brought inflation down to its lowest in three years.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.520]   We'll discuss all of this in detail,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.200]   both the successes and the challenges.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.920]   His depth of knowledge of economic principles,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.600]   metrics, and data was truly impressive,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.840]   and refreshing to hear from a world leader.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.880]   But even bigger than the economic transformation
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.040]   of Argentina, Javier represents the universal fight
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.660]   against government corruption and the fight for freedom,
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.640]   economic freedom, political freedom,
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.500]   and freedom of speech.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.280]   He has many critics, many of whom are part
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.680]   of the corrupt establishment he's seeking to dismantle.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.560]   But many are simply Argentinian citizens,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.080]   scared of the pain his radical policies may bring,
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.660]   at least in the short term.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.320]   But whether one disagrees with his methods or not,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.120]   no one can deny that his presidency marks
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.160]   one of the most ambitious attempts
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.960]   at economic transformation in modern history,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.880]   and that Javier Mele is truly a force of nature,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.840]   combining the rigor of an economist
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.240]   with the passion of a revolutionary
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.680]   in the fight for freedom of a nation he loves.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.200]   Argentina is one of my favorite countries,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.540]   so I sincerely hope he succeeds.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.300]   This interview was conducted
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.080]   with the president speaking Spanish and me speaking English
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.700]   with an interpreter simultaneously translating.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.160]   We make the episode available, overdubbed and subtitled
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.880]   in both English and Spanish,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.560]   thanks to our great friends at Eleven Labs.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.920]   If you're watching on YouTube,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.840]   you can switch between English and Spanish
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.660]   by clicking the gear icon, selecting audio track,
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.480]   and then choosing the language.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.000]   Same with the captions.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.200]   If you're watching on X,
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.520]   I'll post both Spanish and English versions separately.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.440]   If you're watching on Spotify or listening elsewhere,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.880]   I'll probably only post the English version.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.220]   This is a first time for me doing something like this
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.720]   in a foreign language.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.440]   It was challenging, but illuminating.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.880]   I hope to continue talking to many world leaders
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.880]   for two to three hours in this way,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.120]   including Vladimir Zelensky, Vladimir Putin,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.720]   Narendra Modi, and Xi Jinping.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.320]   I want to explore who they are, how they think,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.440]   and how they hope to help their country
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.840]   and humanity flourish.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.540]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.680]   in the description.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.240]   And now, dear friends, here's Javier Molay.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.820]   When did you first understand the value of freedom,
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.220]   especially economic freedom?
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.940]   - Well, actually, I came to understand the ideas of freedom.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.240]   As an economic growth specialist
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.020]   back in the years of 2013 to 2014,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.020]   I could see that per capita GDP statistics
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.180]   over the last 2,000 years of the Christian era
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.740]   essentially looked like a hockey stick,
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.300]   indicating that per capita GDP remained almost constant
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.260]   until around 1800, after which it accelerated sharply.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.220]   In the same context of that phenomenal increase
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.060]   in productivity and per capita GDP,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.940]   the population had multiplied sevenfold
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.100]   over the preceding 200 years.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.900]   So basically, in economics,
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.960]   that means you get increasing returns,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.460]   and the presence of increasing returns
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.460]   implies the existence of monopolies, concentrated structures,
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.900]   and according to traditional neoclassical economic theory,
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.500]   the presence of monopolies and concentrated structures
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.780]   is not a good thing.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.500]   But at the same time,
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.540]   one could see that living standards
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.860]   had increased tremendously,
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.380]   and that middle-income people ended up living far better
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.980]   than emperors did in the Roman era,
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.900]   and the population had gone from having 95% of people
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.420]   in extreme poverty to less than 10%.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.860]   And in that context, the question was
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.380]   how it could be that something
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.500]   that had lifted so many people out of poverty,
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.900]   that had improved human conditions so much,
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.580]   could be something bad for economic theory,
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.740]   meaning something was not right.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.060]   So in that context,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.060]   I remember that one of the people who worked on my team
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.940]   suggested I read an article by Murray Newton Rothbard
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.860]   called "Monopoly and Competition."
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.540]   I remember reading it like it was today.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.140]   And after reading it carefully, I said,
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.620]   "Everything I've taught about market structure
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.180]   "in the last 20 years in courses on microeconomics is wrong."
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.980]   This caused a very strong internal commotion in me,
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.820]   so I called this person who used to work with me,
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.700]   and they recommended a place
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.540]   to buy Austrian School of Economics books,
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.380]   and I remember I bought at least 20 or 30 books,
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.660]   which I went to pick up one Saturday afternoon.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.180]   And when I visited the bookstore,
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.740]   I was fascinated by all the stuff they had there.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.380]   So I went back the next day,
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.780]   and I started calculating how much money
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.260]   I needed to pay for my dog's food.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.660]   That's my four-legged child,
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.060]   and how much I needed to spend on the taxi fare and food.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.380]   And then with what I have left,
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.780]   I spent all of it on more books.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.140]   And then I started to read very intensively.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.740]   And I remember, for example,
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.740]   the experience of reading "Human Action" by Mises,
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.780]   and this was a book that I didn't know about.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.340]   And I remember that on the following weekend,
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.140]   I started to read this book right from the first page,
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.460]   and I didn't stop until I finished it,
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.380]   and that was a true revolution in my head.
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.820]   And having the chance to read Austrian authors
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.820]   like Rothbard, Mises, Hayek, Hoppe,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.220]   and Jesus Huerta de Soto,
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.460]   or others like Juan Ramon Rallo,
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.540]   Philippe Bagus, and Walter Bloch, for example,
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.900]   that was very inspirational.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.460]   And at one point, I got the opportunity to read
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.460]   related to the works of Alberto Venegas Linchijo,
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.220]   and I also had the pleasure and honor to meet him.
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.580]   And today, we are actually friends.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.500]   So that paved the way for me
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.940]   to approach the ideas of freedom.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.660]   And another book that was a very significant influence
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.500]   and impact on me was "The Principles of Political Economics"
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.340]   by Menger.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.140]   It was truly eye-opening.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.460]   Or let's say, for reading Ogen von Böhm-Bawerk,
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.180]   these were things that really,
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.180]   that really challenged all of my former thinking.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.460]   I had a vague idea and poor about the Austrian school.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.500]   The only thing I had read about the Austrian school
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.180]   until then had been "Money and Time,"
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.660]   a very good book by Garrison.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.340]   But now that I understand a little bit more
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.900]   about Austrian economics,
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.500]   I know that it was rather poor.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.420]   This doesn't mean that the book isn't good,
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.260]   but there were a whole lot of things to read
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.780]   that ended up being truly fascinating.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.060]   - So from that, what is now today,
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.420]   and maybe you can talk about the evolution,
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.180]   is your philosophy, economics philosophy.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.380]   You've described yourself as an anarcho-capitalist,
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.500]   market anarchist, libertarian.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.060]   That's the ideal.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.340]   And then maybe in practice and reality,
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.900]   you've said that you're more of a minarchist.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.260]   So lay it all out.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.500]   What's your economics philosophy today?
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.300]   - Strictly speaking, I am an anarcho-capitalist.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.660]   I despise the state government.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.420]   I despise violence.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.420]   Let us suppose we take the definition of liberalism.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.020]   I usually use the definition of liberalism
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.700]   given by Alberto Venegas Lynch,
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.700]   which is very much in line with the definition of John Locke,
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.020]   which essentially matches the definition
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.780]   by Alberto Venegas Lynch, Jr.,
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.740]   who said that liberalism is the unrestricted respect
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.860]   for the life project of others
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.100]   based on the principle of non-aggression
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.300]   and in defense of the right to life, liberty, and property.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.620]   So I frame all of the discussions within those terms.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.540]   And the fact is that when you get to that notion,
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.580]   I would dare say
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.780]   that you become an anarcho-capitalist de facto.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.860]   And what that describes, it is an idea
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.780]   which represents my ideal world.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.980]   I mean, that is the ideal world.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.660]   Now, real life poses a whole lot of restraints,
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.860]   and some of those you can lift,
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.220]   and those restrictions and others you can't.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.660]   So in real life, I am a minarchist.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.860]   I advocate for minimizing state size.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.340]   I try to remove as many regulations as possible.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.260]   In fact, that is what I used to say during my campaign,
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.380]   and let's say that is what I'm now carrying out.
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.460]   We have just carried out the largest structural reform
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.060]   in Argentine history.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.540]   It is a structural reform
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.700]   that is eight times larger than Menem's,
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.700]   which had been the largest structural reform in history.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.340]   And we did that with 15% of the representatives
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.700]   and 10% of the senators.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.740]   Furthermore, we have a deregulation ministry
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.420]   where basically every day
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.860]   we eliminate between one and five regulations.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.780]   On the other hand,
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.100]   we have 3,200 additional structural reforms pending
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.820]   to the point that the day we finish all these reforms,
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.780]   we will be the freest country on the planet
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.540]   with the consequences they have in terms of well-being.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.740]   Think about this.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.860]   When Ireland started market reforms just over 40 years ago,
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.420]   it was the poorest country in Europe.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.300]   Today, its GDP per capita is 50% higher
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.780]   than that of the United States.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.780]   So this, I have a current situation
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.020]   and what I am constantly looking for,
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.300]   whether from my academic works
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.980]   and my outreach notes and books,
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.660]   is the world we have today.
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.100]   That every day we are closer,
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.940]   that every day we gain more freedom
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.380]   because there are some very interesting things here.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.620]   First, I would like to quote Milton Friedman.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.100]   There is a moment when they do an interview
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.780]   with Milton Friedman and they ask him about liberals
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.140]   and then he says that there are three types of liberals.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.100]   There are the classical liberals where, for example,
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.660]   Adam Smith or Milton Friedman himself could fit.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.820]   Some say that Hayek could fit into that category.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.980]   For me, Hayek is a minarchist.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.740]   Then you have the minarchists
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.460]   where you could clearly find in that place,
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:48.460]   Mises, Hayek, one could find in philosophical terms,
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.020]   Nozick and basically Ayn Rand.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.820]   And at one point, Milton Friedman, based on his own son,
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.860]   he says, "But if you look closely,
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.820]   "there are some who are anarchists."
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.260]   Let's say, probably from my point of view,
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.260]   the person who has been the greatest inspiration
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.260]   in my life is essentially Murray Newton Rothbard.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.300]   So therefore, there are two dimensions.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.740]   One is where I want to go and the topic is where I stand.
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.500]   So the most important thing is to try each day
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.900]   to advance further toward that ideal of anarcho-capitalism.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.900]   In that sense, sometimes we face strong
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.740]   and harsh criticism regarding that ideal vision.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.300]   I think that's the Nirvana fallacy.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.260]   If you compare yourself against paradise,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.060]   everything is horrible and miserable,
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.660]   but you don't live in paradise, you live on earth.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.700]   Basically, what you need to understand
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.340]   is something called the state conditions.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.820]   Let's suppose that you don't like rectangular tables,
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.420]   you prefer circular tables.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:12.420]   Now, the reality is I have only a few hours
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.900]   until I go and catch my flight and the table is rectangular.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.060]   You like a circular table, a round one, but there isn't one.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.860]   What you have is a rectangular table.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.540]   So either we do the interview here or we just can't do it.
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.740]   So what do you do?
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.140]   You adapt to the current conditions.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.140]   This is what there is.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.820]   Now, so then you have some restrictions that you can change
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.740]   and others that you cannot.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.420]   The idea is to modify all the ones
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.140]   that can be changed in the short term
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.140]   and start working on those that can be modified
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.420]   in the medium or long term.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.260]   For example, if you really like round tables,
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.980]   perhaps the next interview we may do at a round table,
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.700]   we're going to try and solve it.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.060]   But today it's something that we couldn't possibly solve.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.140]   So that's basically the idea, right?
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.420]   Let's say it's about understanding
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.980]   that some restrictions you can change,
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.820]   others you can,
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.420]   and there are institutional restrictions too.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.340]   There are many anarcho-capitalists
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.940]   who are dedicated to criticizing,
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.700]   and incredibly they do so
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.100]   with more violence towards liberals,
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.540]   and many of them actually criticize me,
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.180]   which truly make no sense
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:40.220]   because it is precisely the Nirvana fallacy.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.580]   But the reality is that,
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.940]   look, in Argentina, for example,
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.220]   the most popular sport is soccer.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.500]   When you go to watch an Argentina match, it is beautiful.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.780]   The stands are full
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.140]   and they're all painted with sky blue and white colors.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.700]   There is a lot of joy,
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.100]   people sing songs that are very fun,
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.740]   that are very distinctive,
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.860]   it's very much part of Argentine folklore, so to speak.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:19.860]   But you see, that beautiful show is external.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.340]   That is to say, it does not determine the outcome.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.300]   You place the ball in the middle of the field
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.940]   and no matter how much people shout,
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.540]   the ball doesn't move.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.820]   The one who moves the ball and scores the goals is messy.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.660]   So, what do I mean?
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.860]   If you don't get involved and don't get into it,
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.780]   no, you don't do anything.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.580]   So, I mean, what do I know
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.060]   is that there are many liberals, libertarians,
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.740]   and anarcho-capitalists who are really useless
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.500]   because all they do is criticize,
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.940]   let's say, those of us who want to lead the world
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.220]   toward the ideas of freedom,
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.100]   and what they don't realize is that power is a zero-sum game.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.700]   And if we don't have it, then the left will have it.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.980]   Therefore, if you level your harshest criticism
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.220]   at those in your own ranks,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.220]   you end up being subservient to socialism, probably.
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.660]   And also, for instance,
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:23.660]   you have cases of strong hypocrisy, let's say.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.540]   I have seen cases of agorists.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.180]   I mean, it's the anarcho-capitalists
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.660]   who criticize Rothbard
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:36.100]   because he said that you have to get into politics,
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.540]   otherwise the socialists will advance.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.260]   And it's interesting because some of them,
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.420]   I have seen them criticizing, proposing agorism.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.300]   And I remember one of them, one day,
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.180]   the police showed up,
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.220]   and honestly, he was peeing himself.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.700]   So, I mean, it's very easy to criticize, propose, and suggest,
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.860]   but if he was truly such an agonist,
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.020]   he should have been willing to endure going to jail.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.900]   However, when it was time to face
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.940]   the consequences of the idea he was promoting,
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.540]   he froze, wet his pants,
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.660]   and ended up, let's say, accepting all the restrictions
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.660]   because clearly it was better to be out of jail than in jail.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.340]   But in doing so, he sold out his ideas.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.940]   So, it seems to me that no,
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:38.100]   not taking into account the restrictions of the situation
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.220]   only serves to be functional to socialism
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.900]   because all it does is strike against one's own.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.860]   - So, you became president 11 months ago.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.300]   Can you, again, describe some of the actions you took?
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.060]   For example, you cut half the number
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.540]   of government ministries, layoffs, removed price controls.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.980]   It'll be interesting to lay out the first steps.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.300]   And what's next?
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.300]   - If you allow me, I will first give you a description
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.700]   of the situation we received.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.500]   And based on that, I will tell you each of the things we did
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:19.700]   when we first took office.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.180]   Basically, what we found was that in the first week
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.180]   of December, inflation was rising at a rate of 1% per day,
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:34.260]   which means 3,700% annually.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.060]   In the first half of December,
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.220]   it had accelerated to 7,500% annually.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.980]   When you look at wholesale inflation in December
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.980]   of last year, it was 54%, which if annualized,
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.500]   would equate to an inflation rate of 17,000% per year.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:01.700]   And in addition, Argentina, for the previous 10 years,
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.180]   had not been growing, with a drop in GDP per capita
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.620]   of approximately 15%.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.620]   And the reality was that nearly 50% were living in poverty.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:20.620]   Now, later, I will get deeper into that discussion.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.220]   And the reality is that we had a fiscal deficit,
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.900]   which amounted to 15% of GDP.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.740]   Five points were in the Treasury,
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.380]   10 points were in the Central Bank,
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.740]   which was endogenous monetary issuance.
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.980]   And the reality is that we also had interest-bearing
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.020]   liabilities at the Central Bank equivalent
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.900]   to four monetary bases, maturing in one day,
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.780]   meaning we could have quintupled
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.420]   the amount of money in one day.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.300]   We had peso-denominated maturities
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.100]   amounting to the equivalent of $90 billion.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.060]   The Central Bank had negative net currency
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.260]   foreign reserves, minus $12 billion.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.180]   We had commercial debts in the Central Bank
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.460]   equivalent to $50 billion.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.900]   There were company dividends held back
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.660]   amounting to $10 billion.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:24.700]   Therefore, if we had instantly opened up,
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.300]   you see, I say we are liberal libertarians,
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.260]   we are not liberal fools.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.780]   That's what some anarchist liberals suggested,
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.380]   meaning that we basically open everything on the first day.
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.060]   So in that context, of course,
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.380]   if we had done that,
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.700]   we would have encountered hyperinflation.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.300]   Therefore, that would have led to the number
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.500]   of poor people being around 95%.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.340]   And probably, and by December,
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.500]   the Peronist Party would have organized
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.140]   supermarkets lootings and would have done
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.220]   all sorts of things and would have probably been ousted.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.420]   And by the first part of the year,
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.860]   the Peronists would have gone back to office.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:18.140]   So to us, it was crucial to end fiscal deficit.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.660]   One of the things we promised during the campaign
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.900]   had been to reduce the number of ministries.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.900]   And indeed, we reduced to less than half
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.620]   the number of ministries because we went
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.620]   to nine ministries, today we have eight.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.700]   We have also laid off a large number of civil employees.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.820]   Today, I can say that we have already
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.020]   dismissed about 50,000 of them.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.180]   And we practically don't renew any contracts
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.180]   unless the positions are absolutely necessary.
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.460]   At the same time, we have stopped public works
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.300]   and we have eliminated discretionary transfers
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.740]   to the provinces.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.620]   We have also diluted public sector wages.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.940]   Also, we have eliminated economic subsidies
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.860]   by restoring utility rates to the right levels.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:22.060]   And well, and in that, let's say in this context,
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.820]   we achieved fiscal deficit as far
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.460]   as the treasury is concerned.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.820]   This is very important because in the last 123 years,
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.020]   Argentina had a deficit for 113 of them.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.540]   And in the 10 years, it did not have a deficit
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.580]   because it was not paying the debt.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.540]   So that was absolutely false.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.780]   And they told us it would be impossible to do that.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.540]   We had planned to do so within a year.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.940]   And they said it wasn't possible to adjust
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.860]   by more than one percentage point.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:00.940]   And we achieved fiscal balance in the month of January,
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.020]   that is the first month of administration.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.740]   At the same time, we also cut social plans
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.100]   linked to intermediation.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.660]   This is very important because we knew
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.060]   we were going to make a very tough adjustment.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.860]   And we knew that this was going to have
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.660]   a cot in social terms.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.780]   And we knew that we had to offer support
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.580]   during the first month.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.820]   I mean, the first quarter and second quarter in office,
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.660]   one of the things we did was to eliminate
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.860]   what are known as poverty managers,
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.020]   that is intermediaries.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.260]   Basically, people have a guard
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.380]   through which they receive assistance,
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.020]   but it happens that they had to provide a counter service.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.060]   And that counter service was verified
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.260]   by a group called the Picateros.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.580]   So in that context, when they were going to sign,
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.580]   the counter service took away half of the money.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:06.100]   So by removing that payoff, they stopped extorting them,
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.060]   stopped stealing their money,
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.860]   and with the same amount of money,
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.380]   they received double the resources.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.540]   And of course, we also provided an additional boost.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.700]   So let's say that this is related
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.180]   to the five adjustment points in the treasury.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.940]   Now what happens?
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.260]   As we began to achieve fiscal balance
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.340]   and no longer needed to issue money to finance ourselves,
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.580]   and as we also met interest payments
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.420]   and some capital repayments,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.700]   one of the things that happened
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.020]   is that the debt market began to be recreated.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.260]   So we were able to take debt out of the central bank
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.180]   and transfer it to the treasury
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.380]   where it should have always been.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.980]   And that meant an adjustment
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.140]   of approximately 10% of GDP.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.420]   Everyone said this would be impossible
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.900]   and couldn't be fixed.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.340]   Essentially, what we did was implement a fiscal adjustment
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.620]   at the central bank amounting to 10% of GDP.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.580]   So if you ask me,
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.820]   it's clear that we have not only made
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.940]   the biggest fiscal adjustment in the history of humanity,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.660]   because we made a fiscal adjustment
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.100]   of 15 points of the GDP,
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.620]   but also most of that went back to the people
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.660]   as less seniorage, as a lower inflation rate.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.980]   It's true that we temporarily raised the country tax,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.180]   but we lowered it in September.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.020]   And now in December, we're going to eliminate it.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.060]   Today, for example, we also announced that in December
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.420]   we are eliminating import taxes.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.940]   In fact, in that regard,
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.900]   what you have is that we return
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.260]   to the people 13.5 points of GDP
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.140]   because the real tax burden is the size of the state.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:59.140]   So while back in December we were discussing hyperinflation,
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.500]   today we are discussing 30-year loans.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.540]   In other words, all those resources
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.860]   that the national government used to take
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.300]   are now back in the private sector.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.660]   And that's what has allowed it to be very dynamic.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.300]   And this has two very strong impacts.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.540]   The first one is that if you look at wholesale inflation,
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.900]   it went down from 54% to 2%.
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.900]   So it went down by 27 times.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.380]   It was divided into 27.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.700]   So we had inflation at a rate of 17,000% annually,
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.020]   and it's now close to about 28% a year.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.500]   But it's not only that.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.020]   You could consider consumer inflation,
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.660]   the latest consumer inflation rate was 2.7%.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.540]   Now it happens that we essentially,
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.580]   due to a matter that is related
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.500]   to the central bank's balance sheets,
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.380]   and also due to the debt stocks,
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.980]   we still have controls in place
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.180]   and we are eliminating restrictions day by day.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.300]   Now, the interesting thing is that
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.500]   we have a 2% monthly devaluation standard,
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.580]   and there's international inflation, of course,
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.020]   which means that you then have to subtract
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.860]   two and a half points from the inflation
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.420]   observed by the consumer.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.540]   This indicates that inflation in Argentina,
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.540]   the true inflation, not the induced one,
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.540]   but the actual monetary inflation, is 0.2% per month.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.900]   At 0.2% per month, this equates to 2.4% annually.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.020]   What I'm saying is the original discussion
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.580]   was about whether inflation could reach 17,000%.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.980]   Now, we are bringing inflation down
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:50.980]   to levels of 2.5% annually, and that is amazing.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.820]   And we achieve this by considering a number of factors.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.500]   The first one is that we did not experience
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   a previous hyperinflation,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.540]   which would have simplified the process
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.620]   of implementing a stabilization program.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.180]   Typically, when hyperinflation occurs,
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.500]   monetary assets are diluted,
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.780]   leading to a natural restoration of demand.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.300]   And besides, we did not resort to any expropriation.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.820]   For example, before the Convertibility Plan,
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.380]   which was the most successful program
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.700]   in Argentina's history,
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.980]   Argentina experienced two instances of hyperinflation.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.540]   During Alfonsín's administration,
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.420]   inflation reached 5,000%,
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.300]   and under Menem, it was 1,200%.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.660]   Additionally, there was the Bonex Plan,
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.220]   under which debt was exchanged on a compulsory basis.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.180]   In other words, what we did instead
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.780]   was clean up the central bank balance sheet.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:50.980]   So with that, we cleaned up the central bank's balance sheet,
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:56.260]   we cleared a loss of $45 billion, all voluntarily.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.940]   And the most amazing thing
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.780]   is that we did it in just six months.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.140]   And at the same time, we have not controlled prices,
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.780]   nor have we fixed the exchange rate.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.660]   And this is very important.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.580]   All previous stabilization programs,
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.300]   in an effort to show quick results, used to do this.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.940]   What they would do is, before announcing the plan,
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.540]   they would adjust the rates,
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.300]   and once the rates were adjusted,
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.780]   they would launch the plan.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.100]   But in our case, we couldn't afford that luxury,
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.260]   so we had to implement it on the go.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:35.900]   And also, over the past few months, that is to say,
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.580]   companies brought in rates that covered only about 10%.
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.700]   Whereas today, they cover 80%, so you get the picture.
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.420]   Just imagine the adjustment we are making.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.420]   And in that sense,
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.620]   it is also incredible what we have achieved,
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.100]   because if we were to work with the inflation
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.180]   we have in our country today,
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.980]   considering the exchange rate situation,
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.300]   the figures are even better than during
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.620]   the Convertibility Program,
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.900]   which was the most successful economic program
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.780]   in Argentina's history.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.060]   And in fact, there is an article called Passing the Buck,
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:17.220]   which is by Gerardo de la Paulera Bozzoli and Irigoyen,
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.300]   that demonstrates that Menem's first government
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   was the best government in history.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.100]   And basically, it argues two things.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.980]   In the success of the stabilization
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.060]   of the Convertibility Program.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.700]   So if you take a closer look,
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.860]   when you examine it carefully,
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.380]   when you account for all these factors,
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.140]   our disinflation process is actually much more genuine.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.900]   And not only that, it's also much deeper.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.540]   We restored freedoms to Argentinians
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.260]   while simultaneously implementing a structural reform
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.340]   eight times larger.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.020]   And we accomplished this with only,
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:01.180]   with 15% of the representatives, 10% of the senators,
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.100]   and within the first six months of government.
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.100]   In other words, our deregulation agenda continues daily,
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:12.900]   and we still have 3,200 structural reforms pending.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.140]   This will ultimately make Argentina
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.900]   the freest country in the world.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.740]   Moreover, to have a sense of magnitude,
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.740]   the reforms that we already have made
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.420]   with the Executive Order 7023,
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.540]   and with the Basis Law,
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:30.420]   we have actually jumped 90 places
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.500]   in terms of economic freedom.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.540]   What this means is that today,
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.060]   Argentina has institutions similar to those of Germany,
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.580]   France, Italy, and we obviously want this to continue.
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.780]   And let's say, we are going to surpass, no doubt,
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.300]   the levels of economic freedom
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.540]   that Ireland reached in its best moment.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.820]   And not only that, we're going to exceed
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.300]   the levels of economic freedom of Australia,
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.140]   New Zealand, and Switzerland.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.580]   We are undoubtedly going to be
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.580]   the freest country in the world.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:04.580]   And this means that thanks to what we've done today,
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.500]   we are on a path that allows us
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:12.180]   to multiply our per capita GDP by 2.5 times
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.460]   when you apply the relevant correction.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.260]   And this, of course, is something very interesting
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.180]   because it implies a huge increase in well-being.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.620]   And furthermore, today, the Argentinian economy
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.900]   is already strongly and amazingly recovering.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.740]   And we can say, analysts' hypotheses were suggesting
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.700]   that next year, we would be growing between 5 and 6%.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.580]   Today, JP Morgan has now corrected,
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.220]   or let's say, revised the projections upwards.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.140]   And besides, when we normalized the price situation,
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.660]   the true poverty rate came up and it was 57% in January.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.980]   Today, it is at 46%,
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.780]   meaning we lowered poverty by 11 percentage points.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.900]   Let's say, I mean, it seems truly like a miracle.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.300]   And not only that, but actually,
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.980]   not a single job was lost in the process.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.020]   When it comes to all of this inflation reduction process,
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.580]   people said that our economy
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.460]   and economic activity would collapse.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:17.100]   And actually, when you look at the de-seasonalized data,
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.820]   you see that in August, there was a recovery
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.340]   that took us back to December levels, to December levels.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.740]   That means that in the year
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.260]   we made the largest fiscal adjustment
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.140]   in the history of humanity,
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.580]   we will end up with less inflation, fewer poor people,
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.100]   better real wages, and additionally,
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.820]   a GDP higher than what we started with.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.540]   And if you look at it in dollars,
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.220]   I can assure you that the numbers are phenomenal,
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.980]   because basically, today,
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.060]   the dollar is below the levels we had when we took office.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.500]   So the reality is that in all of this,
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.100]   when you take my popularity levels
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.620]   and the government's acceptance levels,
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.860]   today, they are above the moment we assumed office,
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.660]   if you know that the moment of maximum popularity
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.780]   is when you take office.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.900]   Therefore, this means that far from
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.980]   resting on our laurels with this,
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.820]   we're going for more reforms,
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.500]   we're going to deepen the reforms,
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.540]   and I tell you, we won't stop until Argentina
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.180]   is the freest country in the world.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:30.020]   Furthermore, a recent work by an Argentinian economist
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.900]   named Juan Pablo Nicolini
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.380]   was presented at the Central Bank's monetary meetings,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.340]   and he works at the Federal Reserve.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.940]   And it's interesting because he shows that
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.340]   only on the basis of what we have done in fiscal matters,
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.380]   it ensures that in the span of 10 years,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.500]   we can double the GDP per capita,
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   meaning that Argentina could grow at rates of 7% annually,
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.700]   which is very much, very much,
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.340]   and that has strong consequences
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.260]   in terms of improving quality of life,
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.420]   reducing poverty, reducing indigence.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.140]   Therefore, if during the worst moment
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.740]   our image didn't suffer and we stayed strong in our ideas,
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.620]   now that everything is working much better,
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.340]   why should we change?
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.500]   On the contrary, we are ready to redouble the bet,
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.420]   to redouble our efforts
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.620]   because we've done things that no one else has done.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.340]   I will give you an example.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.820]   There's something that seems trivial,
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.700]   but there's what's called the single-paper ballot.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.820]   Argentina used to vote with huge ballots,
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.020]   which were very, above all, very costly,
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.340]   and that reform, it never,
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.580]   let's say it wasn't done
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.500]   because it always harmed the ruling party.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.220]   So everyone talked about going to the single-paper ballot,
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.180]   but no one did it when they were in power.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.580]   They didn't want to implement it
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.580]   because they preferred to commit fraud
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.420]   or use some kind of trickery
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.900]   to avoid applying that rule
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.380]   that makes the election more competitive.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.660]   Well, what's interesting, we sent that law
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.740]   and it was approved.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.260]   What's more, now we are finishing
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.980]   with the open, simultaneous, and mandatory primaries
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.580]   because it was a mechanism
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.700]   by which politics was also stealing.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.540]   We are eliminating the financing of political parties.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.180]   If you look, we have reduced the fiscal pressure
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:39.220]   by 15 points to the Argentineans.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.220]   We are restoring freedoms
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.220]   with a deep set of structural and regulatory reforms.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.660]   That is, I think that
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.500]   any sensible liberal
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.060]   could perceive we are already delivering
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.700]   a wonderful government.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.060]   In fact, it's the best government
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.700]   in the history of Argentina.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.420]   If the best had been that of Menem,
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.420]   we've already outpaced him.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.580]   - Maybe you can explain to me
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:11.020]   the metrics of poverty and unemployment.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.060]   As you said, unemployment went down,
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.900]   real unemployment went down,
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.220]   real poverty went down.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.820]   But even that aside,
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.900]   what have been the most painful impacts
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.220]   of these radical reforms?
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.380]   And how many of them are required in the short term
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.780]   to have a big positive impact in the long term?
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.860]   - Let's take it step by step, all right?
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.700]   That is,
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:39.100]   we, in fact, we started to do things right,
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.500]   therefore we did not create poverty.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.300]   The poverty was an inherited poverty.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:48.700]   The point is that what we did was to reveal it.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.220]   I'll try to explain it with an example
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.700]   that I think clarifies what's happening in Argentina.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.620]   Argentina was an economy that had
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.700]   a total price controls.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.100]   It had a fiscal deficit,
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.780]   which was financed through money printing,
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.180]   just for you, to give you an idea.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.060]   In the last year,
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.340]   Argentina financed 13 points
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.140]   of the gross domestic product with money printing.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.060]   In other words, a real disaster.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:26.420]   So, that situation provoked this artificially demand
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.740]   and puts pressure on prices.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.820]   The issue is that price controls are applied
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.900]   additionally over the prices
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.820]   that they enter the price index,
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.060]   with which inflation was,
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.740]   I'm not saying they were lying about it,
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.580]   it was distorted.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.020]   And since Argentina measures poverty
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.620]   and indigence by income line,
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.500]   then what happens?
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.500]   That distorted the true levels of poverty, of course,
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.140]   but that's not the only effect.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.060]   I mean, let's say the real poverty levels were higher,
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.220]   quite a bit higher than those shown
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.660]   by the previous government,
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.660]   which showed them at 41%
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.460]   and also did so on a six monthly basis.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.780]   So, if you, let's say, have a growing trend,
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.740]   they are actually leaving you a bomb
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.380]   and you don't see it.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.820]   Because let's say, basically,
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:23.820]   the indicator was measured with a delayed form.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.020]   But not only that, imagine that you are also given,
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:32.900]   you are in the middle of an island alone
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.900]   and they give you $1 million.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.180]   What can you do with that?
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:42.140]   You cannot do anything because you cannot buy anything.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.660]   It's the same as if someone tells you
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.140]   that the price of glasses is $10,
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:53.060]   but when you want to buy it, it's not available.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.460]   Actually, there's a joke told by an Argentinian professor
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.540]   named Juan Carlos De Pablo,
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.540]   who says that a man goes to a bazaar and asks for a vase.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.940]   Then he says to him, "Well, I want that vase.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.780]   "How much would you charge me?"
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.700]   Then he says, "$5,000."
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.900]   "Oh, okay, $5,000, but why $5,000
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.580]   "if across the street it's $1,000?"
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.500]   He says, "Well, go buy it across the street for $1,000."
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.140]   "Ah, there's none for $1,000."
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.620]   "Well, then here when there's more,
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.500]   "it'll also cost $1,000."
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.140]   In other words, prices at which they are available.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.820]   So what happens?
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.540]   When you are faced with that situation,
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.140]   the supermarket shelves were empty.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.060]   So what was the point of having a price
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.900]   at which you couldn't buy anything?
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.980]   You left those prices, the shelves were empty,
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.660]   so the statistics showed that you were much better.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.100]   But the reality is you couldn't buy anything.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.580]   You couldn't make it happen.
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:52.020]   So if you left the situation as it was,
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.220]   people were going to starve
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.260]   because they couldn't buy anything.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.900]   Yes, they had a certain amount of money
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.180]   that could supposedly buy certain goods,
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.100]   but those goods were not available.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.780]   What is the only thing you can do to save people?
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.100]   Make the prices transparent and allow products to reappear.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.980]   Well, when you make the prices transparent,
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.420]   you also make transparent the cost of the basic food basket
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.220]   and the total basic basket,
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.340]   meaning the poverty line, sorry,
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.300]   the indigence line and the poverty line respectively.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.340]   And when you do that,
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.940]   clearly you will see a jump in poverty.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.500]   That brought poverty up to 57%.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.340]   Now, Argentina found its activity floor
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.420]   in the month of April.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.380]   From that moment,
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.540]   Argentina began to invent a cyclical recovery,
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.780]   real wages have been growing every month above inflation.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.220]   Therefore, nominal wages are beating inflation.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.180]   In fact, we are already at levels
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.740]   similar to those we had in November.
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.020]   The same goes for pensions.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:57.540]   Moreover, also let's say there is a rebound in activity
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.340]   due to the recovery of the stock cycle.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.260]   Therefore, this is also contributing
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.100]   to more and better paid jobs.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.420]   In fact, this is so strong and evident
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:10.460]   that the wages growing the most are in the informal sector.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.300]   This means that poverty and extreme poverty
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.220]   are decreasing much faster than we imagined.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.220]   But not only that, by eliminating inflation,
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.700]   you remove the inflationary tax,
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.980]   but the real burden is the fiscal deficit,
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:27.060]   which was 15 points of the GDP.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.540]   Okay, we temporarily raised the country tax,
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.700]   now we lower it, but we return that to the Argentinians.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.340]   We gave back 15 points of the GDP.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:41.100]   Not only that, but also when you eliminate inflation,
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.060]   you remove the distortion of relative prices.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.300]   Therefore, the allocation of resources is much better.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.100]   Not only that, but also with the strong
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.620]   fiscal adjustment we made,
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.420]   we have reduced the country risk
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.300]   from 3,000 basis points to 770.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.300]   Today, Fitch raised Argentina's rating to triple C.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.220]   So, what do I mean?
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.780]   That translates into a lower country risk
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.220]   and interest rates,
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.660]   and that generates an increase in investment,
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.460]   also generates an increase in consumption.
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.060]   In other words, the Argentinian economy
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.340]   is currently in an absolutely flourishing moment.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.380]   And how is that sustained in the long term?
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.020]   With structural reforms,
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.100]   which we implement daily deregulating the economy
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.380]   and introducing new laws that free Argentinians
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.980]   from the many oppressive measures
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.060]   that have burdened it over the past 100 years.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.300]   - You've spoken about the caste,
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.540]   the corrupt political establishment.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.060]   So, there's a lot of powerful people
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.700]   and groups that are against your ideas.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.500]   What does it take to fight
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.340]   when so much power is against you?
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.540]   - Look, we have fought against corruption
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.820]   like never before in Argentina.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.580]   In fact, when we took office, for example,
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.420]   there were about 900 roadblocks per year.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.500]   That is people who made a habit of blocking the streets.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.620]   They prevented free movement.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.500]   And besides, they were given social plans
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.660]   and they were given a lot of money.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.580]   If you remember, when I started by explaining the cuts,
[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.060]   one of the things I said was
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.900]   that we removed the middlemen of poverty.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.420]   In other words, the managers of poverty,
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.740]   those who live by stealing from the poor.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.460]   Well, that is a huge source of corruption.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.100]   In fact, when we did that,
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.340]   two days later,
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.580]   one of the most renowned and influential piqueteros
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.900]   called for a demonstration.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:51.260]   He claimed that 50,000 people would attend
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:55.180]   because he was actually expecting 100,000.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.620]   So he wanted to showcase it as a success.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.700]   And so then, let's say with the decision
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.620]   made in Human Capital to cut their funding,
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.900]   the anti-blockade protocol was also enacted
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.700]   where those who block the streets
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.820]   wouldn't receive welfare benefits
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.700]   and those who broke the law would go to jail.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.580]   All of that.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.940]   And also, we were informing this
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.420]   through transportation channels.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.540]   Well, in that march,
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:30.460]   they expected to have 100,000 people there.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.620]   And actually, it turned out to be 3,000 people.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.380]   And from that point on,
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.540]   they didn't block the streets anymore.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.300]   We also evidently put an end to that corruption.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.620]   One of the things that also generated a lot of corruption
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.300]   was public works.
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:52.180]   Another thing that led to significant acts of corruption
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.980]   were the discretionary transfers to provinces.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.420]   In general, these transfers were made to the provinces
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.620]   with accounting as obscure as possible.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:05.860]   So the national government,
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.060]   in collusion with the governors, let's say,
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.900]   the money ended up being used for other things.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.700]   Not only that with which we have already done many things.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.500]   Furthermore, the Ministry of Human Capital
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.620]   is always filing complaints in court,
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.580]   not in the media, in court.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:30.500]   Acts of corruption like never before in Argentine history.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.980]   Not only that, but also in terms of condemning corruption.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.180]   That is, we have done, for example,
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.340]   two days ago, it was condemned.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.940]   Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.220]   got a sentence for corruption.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.540]   I mean, due to corruption.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:49.540]   And the next day, that is yesterday,
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.620]   we took away their privileged pensions.
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.860]   At the same time, we are, for example,
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.780]   we have discovered that Kirchnerism used
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.340]   disability pensions for acts of corruption.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.980]   For example, there is a city
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.980]   that has more disability pensions than people.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.500]   In other words, to give you an idea
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.340]   of the things being done in Argentina.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.740]   And also in Argentina,
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:16.500]   we have restored freedom to the judiciary.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.340]   We do not pressure the judiciary.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.780]   And this is so true that during my government,
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:25.340]   not only was Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner convicted,
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.580]   but also the two terrorist attacks
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.820]   carried out by Iran were condemned.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:34.540]   So, if there is a government
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.380]   that is truly fighting against corruption, it is us.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.260]   Not only that, but also with each deregulation,
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.380]   it is a privilege that we take away
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.580]   either from a politician, a preliminary company,
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.660]   or a power group.
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:54.460]   That is also very powerful.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.220]   No one in Argentina has ever fought
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.500]   against corruption the way we have.
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.580]   In fact, I will move on to something
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.940]   that is deeply corrupt and one of my great battles.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.780]   The corruption of the media and social media.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:16.420]   That is to say, I removed the official advertising.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.980]   That's why you will see
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:21.740]   that even though we generate wonderful news,
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:26.740]   every week in large quantity, the media speak terribly.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.780]   In other words, they demand
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.020]   to have a monopoly on the microphone.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.860]   That is, they are entitled to insult, hurt, offend,
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:36.060]   and they don't want anyone to bother them.
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.820]   And they expect me not to even respond.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.460]   That's why a large part of journalism
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.660]   in Argentina hates the X-Network.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.820]   And that's why we, the liberal libertarians,
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:49.100]   love the X-Network, because we can all say what we want.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.100]   However, let's say these supposed journalists
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.340]   who defend freedom of expression,
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.420]   actually what they want is to censor
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.860]   the ideas they don't like.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.780]   And of course, because they are leftists,
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.900]   because they are wokes,
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.540]   because they can't stand the competition,
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.300]   because if they had to fight face-to-face,
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.540]   hand-to-hand, on a level playing field,
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.580]   when it comes to ideas, they would lose
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.100]   because they were a failure
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.980]   in the economic, social, and cultural aspects.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.460]   And also, we must not forget
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.620]   that those murderers called socialists
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.700]   killed 150 million people.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.940]   So they clearly cannot fight on equal terms.
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:32.020]   Therefore, they demand that social networks have censorship
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.020]   and that the truth cannot be told to them.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:37.820]   Because when you tell a socialist the truth,
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.380]   they cry, claiming it's hate speech.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.660]   No, it's not hate speech.
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.100]   It's that you are useless people
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.540]   who have ruined the planet.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.460]   They have made the planet much worse.
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.020]   And fortunately today, thanks to social media,
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.900]   especially due to the enormous and brave work
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.420]   of Elon Musk and the role of Twitter,
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   today X, right, allows information to flow,
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.420]   which makes it possible.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.860]   Let's say, to expose politicians
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.780]   and also expose the media.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:18.140]   And that's why journalists in Argentina are so violent.
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:18.980]   Why?
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:22.100]   Because before they could, for instance,
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.220]   a journalist went and, for example,
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:27.460]   he would go to a person and he would throw a folder at them
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.780]   and say, "If you don't give me X amount of money,
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.140]   "I am going to publish all of this
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.620]   "and tarnish your reputation."
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:38.820]   And I know for a fact, a case of a journalist
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:43.020]   who carried out this extortion twice to a businessman,
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:46.140]   that businessman told him that he wasn't gonna pay,
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.020]   and evidently the journalist did it.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.620]   Obviously, they went to court, there was a trial,
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.980]   and that journalist lost both times.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.620]   But that process is very slow,
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.540]   and in the meantime, they smeared.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.340]   So since the justice system takes a long time,
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.540]   so what is the problem?
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:06.220]   The problem is that in the meantime, your life got dirtied.
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:09.060]   So why can journalists do all this?
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.220]   Well, that's why they dislike X.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:12.660]   They dislike social media,
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.260]   they dislike the new form of communication
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.500]   because it took away their monopoly over the microphone,
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.340]   and by taking away the monopoly over the microphone,
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.740]   it removed the economic benefits of extortion.
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:28.700]   So clearly, that's another battle I'm fighting.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.940]   You read a newspaper in Argentina
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.420]   and 85% of what you read is a lie.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.740]   That is to say, the fundamental characteristic
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.460]   of most journalists, not all,
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:43.420]   but the vast majority of journalists in Argentina,
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.660]   with some honorable exceptions,
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:50.180]   is that they are liars, slanderers, and defamers.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.460]   And if the monopoly they demand were still in place,
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.540]   that they want to reign again,
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.060]   I have no doubt that they would demand money
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:01.660]   in exchange for silence because that's what they are.
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:05.660]   They are extortionists, they are thieves, they are corrupt.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.900]   And then, of course, obviously,
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.860]   when you take away a privilege from a sector,
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.580]   they get upset.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.940]   Well, welcome to freedom.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.220]   - So you're not only fighting for economic freedom,
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.300]   you're fighting for freedom of speech.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:23.180]   - Exactly, I fight for freedom in all aspects of life.
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:26.180]   That is to say, one of the things
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.100]   that seems most interesting to me
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.420]   is that when the Berlin Wall fell,
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:36.580]   it's true that it officially fell in the year 1989,
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:41.260]   but the reality is that the wall, or socialism,
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:45.980]   fell in the year 1961 when they had to build the wall.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.820]   I mean, they built it because people
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:51.740]   were leaving communist Germany for capitalist Germany.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:56.140]   They realized that those on the Western side
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.860]   were much better off.
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.580]   And, of course, to prevent people from leaving.
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:05.100]   They put, what a wonderful system, right?
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.740]   So, I mean, they had to trap people,
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:08.900]   they couldn't let them go.
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.380]   I mean, these are such wonderful ideas
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.660]   that they had to apply them at gunpoint.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.740]   It's quite, well, it's no coincidence
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.620]   that they killed 150 million human beings.
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.900]   So, what happened then?
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.980]   The official fall of the wall in the year 1989
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:29.660]   made it clear that socialism had failed.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:33.420]   In that context, the socialists,
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:39.580]   they moved the discussion of class struggle in economics
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.340]   and took it to other areas.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.620]   So, for example, socialism,
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.700]   or what is of the 21st century,
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.460]   or cultural Marxism, or post-Marxism,
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.740]   whatever definition you want,
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:58.740]   is to take class struggle to different aspects of life.
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:01.900]   For example, one of the aspects of life
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.460]   where you, let's say, have this is in gender ideology.
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.940]   I mean, it's incredible because the first ones
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.980]   to defend equality before the law were the liberals.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:17.180]   The first to defend women's rights were the liberals.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:20.180]   Jeremy Bentham, in the year 1750,
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.980]   was the first to demand equality before the law for women.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.540]   I mean, the cause of equality,
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:30.460]   equality before the law for women and equality of rights,
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.940]   the first ones who advocated for this were the liberals.
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:33.940]   Did you know?
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.540]   However, what does the left do?
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.820]   They just go on to radicalize it.
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.740]   And then it moves to what is called female chauvinism.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:47.380]   Female chauvinism is, let's say, the fight against males.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.180]   And then, I mean, how do they do it?
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.460]   They do it by assigning rights.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:55.380]   But when you assign a right, someone has to pay for it.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.580]   And that has consequences.
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:01.180]   And in general, let's say, this always happens.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:05.780]   The consequences are that the results are worse
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.900]   than what you had before.
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:10.060]   I mean, in any state intervention,
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:13.740]   the subsequent result is often worse
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.500]   than what you originally had.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.580]   So that's one thing.
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.780]   And not only that, but the other side of this
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.860]   is the environmental agenda,
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.940]   which sets man against nature,
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.940]   involving all aspects of environmentalism
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.940]   and everything related to climate change.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.580]   In other words, they can't stand any serious discussion.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.900]   Therefore, all environmental policies
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:38.060]   are nothing more than an excuse to collect taxes.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:40.500]   So that a group of parasitic bureaucrats
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.620]   can live at the expense of others
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.340]   and finance sinister ideas.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.260]   Where the most sinister idea of all
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.860]   is that there is no room for everyone on planet Earth.
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.340]   That is an idea that failed with Malthus
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.460]   at the beginning of the 19th century,
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:59.420]   a murderous idea that was also applied
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.420]   by the Egyptians against the Jews.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.340]   And this is famously recorded
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.940]   in the book of Shemot or Exodus.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:11.660]   Or for example, another thing is Black Lives Matter.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:14.740]   That is black people against white people
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:18.980]   or indigenous people against the established communities.
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.700]   Or, I mean, everything related to LGBT agendas.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:28.260]   Definitely, these are some of the ways in which,
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.220]   you know, socialism extended the class struggle
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.820]   into other aspects of society,
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.140]   creating divisions and fostering deceit
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:41.460]   with the sole purpose of absorbing taxes.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:44.380]   I mean, what was the Ministry of Women in Argentina doing?
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.180]   Did it manage to reduce a single femicide?
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.020]   No, none at all.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.860]   The number of femicides exploded just the same.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:54.980]   In fact, the most feminist president in Argentine history,
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:58.220]   Mr. Alberto Fernandez, used to beat his wife.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:02.100]   That is such a strange feminist.
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.500]   I mean, well, so within the ranks of feminists,
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.100]   let's say, you will essentially find
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:11.780]   the largest number of rapists and women beaters.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:16.780]   And it's quite interesting what they do.
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.980]   Their hypocrisy is truly striking.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.500]   It's not just about that, though.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:26.220]   I mean, the battle is on three fronts.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.500]   You have the economic front,
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.020]   which is free enterprise capitalism.
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:37.340]   Then we have the political level.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.020]   Currently, the system that the world has designed
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:46.020]   is a Republican liberal democracy with checks and balances.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:51.660]   And I mean, at the cultural battle level,
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.420]   notice that socialism has been very successful
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:55.740]   in the cultural battle.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.660]   It has been very successful politically
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.180]   because it was able to translate that political battle
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.540]   in winning many elections.
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.700]   But why is it falling apart?
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:07.900]   Why?
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.340]   Because it produces misery
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.700]   and because the economic system is a disaster,
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.300]   so people eventually realize
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.300]   that it is making things worse for them.
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:19.580]   Liberal libertarians are very good
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.140]   when it comes to economics.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:26.660]   Yes, and those good economic results can actually lead,
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:30.780]   well, to the generation of solid political processes.
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.100]   But what happened?
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.340]   The liberals neglected the cultural battle.
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:37.820]   Much of the blame was placed on Fukuyama
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.260]   when he said, "This is the end of history."
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:41.860]   No, it was not the end of history
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:44.340]   because the following year, in 1990,
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:47.220]   the socialists gathered at the Sao Paulo Forum
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:49.340]   and based on the ideas of Gramsci,
[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:52.300]   designed a strategy to infiltrate the media,
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.900]   culture, and education,
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.580]   which ended up changing the entire discourse.
[00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.620]   And they established that what they said
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.100]   was politically correct
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.220]   and that any idea outside of it
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.100]   was to be considered reactionary
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.220]   and had to be censored or even persecuted.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.180]   And they claimed to be the ones defending freedom,
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:16.220]   even though they were the ones persecuting people.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.460]   It's the same with journalists who get upset with Twitter.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.940]   They say they defend freedom,
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:24.220]   but can't stand it when those who think differently speak.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.300]   Is that freedom?
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.420]   Yes for them, but not for those who think differently.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.620]   That's not freedom, that's fascism.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.860]   Then, what do we say?
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:35.660]   Then we must fight on the economic front
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.100]   and I believe we are implementing
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.620]   an extremely successful economic program
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.860]   that is being recognized worldwide.
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:45.060]   In fact, the other night,
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.500]   the president-elect, Donald Trump,
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.300]   indeed gave recognition for the achievements
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.100]   we are having in Argentina
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.660]   and the speed at which we have done it.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.260]   At the same time, you have to fight the political battle
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:00.260]   because, well, soccer matches are not won
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.260]   by shouting from the stands,
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:04.860]   they are won by playing on the field.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.740]   But that alone is not enough because you have to,
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:11.420]   let's say, you need to convey to society
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:15.620]   the values of capitalism, the free market,
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:19.900]   what liberalism is, the value of freedom, right?
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.940]   And when you succeed in that,
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:26.100]   then we will indeed be able to advance steadily.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.180]   If you don't fight the cultural battle,
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.780]   what happened in Chile will happen to you.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.580]   They had economic success.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:37.180]   It was, let's say, sustained over time,
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.420]   but at some point it collapsed.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.860]   Why did it collapse?
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.700]   Because they hadn't fought the cultural battle.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.980]   Then socialism, little by little,
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:49.660]   took control of institutions in education and the media.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.980]   So they took over the media and culture,
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.620]   and on that basis, they attacked and broke up the system.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.900]   And then they found themselves
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.180]   with increasing doses of socialism,
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.980]   and the only thing socialism generates is poverty.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.540]   Therefore, what you must keep in mind
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:11.140]   is that you have to fight the battles on all fronts.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.140]   And if you don't keep that in mind,
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:17.620]   I can tell you are headed towards collapse.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.060]   - Like you said, in this fight against corruption,
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.780]   you're challenging some very powerful people,
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.260]   a powerful establishment.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:29.340]   Are you ever afraid for your life?
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:33.100]   Potential assassinations?
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.700]   - No.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:39.700]   Tell me, what good is it to live life, I mean, in slavery?
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:46.620]   Look, there is a song by a Spanish singer
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.780]   called Nino Bravo.
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:52.340]   Just to be clear, he has already left this earth
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.180]   so we can say he has passed on to the beyond.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.340]   The song is called "Libre."
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:05.340]   And the song, it tells the story of Peter Fetcher,
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:10.340]   an 18-year-old boy who, when the separation was made,
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:17.420]   and I mean, the construction of the Berlin Wall begins,
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.580]   his family ends up on the Western side
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.980]   and he accidentally ends up on the Eastern side.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:28.100]   And for a whole year, he plans his escape
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.460]   to the Western side, right?
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:33.860]   And in that context, when he tries to escape,
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.980]   he gets murdered.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.900]   So really, what is the point of life
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.740]   if it's not in freedom, right?
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.700]   I mean, what is the point of living
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.340]   without fighting for your values?
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.620]   If I am willing to give my life for my values,
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.260]   then what is the point of living without freedom?
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.140]   Look, can I tell you something interesting
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.500]   that happened to me here in the United States?
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:04.180]   I, let's say, back in the year 1998,
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:10.180]   I came to the United States to take a series of courses
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.380]   to improve my English,
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:15.980]   which I never use in formal terms
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.100]   because as president, as you can imagine,
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:21.060]   if I make a mistake, I can create a serious situation.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:27.220]   Fortunately, I have an interpreter who is a superstar,
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:30.020]   and if I make a mistake, even in Spanish,
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.980]   he corrects me in the version of the other language.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:37.900]   And so back then, in that year, I went to San Francisco
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.460]   and I visited Alcatraz.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:48.540]   You're young, but I mean, the visit was an audio tour.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:55.580]   You got a Walkman and you would choose the different tracks
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.060]   and listen to the story.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.900]   The most interesting thing is that the Alcatraz tour
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.100]   ended in the recreation yard
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.260]   where the basketball court, exercise areas,
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.900]   and all recreational facilities were located.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.620]   So anyone would have thought
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.300]   that this was the best part of Alcatraz.
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:19.340]   And yet, what they said in the guide
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:22.700]   was that that was the hardest part for the inmates.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:23.540]   Why?
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:26.220]   Because I mean, that recreation area in particular
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:31.180]   is built in front of the San Francisco Bay.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:35.820]   So the inmates could all see how San Francisco
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:39.900]   continued to build up and evolve and develop every day.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.380]   While they were locked up in there,
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.340]   they couldn't take part in that.
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.460]   They were confined in that prison
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:50.540]   and that made them fully aware of the value of freedom.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:55.220]   So in my experience, for me,
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.900]   the fight for freedom is relentless, okay?
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.180]   I mean, my greatest hero in all of human history is Moses.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.500]   The feat of Moses is like one person alone
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.540]   with his brother Aaron,
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:15.500]   both confronting the combined forces of the United States,
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:19.460]   China, and Russia together.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.740]   And it was Moses who said to Ramses, "Let my people go."
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:30.300]   Well, Ramses resisted and the forces of heaven ran him over.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.420]   But what I mean is,
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:37.820]   I don't see any other possible way to live
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.500]   other than with freedom.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.140]   And I would always fight for full freedom
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.740]   and I would be at the forefront of this cause.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:50.740]   I mean, it's a cause that I'm going to die with my boots on.
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.380]   I mean, I'm not going to make do with living
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.740]   any other way other than with freedom.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.740]   I will fight everything I'm gonna fight as much as it takes.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.980]   At least that's the way I feel.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.220]   So what good is it to be alive if you're confined?
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.460]   What good is it to be alive if you're not free?
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.300]   It's no good.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:14.500]   What good was it for Peter Fetcher
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.580]   to be alive in communist Germany?
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:24.540]   Well, at least he had a moment of happiness
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.940]   while he tried to escape.
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.860]   - Another guy who fights for freedom,
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:33.740]   freedom of speech in this case is your new friend, Elon Musk.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.900]   What do you admire and what have you learned
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.860]   from your interactions with Elon?
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:44.180]   - I have a huge admiration for Elon Musk.
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:53.340]   He is an absolutely unconventional person.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:57.780]   He's a great fighter for the ideas of freedom.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:01.220]   What he has done on Twitter, now known as X,
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:06.220]   and how he is helping the world nowadays
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:12.900]   to wake up once and for all and become aware
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.540]   of the socialist virus, the woke virus,
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.980]   that in itself makes him a hero in the history of humanity.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:23.540]   But it's not just that.
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.980]   One of the things that happened to me
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:30.380]   is that when I went to first talk to him,
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:35.380]   I thought I was going to meet a successful businessman
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.580]   and that I would have
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:40.060]   a typical successful businessman conversation
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:43.020]   who understands business and that some of his businesses,
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.140]   some of his business slightly more exotic,
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:50.900]   but that's the kind of talk you would expect to have.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:55.340]   And business people are truly admirable, right?
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.780]   Because they are true benefactors of society,
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:04.300]   but they're usually very much focused on their own business.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:10.100]   And one of the things that really, really shocked me
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.100]   when I met Elon Musk,
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:19.220]   we had scheduled a meeting for no more than 15 minutes.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.820]   The first time we were in the meeting
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.140]   for a little over 45 minutes
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.060]   because he was about to miss his flight.
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.740]   So obviously, if someone as important as him
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:34.220]   doesn't fly as planned, it has to be rescheduled
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.660]   and he loses a lot of hours.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:39.340]   Imagine, every minute is very valuable.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:45.260]   And one of the things that happened was that,
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:50.660]   basically, he brought up the topic of demography
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.660]   and we started discussing demographics and growth.
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:59.100]   I never imagined that I would end up discussing demographics
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.060]   and growth with him, you know?
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:05.020]   And another very fun thing was that,
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:09.100]   something funny he said to me was that,
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.700]   since we shared our vision regarding demographic issues
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:16.580]   and the need to populate the planet, he asked me,
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.140]   "Now, what about you?
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.740]   When are you going to move in that direction?"
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.140]   I mean, I said, "Oh, look, I have five children."
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.060]   And he said, "Well, the four-legged ones don't count."
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:31.140]   That was the first meeting I had with Elon Musk.
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:35.380]   The second, the second meeting was
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:39.940]   when here at the universities,
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.980]   we started seeing anti-Semitic demonstrations
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:46.900]   where basically Palestinian flags were displayed
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.340]   and Jews were harassed and persecuted.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.620]   And at that moment, when we had that second meeting,
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:00.220]   he showed himself to be very deeply involved with that
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:04.060]   and brought up the issue of the cultural battle.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:07.820]   So, I mean, it's not quite conventional
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.620]   even in the political field.
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:15.580]   During our last talk,
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:18.180]   which lasted for about two and a half hours, right?
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:22.700]   One of the things we talked about was freedom
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.700]   and what was at stake for the United States in this election.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:34.740]   Therefore, he is a person, you know, honestly,
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:40.020]   I can say he is well above average.
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:45.020]   I mean, a person of unconventional intelligence, right?
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:48.020]   And also, he is very charming.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:52.820]   So, I mean, again, I have a great admiration for him
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:56.700]   and I really interact very closely with him.
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.380]   He is very interested
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.780]   in what our Ministry of Deregulation is doing,
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.620]   which seeks to remove regulations.
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.140]   But at the same time, he works with another person
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.260]   who is also interested in the chainsaw approach.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.140]   And so, I'm very pleased
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.500]   because they are going to try and replicate
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.460]   the model we are implementing in Argentina.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.340]   And also, Donald Trump himself
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.180]   is very enthusiastic about this.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.860]   So, and anything in the way of reducing regulations
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:31.580]   and cutting public spending
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.620]   and taking government out of the equation
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.060]   means more freedom for the people.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.740]   So, I'm very pleased with what's going on.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.860]   And with Trump's victory,
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:44.420]   because the United States will be better off,
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.700]   Argentina is going to be better too.
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.820]   And the whole world is going to be better off.
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:51.580]   Today, the world is a much better place
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:54.140]   than it was just a few days ago.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:57.180]   - Like you said, Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:01.020]   are heading the DOGE, Department of Government Efficiency.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:03.060]   So, from your experience this year
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.740]   as President of Argentina
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.940]   and every chainsaw economic policies
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.260]   that you've implemented,
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.820]   what advice would you give to Elon and Vivek
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.820]   about how to do it in the United States?
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.700]   - Just cut to the chase.
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:17.980]   Cut to the chase.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.140]   Simple as that.
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.500]   I'll tell you a story and you're going to love it.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:26.140]   Currently in Argentina,
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.540]   due to the political balance we've achieved,
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:33.820]   we have had certain powers delegated from Congress
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:35.500]   to the executive branch.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.660]   And therefore, we can resolve it by decree.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:44.340]   The deregulation minister, Federico Storzenega,
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.820]   in his ministry,
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.540]   shows a counter that displays in front of everyone there.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.540]   He displays the number of days, all right,
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:59.220]   during which the delegated powers will continue to be valid.
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:04.220]   Therefore, he has a whole deregulation division,
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.220]   also a public spending cut division,
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:10.620]   and government structure reduction division.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:14.380]   And he also has an elite core that's cleaning up
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:17.540]   all of the laws that hinder the economic system
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.300]   and progress.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.340]   And every day,
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.900]   he removes between one and five economic restrictions.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.780]   So, my advice would be for them to go all the way,
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.300]   to push it to the very limit.
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:33.500]   And do not give up.
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.900]   Do not let down their guard.
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.860]   Furthermore, that agenda does not have political purpose,
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.340]   because at the end of the day,
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:43.900]   you are removing privileges.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.260]   Of course, there will be people complaining,
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.020]   but those are people,
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.900]   these are people who are losing privileges.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:52.380]   So, they will have to explain to society
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.780]   why they are keeping those privileges.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:57.060]   And that is quite uncomfortable.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.180]   - You've spoken with Donald Trump.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.540]   Allegedly, he called you his favorite president.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.660]   What did you discuss?
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.820]   And maybe again,
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.780]   what do you admire about President Trump?
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.500]   And what do you learn from him?
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:13.660]   - There are several things that I,
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.140]   I admire about President Trump.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:20.340]   The first is that he probably,
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.660]   I think he's provided ample proof of this
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.700]   in his first presidency.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:28.420]   He understands the nature of the cultural battle.
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:32.380]   He has openly confronted socialism.
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.820]   His speeches openly target socialism.
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:39.260]   He perfectly understands the woke virus.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:44.940]   And that is, you know,
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.260]   of great value,
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.380]   because it means understanding what it's all about.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:54.740]   Another thing I truly admire about him is his courage.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:55.660]   In fact,
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:16:00.140]   thankfully, thank goodness,
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:03.300]   he didn't get assassinated or killed.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.620]   But it was by a small chance occurrence
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.980]   that could have killed him,
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.180]   just because he moved at the right moment.
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:15.220]   And yet, that didn't intimidate him.
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.700]   And he went on.
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.820]   And in fact,
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:21.780]   during his first campaign,
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.260]   and in this one as well,
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.380]   in the second one and third one,
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:31.260]   they criticized him, insulted him, offended him,
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.260]   said awful things about him,
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.140]   made up all sorts of horrible stories about him.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:41.500]   In that respect, I can say I deeply relate,
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:45.620]   because probably no one in our history
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.820]   has had such a negative campaign
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.780]   from all the media like they did to me.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:54.620]   But let's say they were quite similar.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.100]   This is why it's so interesting.
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.300]   And I was so deeply moved when last night
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.940]   I also got to meet Sylvester Stallone.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.620]   You know?
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:08.260]   Because Sylvester Stallone talks about,
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:12.660]   well, how important is that no matter how hard they hit you
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:15.140]   and keep on hitting you all the time,
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:18.260]   despite all that, you keep going on and on and on.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:23.740]   What I'm trying to say is that many of the,
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:29.580]   many, so many of Sylvester Stallone's approaches
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:32.420]   are truly inspirational, don't you think?
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:35.420]   So imagine, I'm about to give the speech
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:39.620]   and I see Sylvester Stallone and Sylvester Stallone knows me.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.580]   It was truly insane.
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:43.220]   I had to pinch myself.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.220]   I mean, this can't be true.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.580]   And besides, well,
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:50.060]   the people were wonderful with me last night.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.900]   They've been wonderful today.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.700]   I've taken hundreds of selfies.
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.420]   I mean, it's truly been,
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.340]   I would say it's been my break, let me say,
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.580]   after almost a year in office
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.300]   and having to face all sorts of media torture
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:10.820]   because the journalists who have vested interests
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:14.700]   and are corrupt are professional torturers.
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.500]   Yes, because they invade your personal life,
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.260]   your family, and your privacy.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.620]   Let me tell you something to show you
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.620]   the kind of garbage the media in Argentina can do.
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.300]   They sent three drones to spy on me
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:29.980]   at my presidential residence, to spy on me.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:31.780]   Do you think that's right?
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.620]   - No. - Exactly.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.580]   But that kind of thing happens in Argentina,
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.300]   not to mention the many lies and horrible things they say.
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.020]   I, for instance, remember that time
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:45.020]   when my father was hospitalized.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.420]   My father is a man of a really strong character
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:52.500]   who has had two heart surgeries, all right?
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.540]   And one day a journalist was saying
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.660]   all sorts of lies about my father.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:02.780]   My father was hospitalized and, well,
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.900]   and he almost died of a heart attack.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.900]   So that kind of thing is what journalism
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:10.020]   and the press do in Argentina.
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:13.020]   So they start to attack your private life,
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.980]   your mother, your father, your sister,
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.540]   even my dogs that I absolutely adore.
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:20.580]   They are the most wonderful beings in the universe.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:23.220]   They even target my four-legged children.
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:27.660]   So imagine that I've been in office for nearly a year,
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:30.220]   a year as president,
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.420]   and since they can't criticize my management
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:37.780]   except by lying and distorting the numbers,
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.180]   they meddle with all these things,
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.260]   things they have been doing all the time
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:47.260]   since the year 2021, when I officially entered politics.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:52.860]   So, and I've seen what they've done to Trump.
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:57.300]   So that also makes me relate a lot to him
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:58.740]   because he's a true warrior.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:02.660]   He's truly, he's a Viking, he's a Viking,
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.140]   he's literally a Viking.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:08.660]   I mean, he is someone I admire
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:13.220]   for how he has kept fighting in the face of adversity,
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:17.460]   even against all odds, and still he managed to win.
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:19.300]   Amazing.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:26.220]   And well, and that's why I can relate that much.
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.980]   And I've also seen how he's been unfairly criticized,
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:33.140]   like when he was accused of protectionism
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.500]   or when he wanted to discuss some matters
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.100]   within the context of public debate
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:43.180]   regarding the design of monetary policy as regards the Fed.
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:48.180]   And basically they have accused him of things.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:52.260]   I mean, isn't he entitled to give an opinion as a president?
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.780]   I mean, any citizen could give their opinion,
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.860]   even more so a president.
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.220]   Why is it important to you
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.540]   that Argentina has a close relationship
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:01.700]   with the United States?
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:06.580]   Well, to us, that is truly important, okay?
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:12.540]   You know, because we've decided to be geopolitical allies
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.420]   of the United States ever since our campaign,
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:21.700]   that our allies, we have decided that our allies
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:23.900]   will be the United States and Israel,
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:27.220]   because they basically represent
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:29.300]   the ideas of the Western world,
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.580]   they represent the free world.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.860]   That is to say what we would call today,
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:37.020]   let's say a liberal democracy, okay,
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:40.580]   by confronting the autocrats.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:44.780]   And in that sense, that is the geopolitical alignment.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.780]   Moreover, in our campaign,
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.580]   we were very, very clear on three main points.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.940]   One, the economic pillar.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:55.060]   We talked about cutting public spending
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.060]   and I would make my appearances with a chainsaw.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:01.340]   We talked about economic freedom, deregulation, that is,
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.300]   and I talked about a competition of currencies
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:07.500]   and people, you know, obviously were interested in the dollar
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.900]   so it was obvious that the economic policy was clear.
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:11.740]   All right?
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.980]   And not only was it clear, but we are also fulfilling it.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.980]   That is the first point.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.460]   Second was our policy on security.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.580]   The idea being to fight crime,
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:26.460]   I mean, relentlessly, as well as security.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.300]   No mercy, right?
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:33.300]   And in fact, in Argentina, there are no more roadblocks
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.980]   which they said were impossible to end.
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:39.820]   Not only that, we have strengthened the security forces
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.580]   and also our armed forces,
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:44.580]   and we are waging a tough battle against drug trafficking
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.140]   and narco-terrorism.
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.980]   Therefore, we are also strongly fulfilling that.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:53.020]   Notice that these two points which were the main concerns,
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.380]   they were the biggest concerns of Argentinians
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:59.620]   when we took office are now in fifth and sixth place.
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:02.980]   Today, the problem for Argentinians is corruption.
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.460]   Whether there is unemployment, if there is poverty,
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:10.580]   but they don't mention inflation and insecurity anymore.
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:13.340]   And besides, a third point that I made clear
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:15.820]   was that I would align with the United States
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.900]   and Israel internationally.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:21.820]   And, you know, at my campaign rallies,
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.980]   there would be groups that would come along
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.740]   with flags of Israel.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:30.540]   So it's clear that our international policy approach
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:32.660]   was always very clear.
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:37.220]   And this is something I state during my speeches
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.660]   when I talk about the values of the West
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:42.100]   and the civilization of the West.
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:47.100]   In fact, yesterday, and even more so today,
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:50.980]   during my speeches, I talked about
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.100]   how the different Greek groups or tribes
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.940]   go together to confront the Persians.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:02.260]   That is to say, it seemed that from that time,
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:05.500]   500 years before Christ until today,
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.740]   that struggle continues, right?
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:14.740]   But well, so, of course, we're all in.
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:18.580]   We are betting on the United States
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:23.140]   becoming once again a leader in the West.
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:29.020]   We needed someone to come back to make America great again.
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:34.540]   And as part of that process,
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:39.140]   being a commercial ally is also a great idea.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.820]   So we would really like to move forward
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:46.820]   and deepen our trade ties and our investment ties, you know?
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:52.500]   And well, we would also like to be part of the NATO as well.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.100]   - Do you think it's still possible,
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.020]   one of the radical ideas you had
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.500]   as you were running for president
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:02.060]   was to dollarize the Argentine economy?
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.060]   Do you think that's still a good idea?
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:05.860]   Are you still thinking about that?
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.300]   - Let's see, let's break it down.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:12.300]   Let's say I, if you review all my statements,
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:15.300]   I talk about currency competition.
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:19.700]   I'm not strictly talking about dollarization.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.660]   I'm talking about currency competition
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.060]   and eliminating the central bank.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.180]   If people later decide to embrace the dollar,
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:29.020]   that is their choice.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.380]   Ultimately, in the model I propose,
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:34.380]   what happens is the formation of a currency basket
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.460]   tailored to the needs of individuals.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:41.380]   But I won't avoid the discussion.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.540]   Today, there is currency competition.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.460]   If, for instance, today in Argentina,
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.860]   you want to make transactions in any currency,
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.980]   you can do it and it's allowed.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:52.300]   Today, there is currency competition.
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:54.980]   The other thing we talk about is the concept of,
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:57.740]   let's suppose we were discussing dollarization,
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:00.140]   we talk about endogenous dollarization.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:03.340]   The first point is that
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:06.140]   you need to clean up the central bank.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:09.060]   We had to deal with the issue of the CIRA,
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.980]   that is the central bank's commercial debt,
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.780]   which was $50 billion.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:14.820]   We still have to resolve the dividend problem
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:16.580]   of $10 billion.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:19.140]   And in the meantime, we did a write-off
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.140]   and cleaned up the central bank's balance sheet
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.140]   by $45 billion.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.860]   So you can't just close the central bank
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:28.020]   if it is bankrupt because you need to redeem
[01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:29.540]   the whole central bank debt,
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.260]   which is about the issuing of money
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.260]   and the interest-bearing liabilities.
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:37.020]   So once we finished with the interest-bearing liabilities,
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.340]   it'll leave us with the monetary base.
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:42.540]   Therefore, today we have a regime
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.700]   where the amount of money is fixed,
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.940]   the monetary base is not growing,
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:49.060]   and as demand for money increases
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:51.460]   since people can use dollars,
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.780]   they don't need to go and sell the dollars
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:56.020]   and make the peso appreciate,
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:59.180]   but they can do transactions in dollars.
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.980]   So as the economy grows,
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:03.380]   you will have a greater share of dollars
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:05.180]   relative to pesos.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.540]   And at some point,
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.780]   the amount of pesos compared to the dollars
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:12.980]   will be so huge, relatively,
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.980]   that closing down the central bank
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.580]   will be done easily,
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:18.340]   which means this is working.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:23.020]   Of course, if you were to give me the money right now,
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:25.620]   I would go ahead and dollarize.
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.420]   I'd have no problem with that.
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:30.780]   For example, I did have a proposal for this
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:32.540]   and this could have worked
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.420]   because the bonds,
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:35.940]   because the largest creditor
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.580]   of the Argentine treasury is the central bank,
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:43.340]   but central bank bonds were trading at 20 cents.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:45.700]   If I had sold those bonds at 20 cents,
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:50.300]   and nowadays they are trading between 60 and 70
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:53.700]   with the whole bunch of Neanderthals
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.940]   that are the opposition,
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:00.340]   who besides being ignorant in economics,
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:03.380]   also have bad intentions,
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.500]   I would be in jail today.
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.340]   - Let me ask you a very important, difficult question.
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.060]   I'm a huge fan,
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:12.060]   have been my whole life,
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:15.180]   of Diego Mardona and Messi.
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:18.740]   So, who to you is the greatest football player of all time?
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:19.700]   - The way I see it,
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.900]   I have seen Maradona play, all right.
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:26.260]   I saw Maradona play in the past,
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.420]   I used to watch him,
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:32.140]   and I saw him during his last year at Argentino Juniors,
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:36.020]   before Boca Juniors in the year 1980,
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.980]   and I saw him in '81.
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.100]   Playing for Boca,
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:43.860]   I saw him play in the youth selection in Japan in 1979.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:49.820]   I truly have immensely enjoyed the talent of Maradona,
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:54.820]   but without a doubt,
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:57.020]   the best soccer player of all time,
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.180]   not just from Argentina,
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:28:59.540]   of all time,
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:01.900]   even better than Pelé,
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:04.100]   is Messi, of course.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:08.100]   There is an article which is quite old already now,
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.260]   titled "Messi is Impossible",
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.740]   and it looks at all of the positions
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.260]   a soccer player plays in.
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:23.180]   That is, all positions a soccer player can play in
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:25.180]   from midfield forward, okay?
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:30.020]   And the most incredible thing is that Messi
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:34.940]   is the best in each of those positions.
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:39.260]   You can be the best in one or two positions.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.700]   You see, Cristiano Ronaldo, for example,
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:46.100]   was very good in two areas of the game,
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:49.900]   so much so that he was almost like Messi,
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:52.860]   but he didn't take part in the rest.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:56.380]   However, Messi is the best one in all respects,
[01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.300]   but at that time, of course.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:02.860]   Nowadays, you know, he is an older player, right?
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:07.900]   And I'm not sure
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:11.660]   whether he can still keep that performance on all fronts,
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.900]   but honestly, I have never in my life
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.740]   seen a player like Messi.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:20.580]   I have never seen no one like him, for real.
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:23.780]   If you look at the number of goals he scored,
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:24.620]   I correct that,
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:27.540]   considering the goal average in the days of Pelé,
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:31.300]   compared to Messi's golden era and his career now,
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.180]   the number of equivalent goals
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.340]   is much greater than that of Pelé.
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.460]   Therefore, without a doubt,
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:41.260]   Messi is the greatest soccer player of all time,
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:44.540]   of all time, no one compares to him.
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:48.100]   - But it's not just the numbers or the World Cup win.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:52.980]   It's the moments of genius on the field.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:56.140]   Messi is unlike any other in that way.
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:59.660]   - Messi does things that seem technically impossible.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:02.580]   They seem physically impossible.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.140]   The moves he makes don't respect human logic.
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:08.180]   It's like watching Usain Bolt run.
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.620]   It doesn't feel possible.
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:14.740]   He moves in a way that doesn't respect human logic.
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.420]   Am I right?
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:19.580]   - Did you watch the 1986 World Cup with Maradona,
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:22.700]   with the hand of God, with the game against England?
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.060]   What was that like?
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.340]   - Oh, yes.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.340]   I do remember that very well.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:34.500]   We watched it in the home of my godfather,
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.220]   and saw how he did his gambit,
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:40.180]   and dodged the team, the England team.
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:44.540]   That was truly, it was absolutely,
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:48.500]   absolutely indescribable.
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.620]   There's no way to put it into words.
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:54.740]   It's as if I asked you to describe for me
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:59.020]   the love you have for your partner.
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.060]   You can't do that, right?
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:04.300]   I mean, it's something wonderful.
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:08.460]   You can't describe it, you cannot put it into words.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.740]   There are things where words,
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:15.740]   I mean, you know, just seem to fail.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.100]   Am I right?
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:21.300]   I really think that there are times when humans,
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:27.860]   or some humans, not all of them, actually,
[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.300]   some humans have the privilege
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:34.140]   of being able to vibrate closer to God.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:37.460]   Some Puccini arias, for example,
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:38.660]   when you listen to them,
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:43.660]   when you listen to the famous aria from La Rondine,
[01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:47.300]   or the famous aria from Gianni Schicci,
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:49.180]   I mean, you get the feeling
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:51.660]   that he was getting satictated by God.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:54.060]   How can you put that into words?
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.260]   You can't.
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:56.620]   There's no way you do that.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:59.700]   I mean, those moments where we humans are
[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.660]   that we have the privilege.
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:05.460]   I say it as human beings, right?
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:08.740]   Because, I mean, I'm speaking from that perspective.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:10.340]   Okay?
[01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:14.140]   I say this only as an admirer.
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:16.620]   Some human beings have the ability
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:20.500]   to vibrate so close to God that you can't describe it.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:22.180]   You can only enjoy it.
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:25.620]   This is why in Judaism,
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:29.740]   they don't use the name of God, of the Creator,
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:35.100]   because how could you put in words something like that?
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.020]   And I believe those are times
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:42.020]   when us humans connect closer to the Creator
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:45.820]   and create things, unique things.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.020]   You cannot describe them.
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:49.060]   There are no words to describe that.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:51.220]   The only thing you can do is enjoy it
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:54.460]   and be thankful that you can witness it.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:00.180]   - You were a great footballer yourself in your youth.
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:01.660]   You were a goalkeeper.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.780]   Many people would say that's the toughest
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:06.260]   and the most important position in football.
[01:34:06.260 --> 01:34:08.300]   Maybe you could speak about that experience
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:09.620]   and in general, what's harder,
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.260]   being a goalkeeper or president?
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:14.540]   - Lovely question.
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:18.260]   Well, indeed.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.300]   I used to be a goalkeeper,
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:22.860]   but I'm not so sure about whether I was any good.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:29.220]   But the experience of having been a goalkeeper
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.860]   is very valuable.
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:36.820]   First, the goalkeeper is the only player
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.380]   that can use their hands
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:43.020]   in a certain sector of the pitch, in the area.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:49.980]   The other thing is that he's also the only player
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:51.580]   who dresses differently, right?
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:57.380]   Moreover, their training is a solitary one.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:02.260]   And the most important,
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:09.500]   I mean, it is the very climax, the goal, right?
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:12.620]   When the goal is called by their team,
[01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:14.700]   everyone is celebrating on the other side
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.380]   and the goalkeeper is on his own.
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:22.220]   And at the same time,
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.780]   he is the one who suffers the most
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:28.340]   when a goal is scored because he gets the direct impact.
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.460]   In fact, when the goalkeeper makes a mistake,
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:32.620]   it's an own goal.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:36.500]   Imagine a teammate scores a wonderful goal
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.300]   like the one Maradona did.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:39.540]   It's marvelous.
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:41.620]   And that's just one goal.
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:44.020]   And imagine the goalkeeper picks up the ball
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.900]   and then if they bring it into the area wrongly,
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.740]   it's like two goals.
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:51.100]   It's a complete lack of proportion.
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:53.540]   So therefore,
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:58.020]   and this, in my opinion,
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:02.460]   makes goalkeepers have a very strong temperament, right?
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:05.860]   They are used to being alone.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.300]   And power is precisely that.
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:12.340]   Because when you make decisions, you are on your own.
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:18.180]   And not just that, but also,
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:22.180]   when you have a responsibility,
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:24.260]   like that of a president,
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:25.540]   when you make a decision,
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:27.980]   it has an impact on millions of people.
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:31.900]   So just like goalkeepers,
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:34.620]   if you make a mistake and score an own goal,
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.060]   and in this context,
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:40.780]   it's negative consequences for millions of people.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:45.500]   Therefore, that has been part of the university of life
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:49.540]   that has given me the tools to be president today.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:51.620]   That is my training in economics,
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.660]   my training in liberalism,
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.300]   having been a goalkeeper,
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:59.180]   and also having had a very tough childhood.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.620]   - How hard is it?
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:03.580]   What's been the personal toll of carrying
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:06.060]   the hope of a nation on your shoulders?
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:10.060]   - Well, being defamed, insulted,
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.660]   and attacked every single day.
[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:13.980]   But,
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:20.060]   but again, there's no point in life
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:21.460]   if it's not with freedom.
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:25.180]   So like Sylvester Stallone once said,
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:27.700]   "The secret to life is to carry on
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:29.700]   "in spite of the blows you get,
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.380]   "the punches you take."
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:36.060]   And fortunately, we have been able to carry on
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:39.060]   in spite of the blows,
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:42.860]   both coming at us from in front and from behind our backs,
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:44.220]   because it would have been more honest
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:46.620]   if we had been attacked directly.
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:48.820]   But well, you know, in Argentina,
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:53.580]   politics and the mass media,
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:57.180]   they do love to attack behind your back.
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:59.820]   - What role has God played in your life?
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:01.980]   And who is God?
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:07.060]   - Well, faith, I'd say, has been
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:12.420]   a very fundamental element, you know?
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.260]   And
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:20.420]   especially in recent times,
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:23.500]   during which I've become actively involved,
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.260]   particularly in the teachings of Judaism
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:30.780]   and in the study of the Torah.
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:36.180]   This has given me a huge,
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:40.540]   let's say, a huge background
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:43.860]   to face the many adversities which I've encountered
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.940]   and had to overcome in the last few years.
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:48.420]   And as to who God is,
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.740]   he's the creator, the maker.
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:53.100]   I call him the one.
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.940]   - What is a better guide for humanity,
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:39:00.260]   the invisible hand of the market or the hand of God?
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:02.300]   - They're perfectly in sync.
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:05.380]   - Well enough.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:07.500]   Again, going back to your youth,
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.140]   you were a lead singer in a rock band.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:12.780]   Who is the greatest rock star of all time?
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.340]   - Okay.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.220]   Well, the way I see it,
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:21.180]   the most amazing rock singer in history of mankind
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.060]   was definitely Elvis Presley.
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:28.140]   And my favorite band is the Rolling Stones.
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:33.500]   So I also greatly admire Mick Jagger, you know?
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.860]   And I still have this dream
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:38.500]   of getting to meet him in person.
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:42.180]   - How fun would it be to play together with the Stones?
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:46.900]   - That would be a big, big dream.
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:51.300]   Don't get my hopes up
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:54.220]   because I set goals and then I go and achieve them.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:56.780]   - Well, I'm close friends with a band
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:57.900]   that opens for the Stones.
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:00.460]   So I would love to see this happen.
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.220]   - Oh, well, that would be great.
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:06.900]   Or we could also watch the whole concert from the stage.
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:11.700]   I mean, I can't keep ruining the Rolling Stones' music.
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.420]   I already had a tribute band
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:16.340]   and did quite a lot of damage to their music.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:18.620]   - How much of your rock star roots
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:20.900]   define your approach to politics, to life?
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:25.380]   Do you see yourself as a kind of showman in part?
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:26.300]   - Of course.
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:29.100]   Absolutely.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:34.100]   My idea is that when you attend one of our events,
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:38.300]   it feels like going to a Rolling Stones concert.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.620]   In fact, in one of my most recent performances
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:46.140]   at Luna Park, I even had the pleasure of singing
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.100]   in front of 10,000 people.
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.220]   It's on YouTube.
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:52.580]   No, sorry.
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:54.380]   Not on YouTube.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:55.900]   It's on my Instagram feed.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:01.420]   At that event, I sang a song called "Panic Show"
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:04.820]   and the song starts by saying, "Hi, everybody.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:06.820]   I am the lion."
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.740]   - Your intensity and passion
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:11.740]   have earned you the nickname El Loco, the madman.
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:15.420]   Do you think some madness is necessary
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:19.140]   to challenge the powerful establishment?
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:22.300]   - Well, maybe it's a matter of perspective, right?
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.580]   It could be the other way around,
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.580]   that everyone else is crazy by living in a way
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:30.580]   contrary to the ideas of freedom.
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.820]   And so maybe the same person who wants to fix that
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:36.460]   is then considered a madman.
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:41.020]   Anyway, the nickname doesn't bother me at all.
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:43.700]   In fact, I even enjoy it because I've been called like that
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:44.860]   since I was 10 years old.
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:49.540]   So it's not something that particularly bothers me,
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:53.260]   you know, because it's a nickname that,
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:57.460]   well, it has been used for many years.
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:02.340]   But actually, if I present to you the case of San Martin,
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:06.740]   when he said he was going to cross the Andes to liberate
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:09.780]   not only Argentina, not only our country,
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:13.820]   but also Chile and Peru, and people called him crazy.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:18.260]   Imagine if you had tried and spoken with, I don't know,
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:22.660]   with Michelangelo, you would have called him crazy too.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:26.860]   Or if you had talked to, I don't know,
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:29.140]   hundreds of people who have changed the world,
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:32.580]   surely they would have thought that Einstein was crazy
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.820]   and so on, the list would be infinite.
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:39.260]   So what is the difference between a madman
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.460]   and a genius?
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.180]   Success.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:48.260]   - Let me ask you about the market.
[01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:52.580]   It's so interesting from your view of the world,
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.020]   how powerful the market is at figuring out
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:57.060]   what's best for society.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:59.820]   Why do you think the market works so well
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:01.620]   as a guide for humanity?
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:06.700]   - One must first understand what the market is.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:12.940]   Simply put, the market is a process of voluntary exchange
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:15.700]   where individuals cooperate through the transfer
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:20.700]   of property rights in which private property is upheld.
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:27.940]   This is the system that drives the allocation of resources.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:32.340]   In essence, socialism, and this is what Mises condemns
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:35.700]   in his book "Socialism", shows is that
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:41.180]   without private property, prices cease to exist,
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.420]   and therefore resources are diverted.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:44.580]   Why don't you think it's the same
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.540]   to make a road of asphalt or gold?
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:48.260]   Why not make it of gold?
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:51.420]   Because you have an understanding of economic calculation,
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:54.060]   you have an idea of prices in your mind.
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:59.060]   So in this context, if there is no private property,
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:00.780]   there are no prices.
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:05.780]   And as a result, the free market capitalism, you know,
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:10.340]   is the best mechanism ever developed by humankind
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:13.060]   for resource allocation.
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:16.540]   This also implies that markets must be free,
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:18.940]   free from state intervention,
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:21.460]   because when the state intervenes,
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:23.900]   it creates interference.
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:28.740]   And markets need to allow free entry and exit,
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:31.020]   what we call competition.
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.540]   However, it's better to understand competition
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:36.900]   in the sense described by Israel Gerstner,
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:39.620]   one of the foremost figures of the Austrian school,
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:42.060]   or in the neoclassical framework
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:44.340]   as William Baumol understood it,
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:46.980]   which was the concept of free entry and exit
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:49.740]   in so-called contestable markets.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:52.780]   And also, let's talk about what pertains
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:56.220]   to the division of labor and social cooperation.
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:00.460]   You know, the most wonderful thing about capitalism
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:03.380]   is that you can only be successful by serving others
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:06.900]   with better quality goods at a better price.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:10.820]   If you are successful in the free market capitalism,
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:13.420]   you are a hero, you are a social benefactor,
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:15.340]   you are a prosperity machine.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:19.620]   So the better you do, you know,
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:24.380]   the better you do, the better it is for society.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:25.340]   This is very important.
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:28.060]   I remember when I had my first meeting with Elon Musk,
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:32.220]   and this made me admire him greatly.
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:36.580]   And this is something my sister commented on too.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:40.660]   You know, Elon Musk told me something he does every day.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:42.980]   He wakes up every morning thinking about
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:48.660]   what problem he could fix for humanity.
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:49.940]   That's amazing.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.900]   Of course, what is the counterpart?
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.180]   Being successful.
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:59.180]   Therefore, in that sense,
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:04.180]   and moreover, in my view on how the system works,
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:08.900]   on how the market works, market failures do not exist.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:11.300]   That is to say, that is a problem.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:16.780]   All right, a problem for neoclassical economies
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.820]   because of the mathematical tools they've used
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:24.700]   to develop economic analysis,
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:29.500]   but actually it's not a real issue in everyday life.
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:32.140]   It's a problem in the minds of economists.
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:35.900]   In fact, my latest book called "Capitalism, Socialism,
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:40.220]   and the Neoclassical Trap" deals precisely with this issue.
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.860]   - Yeah, you've outlined these ideas in "Capitalism, Socialism,
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:44.700]   and the Neoclassical Trap."
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:47.860]   So the trap is that there's no such thing
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:49.020]   as a middle ground.
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:50.940]   It's either capitalism or socialism,
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:55.340]   and every middle ground ends up in a state of socialism.
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:47:00.340]   - Well, actually that is what Mises said that there were,
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:04.220]   he said that there are only two systems,
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:07.900]   free enterprise capitalism and socialism.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:10.540]   And he also pointed out,
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:14.100]   and this is proven in Hayek's book, "The Road to Serfdom,"
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:16.540]   that any middle ground solution is unstable
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:20.500]   in terms of capitalism, meaning it tends towards socialism.
[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:23.060]   So when you implement an intervention,
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:24.620]   it causes government failure,
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:27.060]   which then triggers further intervention,
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:30.500]   setting up a trap that results in more and more intervention.
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.260]   And in this context, the neoclassicals
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:35.220]   with their market failure theory
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.060]   are in fact dealing with problems
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:39.180]   that are fundamentally mathematical.
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:43.500]   Rather than making the world a better place,
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.460]   they have, if you will, been instrumental
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.980]   in increasing the levels of intervention.
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:49.300]   Let me tell you something.
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:56.740]   Well, you know, I have an economist
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:48:00.380]   as chairman of the President's Advisory Council,
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:06.420]   Dr. Damien Radel, who studied here at Harvard University
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:09.180]   and completed his PhD,
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:13.660]   was mentored by Kenneth Rogoff, the American economist.
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:18.660]   And Rogoff has said that Dr. Radel was his best student.
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:24.300]   Nowadays, we're actually working with Dr. Radel
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:29.300]   specifically on all these issues that arise from,
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:34.380]   you know, the interventions proposed,
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:40.940]   proposed by the mainstream,
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:43.860]   such as the so-called correction of market failures.
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:49.980]   And a few days ago, he conducted a survey
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:54.980]   of search algorithms and policy recommendations,
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:49:01.660]   and that resulted in a map painted from red to blue.
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:07.540]   And, well, the redder it was,
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:10.340]   the more it was linked to socialism.
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:13.260]   There was an intermediate thing that was yellow,
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:16.700]   and blue was free market ideas.
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:19.460]   And one of the things he discovered
[01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:22.700]   as part of that graph or chart
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:26.900]   was that the largest,
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:31.700]   the largest number of policy recommendations
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:36.140]   scandalously are actually left-leaning.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:39.780]   So that is the empirical evidence
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:41.820]   of what I pointed out in the book,
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:45.580]   capitalism, socialism, and the neoclassical trap.
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:49.220]   - You mentioned your four-legged children.
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:52.860]   What have you learned about life from your dogs?
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:56.180]   - Well, from my four-legged children,
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:59.540]   I have learned unconditional love.
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:03.700]   In fact, well,
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:11.100]   my name in Hebrew means loyal friend, faithful friend,
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:14.540]   and on the Chinese horoscope, I am dog.
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:18.980]   And if there's one thing that defines me
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:23.180]   is loyalty being decent.
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:24.700]   And those virtues, you know,
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.940]   you can find them in those wonderful beings
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:32.220]   that dogs are who love unconditionally.
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:36.580]   In fact, they are superior beings, right?
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:40.860]   Spiritually speaking, in my case,
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:45.220]   because, you know,
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:49.100]   I don't forget or forgive those who have harmed me.
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:53.260]   That is to say, all those who have insulted,
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:55.620]   defamed me, and criticized me,
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:58.020]   I remember each one of them,
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:02.460]   but I don't have the greatness needed to forgive them.
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:06.740]   - On the topic of loyalty in politics,
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:08.940]   I'm sure there's been a lot of people,
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:11.260]   some people who have betrayed you.
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:15.860]   Does that hurt your heart?
[01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:18.700]   - It depends.
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:21.740]   Because
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:27.740]   you sometimes think that you can expect
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:31.220]   some people to be loyal, and if they betray you,
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:35.980]   of course, that hurts.
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:38.260]   But some people, you actually don't expect
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:42.500]   anything from them, so if there's betrayal,
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:44.940]   I mean, you won't be annoyed or feel bad
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:49.580]   because you owe it to someone who didn't share your values,
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:53.180]   but politics does have that, you know?
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:59.020]   Sometimes, many of the people you may come across
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:01.620]   don't have the values you advocate for,
[01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:04.900]   but it's cost-benefit.
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:07.660]   You need to let the ship sail on, right?
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:09.300]   Or would you rather let it sink?
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:13.260]   That's not my case, I fight until the end.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:16.900]   There are traitors, but that's part of politics.
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:22.900]   And that's not my line, but of course, they do exist.
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.780]   - There are a lot of people who admire
[01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:28.100]   your revolutionary spirit.
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:31.580]   What advice would you give them, maybe young people,
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:35.620]   on how to live a life like yours
[01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:39.140]   and have an impact on the world like you have begun to do?
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:41.780]   - I didn't do this thinking about
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:43.380]   having an impact on the world.
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:49.780]   I have defined what makes me happy
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:52.340]   and I live according to that.
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:54.180]   I live consistently by that.
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:53:02.780]   And most importantly, I would say never give up.
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:08.940]   Moreover, and above all, never be half-hearted.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:16.540]   I would rather cry because I failed
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:22.860]   rather than not crying because I never tried.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:27.820]   I mean, I'm a perfectionist, so when I do err,
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:31.260]   of course, I have a bad time.
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:36.260]   But still, I prefer to go and get things done.
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:41.180]   If it goes wrong, it's part of life, but I will never.
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:45.380]   Never have to regret not having done
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:49.300]   what I thought needed to be done at that moment, all right?
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:52.940]   - What gives you hope about the future of Argentina
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:54.980]   and the future of humanity?
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:01.380]   - Well, the fact that thanks to social media
[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:04.420]   and to the whole tech revolution going on,
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:09.140]   every day, more and more people are becoming aware
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:16.020]   of how important freedom is to live in peace and prosperity.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:19.940]   To live in peace and prosperity.
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:24.060]   And I believe even though bureaucrats and the elites
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:28.300]   fight untiringly to enslave us,
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:33.620]   a wave of freedom has been unleashed,
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:39.020]   which if we do wage the fight,
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:41.420]   we'll have a much better world.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:46.660]   - What does your famous words of Viva la Libertad,
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:49.580]   how did that come about and what does it mean to you?
[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:51.100]   - Long live freedom, damn it.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:54.580]   You know, that first started
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:59.900]   while I was giving my book presentations,
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:01.420]   at the end of my presentation,
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:04.980]   I would say, "Viva la Libertad, carajo."
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:08.340]   And that really stuck with me since then.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:12.300]   Without thinking about it, throughout my life,
[01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:14.860]   it was going to continue being present.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:17.500]   In fact, today, my presentations,
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:20.780]   all of my speeches end with,
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:24.980]   "May God bless the Argentinians.
[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:27.140]   "May the forces of heaven be with us
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:29.500]   "and viva la Libertad, carajo."
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:33.100]   The first phrase reflects
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:38.780]   my faith in God, fervently.
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:42.940]   And that I'm deeply thankful to the creator
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:46.940]   for the wonderful things he has bestowed upon me daily.
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:50.180]   The second one has to do with a quote
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:54.220]   from the book of Maccabees 3.19,
[01:55:54.220 --> 01:55:55.700]   which says that victory in battle
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:57.860]   doesn't depend on the size of the army,
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:55:59.340]   but on the forces of heaven.
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:04.860]   This has to do with the victory of the Jewish people,
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:07.420]   the Maccabeans against the Greeks,
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:09.420]   and how they recovered the temple.
[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:14.180]   And the last one, well, is my war cry.
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:17.580]   - Well, there's no better way to end it.
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:20.660]   Thank you for being a warrior for freedom.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:21.980]   And thank you for talking today.
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:25.300]   - Thank you very much, indeed, for your interview.
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.100]   And thank you for being so well-educated
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:31.540]   because very often, interviewers are not like that.
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:34.340]   And you did have windows to play foul, and you didn't,
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:37.380]   and I recognize that, and I thank you for that.
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:38.220]   - Thank you.
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:41.060]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.660]   with Javier Millet.

[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:48.460]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:49.500]   from George Orwell.
[01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:52.380]   "In a time of deceit,
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:55.700]   "telling the truth is a revolutionary act."
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:58.380]   Thank you for listening.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:00.380]   I hope to see you next time.
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:05.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:15.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
