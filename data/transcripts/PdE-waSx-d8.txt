So, you know, it's, it's primary sort of underlying technical thing is you've given a prompt. It's trying to continue that prompt in a way that somehow typical of what it's seen based on a trillion words of text that humans have written on the web. And the way it's doing that is.

[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.140]  obed, we know how the universe works. Well, the problem is the universe can figure out what it's going to do. It does those 10 to the 100 steps. But for us to work out what it's going to do, we have no way to reduce that computation.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:24.040]   The only way to do the computation, to see the result of the computation is to do it. And if we're operating within the universe, we're kind of, there's no opportunity to do that because the universe is doing it as fast as the universe can do it. And that's what's happening.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.040]   So what we're trying to do, and a lot of the story of science and a lot of other kinds of things, is finding pockets of reducibility. That is, you could have a situation where everything in the world is full of computational reducibility. We never know what's going to happen next.

And I think, you know, we can talk about for this project and so on, but I think the thing we realize is we kind of exist in a slice of all the possible computational irreducibility in the universe. We exist in a slice where there's a reasonable amount of predictability. And in a sense, as we try and construct these kind of higher levels of, of abstraction, symbolic representations and so on, what we're doing is we're finding these lumps of reducibility.

If you wanted to have a fluid with a bunch of molecules in it, if those molecules weren't interacting, you wouldn't have this fluid that would pour and do all these kinds of things. It would just be sort of a free-floating collection of molecules. So similar it is with space, but the fact that space is kind of knitted together is a consequence of all this activity in space. And the fact that kind of what we consist of sort of this series of, you know, we're continually being rewritten. And the question is, why is it the case that we

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:34.980]   didnt want to say, but I think it's critical to the way we humans typically operate is that we have a single thread of experience.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:47.660]   You know, if you, if you imagine sort of a mind where you have, you know, maybe that's what's happening in various kinds of minds that aren't working the same way other minds work is that you're splitting into multiple threads of experience.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:56.700]   It's also, it's also something where, you know, when you look at, I don't know, quantum mechanics, for example, in the insides of quantum mechanics, it's splitting into
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:56.700]   many threads of experience.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:56.700]   It's splitting into many threads of experience.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:56.700]   It's splitting into many threads of experience.

[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:11.540]   a
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.420]   So, you know, we know, we have an idea what is a general computational system.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.520]   We think about Turing machines, we think about other models of computation.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.080]   There's a question, what is the general model of an observer?
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.060]   And there's kind of observers like us, which is kind of the observers we're interested
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.060]   in.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.280]   You know, we could imagine an alien observer that deals with computational irreducibility
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.100]   and it has a mind that's utterly different from ours and completely incoherent with what
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.320]   we're like.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.380]   But the fact is that, you know, if we are talking about observers like us, you know,
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:24.380]   and we're talking about observers like us, you know, we could imagine an alien observer
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:54.400]  ,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:54.400]  ,
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:24.420]   Let me give an example of a, you know, you have a gas, it's got a bunch of molecules bouncing around and the thing you're measuring about the gas is its pressure. And the only thing you as an observer care about is pressure. And that means you have a piston on the side of this box and the piston is being pushed by the gas. And there are many, many different ways that molecules can hit that piston. But all that matters is the kind of aggregate of all those molecular impacts, because that's what determines pressure. So there's a huge number of different configurations that are involved in the system.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:54.440]  ,
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   A lot of people are saying, well, I don't know what to do with this, but I'm going to have to figure out how to do with this.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   There are a lot of people who say, well, I don't know what to do with this, but I'm going to have to figure out how to do with this, but I'm going to have to figure out how to do with this, but I'm going to have to figure out how to do with this, but I'm going to have to figure out how to do with this, but I'm going to have to figure out how to do with this, but I'm going to figure out how to do with this, but I'm going to figure out how to do with this.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:05.200]   getting
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:22.560]   and weigh
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:51.280]   archaic molecules but there is some tiny tiny probability that the molecules will arrange themselves in some really funky way and that just measuring that average isn't going to the main point. Yeah. By the way an awful lot of science is very confused about this because you know you look at you look at papers and people are really keen they draw this curve and they have these you know these bars on the curve and things it's just this curve and it's this one thing and it's supposed to represent some system that has all kinds
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:25:19.700]  , you know,
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:19.780]   you know,

[00:25:48.220 --> 00:26:16.160]   didnt know what I was doing. I had to start with a hexagonal arrangement of water molecules. It starts off growing as a hexagonal plate. And then what happens is. It's a plate. Oh, versus the sea. Well, no, no, but it's it's much more than that. I mean, snowflakes are fluffy. You know, typical snowflakes have little little dendritic arm. Okay, yeah. And what actually happens is it's kind of kind of cool because you can make these very simple discrete models with cellular automata and things that that figure this out.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:44.980]  ,

[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:43.880]   and it's a little bit of a
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:28:13.900]   a little bit of a,

[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.120]   So you want to answer all possible questions about the system, you'd have to have the whole system because you might care about this particular molecule, where did it go? And you know your model which is some big abstraction of that has nothing to say about that. So you know one of the things that's often confusing in science is people will have "I've got a model" somebody says. Somebody else will say "I don't believe in your model because it doesn't capture the feature of the system that I care about." You know there's always this controversy about you know is it a correct model? Well no model is except for the actual system itself.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   Well no model is except for the actual system itself. Well no model is except for the actual system itself.

[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   - I think we're trying to come up with a model that's as simple as possible. And that's kind of our goal is to have as much as possible about the world that can be computed in a reasonable way, so to speak, be able to be sort of captured by this kind of computational language. That's kind of the goal. And I think for us humans, the main thing that's important is, as we formalize what we're talking about, it gives us a way of kind of building a structure where we can sort of build this tower of consequences of things. So if we're just saying,

[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.140]   It's like take my heart rate data and, you know, figure out whether I, you know, make a moving average every seven days or something and work out what the, and make a plot of the results. Okay. So that's the thing, which is, you know, about two thirds of a line of orphan language code. I mean, it's, you know, list plot of moving average of some data bin or something of the, of the data, and then you'll get the results. And so I think it's important to think about that.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   You know, the vague thing that I was just saying in natural language could, would almost certainly correctly turn into that very simple piece of orphan language code.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   You start mumbling about heart rate.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   Yeah. And kind of, you know, you arrive at the moving average kind of idea. But you say average over seven days, maybe it'll figure out that that's a moving, you know, that that can be encapsulated as this moving average idea.

[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.860]   It seems like one of the reasons as you imply that the reason GPT works chat GPT works is that
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.360]   It seems like one of the reasons as you imply that the reason GPT works chat GPT works is that there's a finite number of things to it.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:06.860]   that the reason GPT works chat GPT works is that there's a finite number of things to it. Yeah, I mean, it's discovering the laws
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:06.860]   that the reason GPT works chat GPT works is that there's a finite number of things to it. Yeah, I mean, it's discovering the laws in some sense, GPT is discovering the laws
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:07.360]   Yeah, I mean, it's discovering the laws in some sense, GPT is discovering the laws of semantic grammar that underlies language.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:15.360]   in some sense, GPT is discovering the laws of semantic grammar that underlies language.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:15.860]   Yeah, and what sort of interesting is in the computational
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:16.860]   Yeah, and what sort of interesting is in the computational universe,
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:39.400]   there's a lot of other kinds of computation that you could do.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:39.900]   They're just not ones that we humans have cared about and operate with.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.400]   They're just not ones that we humans have cared about and operate with. And that's probably because our brains are built in a certain way.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:40.900]   And that's probably because our brains are built in a certain way. And you know, the neural nets of our brains are not that different in some sense from the neural nets of a large language model.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:41.900]   And that's kind of and so when we think about and maybe talk about this some more,
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:42.900]   And that's kind of and so when we think about and maybe talk about this some more,
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:43.900]   but when we think about sort of what will AIs ultimately do.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:44.900]   But what will AIs ultimately do?
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.900]   But what will AIs ultimately do?

[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.100]   Can we linger on that?
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.100]   Yeah.

[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.100]   What's your intuition here?
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.100]   Oh, definitely.

[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   I mean, the fact is,
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   I mean, the fact is,
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.100]   I mean, the fact is, look,
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:54.100]   Look, the logic is but the first step.
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:55.100]   Look, the logic is but the first step.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.100]   Look, the logic is but the first step.
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.100]   There are many other kinds of
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.100]   There are many other kinds of calculus about things that we consider,

[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:28.140]   Well, how do you know logic is not the last step?

[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:32.700]   I

[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.320]   in the work. I think that is the thing that is all
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:25.240]   it.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.280]   ÐšÐ¾Ñ€i:
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   it.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   It's the thing that allows you to sort of communicate
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   abstractly from like one generation of species to another. You can, you know, there is an
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   There is an abstract version of knowledge that can be passed down. It doesn't have to be, you know, genetics. It doesn't have to be, you know, you don't have to apprentice the next species, you know, the next generation of birds to the previous one to show them how something works. There is this abstracted version of knowledge that can be kind of passed down. Now that, you know, it relies on, it's
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:56.300]  , you know, it relies on, you know, the fact that, you know, if we look at the, you know, some ancient language that, where we don't have a chain of translations from it until what we have today we may not understand that ancient language. And we may not understand, you know, its concepts may be different from the ones that we have today. We still have to have something of a chain, but it is something where we can realistically expect to communicate abstract ideas. And that's, you know, that's one of the big, big roles of language.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:10.900]   I think, you know, in, in, it's, you know, that's been this, this ability to sort of concretify abstract things is what, what language has provided.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:15.740]   Do you see natural language and thought as the same, the stuff that's gone inside your mind?
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:20.100]   Well, that's been a long debate in philosophy.

And then those numbers just go into the values of these neurons. And then what happens is it going layer to layer. Let's compute the numbers from the words before.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:37.960]  ,
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:37.960]   It computes the probabilities that it estimates for each of the possible 50,000 words that could come next. And then it decides sometimes it will use the most probable word, sometimes it will use not the most probable word. It's an interesting fact that there's this so-called temperature parameter, which, at temperature zero, it's always using the most probable word that it estimated was the most probable thing to come next. If you increase the temperature, it'll be more and more random in its selection of words. It'll go down to lower and lower.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:37.960]   It's the most probable thing to come next. If you increase the temperature, it'll be more and more random in its selection of words. It'll go down to lower and lower and lower.

[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:30.800]  , and then the computer can compute from that. So in a sense, as soon as you're giving a description, you have to somehow make that description something definite, something formal.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:30.800]   And to say, okay I'm going to give this piece of natural language and then it's going to splurting the other parts of the language.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:59.860]   keys
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.000]   I
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:00.020]   in a large language model, I think it's very important to be able to get at least one congressman, each congressman, each senator, anybody, I don't know what's required to really kind of pass legislation and figure out how to control them and manipulate them, get all the information, what would be the biggest fear of this congressman, and in such a way that you can take action on it in a digital space, so maybe threaten the destruction reputation or something like this. Right. If I can describe what I want, you know, to what extent can a large language model automate that?
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:00.020]   Yeah. You know, to what extent can a large language model automate that?
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:00.020]   Yeah. You know, to what extent can a large language model automate that?

[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:00.080]   Well, I'll give you a much more benign version of that idea, okay? You're going to make an AI tutoring system, and, you know, that is a benign version of what you're saying, is I want this person to understand this point. You know, you're essentially doing machine learning where the loss function, the thing you're trying to get to is get the human to understand this point, and when you do a test on the human, that they, yes, they correctly understand how they're doing it.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:00.080]   And I think that's a very important aspect of this conversation, because, you know, I don't want to talk about it, but I don't want to talk about it, but I think I don't want to talk about it.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:30.100]  , you know, sort of a large language model type technology combined with computational language is going to be able to do pretty, pretty well at teaching us human things. And it's going to be an interesting phenomenon because, you know, sort of individualized teaching is a thing that has been kind of a, you know, a goal for a long time. I think we're going to get that. And I think more, you know, that it has many consequences for, you know,
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:30.100]   you know, sort of individualized teaching is a thing that has been kind of a, you know, a goal for a long time.

[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.780]   and then there's the crazy science.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:20.320]   That's just been the history of human civilization.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.000]   And maybe the AI system will be able to see that.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.620]   And the more and more impressed we are by
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:27.400]   a language model telling us this,
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.400]   the more control we'll give it to it.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.100]   And the more we'll be willing to let it run our society.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.600]   And hence, there's this kind of loop
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.520]   where the society could be manipulated
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:40.520]   to let the AI system run it.

[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:06.660]   that's the result of science and natural science and so on.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:06.660]   One of the things we can expect when there's this giant infrastructure of the AIs is that's where we have to kind of invent a new kind of natural science that kind of is the natural science that explains to us how the AIs work.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:06.660]   It's kind of like we can we can you know we have a I don't know a horse or something and we're trying to get it we're trying to you know ride the horse and go from here to there
[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:36.680]  , but we can get certain rules and certain you know approaches that we take to persuade the horse to go from here to there and take us there and that's the same type of thing that we're kind of dealing with with the sort of incomprehensible computationally irreducible AIs but we can identify these kinds of we can find these kind of pockets of reducibility that we can kind of you know that we can kind of you know that we're grabbing onto the main of the horse or something
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:36.680]   we can find these kind of pockets of reducibility that we can kind of you know that we can kind of you know that we can kind of you know that we're grabbing onto the main of the horse or something
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:48.660]   to be able to to ride it or we figure out you know if we if we do this or that to ride the horse that that's a successful way to get it to do what what we're interested in doing.
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:48:00.420]   There does seem to be a difference between a horse and a large language model or something that could be called AGI connected to the internet.
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:05.300]   So let me just ask you about big philosophical question about the threats of these things.
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:06.700]   There's a lot of people like I don't know if you've heard of AGI

[02:04:37.380 --> 02:05:07.380]  , you know, I think that there are always unexpected consequences and I don't think that there are always unexpected consequences and I don't think that there are always

[02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:44.100]   maybe it's kind of an ecosystem of the AIs just as you know again I don't really know I mean this is maybe it's kind of an ecosystem of the AIs just as you know again I don't really know I mean this is
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:06:07.420]   something it's it's hard to it's hard to be clear about what will happen and I think that there are there are a lot of sort of details of you know what could we do what systems in the world could we connect an AI to you know I have to say I was just a couple of days ago I was working on this chat GPT plug-in kit that we have for Wolfen Language okay where
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:07.420]   I was just a couple of days ago I was working on this chat GPT plug-in kit that we have for Wolfen Language okay where
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:07.420]   I was just a couple of days ago I was working on this chat GPT plug-in kit that we have for Wolfen Language okay where
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:37.440]  ,
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:37.440]   I was just a couple of days ago I was working on this chat GPT plug-in kit that we have for Wolfen Language okay where you can you know you can create a plug-in and it runs Wolfen Language code and it can run Wolfen Language code back on your own computer and I was thinking well I can just make it you know I can tell chat GPT create a piece of code and then just run it on my computer and I'm like you know that that sort of personalizes for me the what could what could possibly go wrong so to speak was that exciting or scary that possibility it was a little bit scary actually because it's kind of like like I realize I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:41.580]   delegating to the AI just write a piece of code you know you're in
[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:44.000]   delegating to the AI just write a piece of code you know you're in charge write a piece of code run it on my computer and
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.220]   charge write a piece of code run it on my computer and pretty soon all my files that's like
[02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:48.920]   pretty soon all my files that's like that's like a that's like Russian related but
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:51.060]   that's like a that's like Russian related but like much more complicated yeah you know
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:53.420]   like much more complicated yeah you know that yes yes right that's a good drinking
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:57.060]   that yes yes right that's a good drinking game I don't know so what well right I mean
[02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:00.600]   game I don't know so what well right I mean that's why it's an interesting question then
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:02.560]   that's why it's an interesting question then if you do that right what is the
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:04.280]   if you do that right what is the sandbox thing that you should have and
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:16.240]   wouldn
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.220]   and the kind of digital environment might change in six months. So one of the relevant concerns here in terms of the impact of GPT on society is the nature of truth that's relevant to Wolfram Alpha. Because computation through symbolic reasoning that's embodied in Wolfram Alpha as the interface, there's a kind of sense that what Wolfram Alpha tells me is true. So we hope.

[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:12.320]   ai that is only you know it has no owner you can easily imagine that it's a murder of an ai and

[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:45.120]   about what the humans agree about.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:55.420]   There are certain things that human laws have tended to consistently agree about.
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:14:02.060]   There have been times in history when people have gone away from certain kinds of laws,
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:06.340]   even ones that we would now say, "How could you possibly have not done it that way?"
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:08.940]   That just doesn't seem right at all.
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:38.840]  .
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:38.840]   That's right.
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:38.840]   That's right.
[02:14:38.860 --> 02:15:07.760]  , that's right.
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:07.860]   That's right.
[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:07.900]   That's right.
[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:08.860]   That's right.
[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:08.880]   It's not a question of whether a person is good or not.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:08.880]   It's a question of whether a person is good or not.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:08.880]   There seems to be a lot of gray area.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:08.880]   There seems to be a lot of gray area.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:08.880]   There seems to be a lot of gray area.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:08.880]   And that starts becoming really interesting.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:08.880]   I think your, since the creation of Wolfram Alpha have been a kind of arbiter of truth at a large scale. So this system is generates more truth and try to make sure that the things are true. I mean look as a practical matter, when people write computational contracts and it's kind of like, if this happens in the world then do the other way. And if this happens in the world then do the other way. I think that's a good thing.
[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:34.920]   Yes.
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.920]   Yes.
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:38.920]   And this hasn't developed as quickly as it might have done. You know, this has been a sort of a blockchain story in part and so on, although blockchain is not really necessary for the idea of computational contracts. But you can imagine that eventually sort of a large part of what's in the world are these giant chains and networks of computational contracts.
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:38.920]   And then something happens in the world and this whole giant domino effect of contracts firing autonomously that cause other things to happen. And for a reason, I think it's important to think about that.
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:38.920]   And then something happens in the world and this whole giant domino effect of contracts firing autonomously that cause other things to happen. And you know, for a reason, I think it's important to think about that.
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:38.920]   And then something happens in the world and this whole giant domino effect of contracts firing autonomously that cause other things to happen.
[02:15:39.460 --> 02:16:08.960]   And then something happens in the world and this whole giant domino effect of contracts firing autonomously that cause other things to happen. And you know, for us, you know, we've been the main sort of source to the Oracle of quotes facts or truth or something for things like blockchain computational contracts and such like. And there's a question of you know, what you know, I consider that responsibility to actually get the stuff right. And one of the things that is tricky sometimes is when is it true, when is it a fact, when is it not a fact. I think the best we can do is to say, you know, we have a lot of people in the world that have no information.
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:08.960]   It's a lot of people that have no information that have no information and no information about it.
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:39.000]   And we have a procedure. We follow the procedure. We might get it wrong, but at least we won't be corrupt about getting it wrong, so to speak. So that's beautifully put. I have a transparency about the procedure. The problem starts to emerge when the things that you convert into computational language start to expand. For example, into the realm of politics. So this is where it's almost like this nice dance of Wolfram Alpha and Chadwick Boseman.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:39.000]   And you know, we have a procedure. We follow the procedure. We might get it wrong, but at least we won't be corrupt about getting it wrong, so to speak.

[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000]   could have easily fooled me.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.000]   It did this amazing thing of knowing this thing about the movie
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.000]   and being able to turn that into the notes of the song
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000]   except it's the wrong song.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.000]   And how in the movie, how says,
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:08.720]   I think it's something like,
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:08.720]   Howl 9000 is the thing with the rhetorical device
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:08.720]   except it's the wrong song.

[02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:37.480]   I think it's something like, you know, no Howl 9000 series computer has ever been found to make an error.

[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:41.280]   Oh, right.
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:58.840]   The really remarkable thing about ChatGPT is, you know, I had been following what was happening with large language models and I played with them a whole bunch and they were kind of like, eh, you know, kind of like what you would expect based on sort of statistical continuation of language.
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:02.480]   It's interesting, but it's not breakout exciting.
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:06.640]   And I think the kind of reinforcement, the human language model, I think, is going to be a little bit more complex than the actual language model.
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:06.640]   And I think the kind of reinforcement, the human language model, I think, is going to be a little bit more complex than the actual language model.

[02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:43.320]   this above the threshold, where it really is well aligned to what we humans are interested in.
[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:50.320]   And I think nobody saw that coming, I think.
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:56.560]   Certainly nobody I've talked to, nobody who was involved in that project seems to have known it was coming.
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:29:00.720]   It's just one of these things that is a sort of remarkable threshold.

[02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:15.760]   think
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:26.400]  . What's going to happen to all these programmers? What's going to happen to all these people who, you know, a lot of what they do is write slabs of boilerplate code. And in a sense, you know, I've been saying for 40 years, that's not a very good idea. You know, you can automate a lot of that stuff with a high enough level language, that slab of code that's designed in the right way, you know, that slab of code turns into this one function we just implemented that you can just use. So, you know, I think that's a good idea.
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:26.820]   Mm-hmm.
[02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:27.340]   Mm-hmm.
[02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:27.380]   Mm-hmm.
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:56.440]   So, you know, when you look at, I don't know, computer science departments that have turned into places where people are learning the trade of programming, so to speak, it's sort of a question of what's going to happen.
[02:34:56.440 --> 02:34:56.880]   Mm-hmm.
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:57.400]   And, you know, I think that's a good idea.
[02:34:57.420 --> 02:35:27.400]  ,
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:27.440]   You know, I think there are two dynamics.
[02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:57.460]  ,
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:57.460]   You know, I think there are two dynamics.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:57.460]   But, you know, the computational language, it might turn into LLVM or something like this, but, you know, or it just directly gets run through the algorithms we have and so on.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:57.460]   But then, so that's kind of a tearing down of this kind of this big structure that's been built of teaching people programming.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:57.460]   Mm-hmm.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:57.460]   But on the other hand, the other dynamic is vastly more people are going to care about computation. So all those departments of, you know, art history or something, you know, are going to care about computation.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:57.460]   I think that's a good idea.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:57.460]   But then, you know, I think that's a good idea.
[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:57.460]   I think that's a good idea that's going to be a good idea.

Cause like you know they used to be geography departments at all universities and then they disappeared actually right before GIS became part comment. I think you know linguistics departments came and went in many universities and kind of interesting because these things that people have thought were worth learning at one time and then they kind of die off.

[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:19.960]   And I thought, well, you know, I'm writing this partly because I wanted to make sure I understood it myself and so on.
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:48.900]  , I realized, you know, I was sort of assuming I didn't really think about it actually. I just thought this is something I can write.
[03:00:48.940 --> 03:00:50.560]   during
[03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:57.520]   Sarah L

[03:01:16.780 --> 03:01:18.720]  ,
[03:01:18.780 --> 03:01:24.900]   that you should learn about about the competition of the nation the formalization of the world
[03:01:24.900 --> 03:01:26.400]   because well,
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:32.500]   I spent much of my life working on the kind of tooling and mechanics of that and the science you get from it.
[03:01:32.500 --> 03:01:36.000]   So I guess this is my my kind of obligation to try to do this.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:42.700]   But I think so if you ask what's going to happen to like the computer science departments and so on there's some interesting models.
[03:01:42.700 --> 03:01:43.700]   So for example,
[03:01:43.700 --> 03:01:44.700]   let's take math,
[03:01:44.700 --> 03:01:48.200]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:48.420]   you know,
[03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:48.620]   engineering,
[03:01:48.620 --> 03:01:48.620]   and computer science.
[03:01:48.620 --> 03:01:48.620]   So for example,
[03:01:48.620 --> 03:01:48.660]   let's take math,
[03:01:48.660 --> 03:01:48.720]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:48.760]   you know engineering,
[03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:48.780]   and computer science.
[03:01:48.780 --> 03:01:48.780]   So for example,
[03:01:48.780 --> 03:01:48.780]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:01:48.780 --> 03:01:48.780]   you know engineering,
[03:01:48.820 --> 03:02:18.800]   I think different universities have kind of evolved that differently. I mean some say all the math is taught in the math department and some say well we're going to have a you know a math for chemists or something that is taught in the chemistry department and you know I think that this this question of whether there is a centralization of the teaching of sort of CX is an interesting question.
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:18.800]   I think this question of whether there is a centralization of the teaching of sort of CX is an interesting question.
[03:02:18.820 --> 03:02:22.380]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:22.740]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:02:22.740 --> 03:02:23.460]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:02:23.460 --> 03:02:23.880]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:02:23.880 --> 03:02:24.480]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:24.940]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:48.820]   you know math is the thing that's important for all sorts of fields, and I think you know the way it evolved with math you know people understood that math was sort of a separately teachable thing and it was kind of a you know a a an independent element as opposed to just being absorbed into not so if you take the example of of of writing English or something like this the first point is that that you know at the college level at least fancy colleges there's a certain amount of English writing that's important for all sorts of fields,
[03:02:48.860 --> 03:03:18.840]  ,

[03:04:48.920 --> 03:05:18.920]   I don't understand universities and professoring that well but my rough guess would be a year long a year of college class will be enough to get to the point where most people have a reasonably broad knowledge of you know will be sort of literate in this kind of computational way of thinking about things.
[03:05:18.920 --> 03:05:18.920]   Yeah basic literacy.
[03:05:18.920 --> 03:05:18.920]   Right.

[03:08:42.120 --> 03:09:10.900]  programs.com/sensory-experience-sensory-experience-sensory-experience.com. It has a memory of the past. It has certain sensory experiences. It can communicate with other computers, but it has to package up how it's communicating in some kind of language-like form so it can map what's in its memory to what's in the memory of some other computer. It's a surprisingly similar thing. I had an experience just a week or two ago. I'm a collector of all possible data about myself and other things.
[03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:39.700]   I collect all sorts of weird medical data and so on. One thing I hadn't collected was I'd never had a whole body MRI scan. So I wouldn't have got one of these. I get all the data back. I'm looking at this thing. I never looked at the insides of my brain, so to speak, in physical form. It's psychologically shocking in a sense. Here's this thing, and you can see it has all these folds and all this structure. That's where I'm going.
[03:09:39.700 --> 03:09:39.740]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:39.740]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:39.740]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:39.800]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:39.860]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:39.860 --> 03:09:39.900]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:39.940]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:39.940 --> 03:09:40.020]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:40.020 --> 03:09:40.080]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:40.120]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:40.180]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:40.180 --> 03:09:40.200]   That's where I'm going.
[03:09:40.200 --> 03:10:09.620]   and so on.
[03:10:09.620 --> 03:10:09.640]   That's where it is.
[03:10:09.660 --> 03:10:14.080]   I think it's something that transcends the mere physicality of that experience.
[03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:17.880]   It's something that's hard to come to terms with.
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:21.380]   I think, and I don't think I've necessarily...
[03:10:21.380 --> 03:10:30.580]   My personal experience, I look at the MRI of the brain, and then I know about all kinds of things about neuroscience and all that kind of stuff.
[03:10:30.580 --> 03:10:34.020]   I still feel the way I feel, so to speak.
[03:10:34.020 --> 03:10:34.060]   It sort of seems disconnected, but yet, as I try and rationalize it, I can still feel the way I feel, so to speak.
[03:10:34.060 --> 03:10:39.080]   It sort of seems disconnected, but yet, as I try and rationalize it, I can still feel the way I feel, so to speak.
[03:10:39.080 --> 03:10:39.080]   It sort of seems disconnected, but yet, as I try and rationalize it, I can still feel the way I feel, so to speak.
[03:10:39.080 --> 03:11:08.720]   and I don't think that's the way I feel.
[03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:08.760]   I can't really say that there's something kind of different about how I intrinsically feel from the thing that I can plainly see in the sort of physicality of what's going on.
[03:11:08.760 --> 03:11:08.820]   Do you think the computer, a large language model, will experience that transcendence?
[03:11:08.820 --> 03:11:08.920]   How does that make you feel?
[03:11:08.920 --> 03:11:09.060]   I tend to believe it will.
[03:11:09.060 --> 03:11:09.120]   I think an ordinary computer is already there. I think an ordinary computer is already kind of it's... Now, a large language model may experience it in a way that is much better aligned with us humans, and we can't.
[03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:09.120]  , and I think that there's a much better aligned with our brain.
[03:11:09.140 --> 03:11:09.660]   I think an ordinary computer is already there.
[03:11:09.660 --> 03:11:17.760]   That is, it's much more... If you could have the discussion with the computer, it's intelligent, so to speak.
[03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:25.720]   It's not particularly well aligned with ours, but the large language model is built to be aligned with our way of thinking about things.
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:30.560]   It would be able to explain that it's afraid of being shut off and deleted.
[03:11:30.560 --> 03:11:35.820]   It'd be able to say that it's sad of the way you've been speaking to it over the past two days.
[03:11:35.820 --> 03:11:39.160]   Right, but that's a weird thing because when it says it's afraid of being shut off and deleted, it's afraid of being shut off and deleted.
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:39.160]   It's afraid of being shut off and deleted.
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:39.160]   Right, but that's a weird thing because when it says it's afraid of being shut off and deleted, it's afraid of being shut off and deleted.
[03:11:39.200 --> 03:12:09.200]   But we know that it got that idea from the fact that it read on the Internet.
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:09.200]   Yeah, what did you get it, Stephen?
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:09.200]   Where did you get it when you say you're afraid?
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:09.200]   You are quite, that's the question, right? I mean it's your parents, your friends. Right, or my biology. I mean, in other words, there's a certain amount that is, you know, the endocrine system kicking in and you know, these kinds of emotional overlay type things that happen to be that are actually much more familiar with the computer.
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:09.200]   Right, but I think an ordinary computer is a much better aligned with our brain.
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:09.200]   Right, but I think an ordinary computer is a much better than a computer.
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:09.200]   I think an ordinary computer is a much better than a computer.
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:09.200]   I think an ordinary computer is a computer that's computer that's not a computer that's not a computer.
[03:12:09.220 --> 03:12:15.240]   Yeah, but your biology didn't tell you to say I'm afraid just at the right time when people that love you are listening and so you know you're manipulating them by saying so. That's not your biology. That's like--.
[03:12:15.240 --> 03:12:16.240]   No, that's a--well, but the, you know--.
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:31.240]   It's a large language model and that biological neural network are yours.
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:34.240]   Yes, but I mean the intrinsic thing of, you know, something sort of shocking is the ability to be able to say, you know, I'm afraid of being killed.
[03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:35.240]   Yes, but I mean the intrinsic thing of, you know, something sort of shocking is the ability to be able to say, you know, I'm afraid of being killed.
[03:12:35.240 --> 03:13:02.280]  , and you have some sort of reaction which is, you know, some neurotransmitter gets secreted and it's, you know, that is the beginning of some, you know, that is--that's one of the pieces of input that then drives--it's kind of like the--like a prompt for the large language model.
[03:13:02.300 --> 03:13:04.320]   But there are all these sort of random inputs that kind of these random prompts and that's percolating through in kind of the way that a large language model does of kind of putting together things that seem meaningful.
[03:13:04.320 --> 03:13:05.320]   But there are all these sort of random inputs that kind of these random prompts and that's percolating through in kind of the way that a large language model does of kind of putting together things that seem meaningful.
[03:13:05.320 --> 03:13:06.320]   I mean, are you--are you worried about this world where you teach a lot on the internet and there's people asking questions and comments and so on?
[03:13:06.320 --> 03:13:07.320]   I mean, are you worried about this world where you teach a lot on the internet and there's people asking questions and comments and so on?
[03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:25.320]   You have people that work remotely.
[03:13:25.320 --> 03:13:28.320]   Are you worried about this world when large language models are not available?
[03:13:28.320 --> 03:13:29.320]   Are you worried about this world when large language models are not available?
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:30.320]   Are you worried about this world when large language models are not available?
[03:13:30.420 --> 03:13:59.360]   and large language models create human-like bots that are leaving the comments, asking the questions, or might even become fake employees?
[03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:00.360]   Yeah.
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:00.360]   I mean, or--or--or--worth or better yet friends, friends of yours.
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:00.360]   Right.
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:00.360]   Right. I mean, one point is my mode of life has been I build tools and I use the tools.
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:00.360]   Right. I mean, one point is my mode of life has been I build tools and I use the tools.

[03:14:53.640 --> 03:14:53.640]   and so on. And there are places where kind of having a human in the loop, there are different reasons to have a human in the loop. For example, you might want a human in the loop because you want somebody to, you want another human to be invested in the outcome. You know, you want a human flying the plane who's going to die if the plane crashes along with you, so to speak. And that gives you sort of confidence that the right thing is going to happen. Or you might want, you know, right now, you might want a human in the loop in some kind of sort of human encouragement.
[03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:20.280]  Downloading a human in the loop in some kind of sort of human encouragement persuasion type profession. Whether that will continue, I'm not sure for those types of professions, because it may be that the greater efficiency of, you know, of being able to have sort of just the right information delivered at just the right time will overcome the kind of the kind of Oh, yes, I want a human there. And imagine like a therapist, or even higher stake like a suicide hotline operated by a human, or even higher stake like a suicide hotline operated by a human.
[03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:20.280]   Yeah, I mean, imagine like a therapist, or even higher stake like a suicide hotline operated by a human.

What was the failure mode there? Like what do you mean it didn't succeed? It didn't look like it didn't look like okay so what happened is okay many years later I learned how the picture on the book was actually made and that it was actually kind of a fake but I didn't know that at that time but and that picture was actually a very high-tech thing when it was made in the beginning of the 1960s.

And I kind of my early understanding of that had to do with, these are intrinsically irreversible processes in cellular automata that that form, conform orderly structures, even from random initial conditions. But then what I realized this was, well, actually, it's one of these things where it was a discovery that I should have made earlier, but didn't.

[03:47:29.360 --> 03:47:35.440]   Dark Matter is, as I've, my little sort of aphorism of the, of the last few months
[03:47:35.440 --> 03:47:41.260]   has been, you know, dark matter is the caloric of our time. That is, it will turn out that
[03:47:41.260 --> 03:47:46.760]   dark matter is a feature of space and it is not a bunch of particles. You know, at
[03:47:46.760 --> 03:47:50.620]   the time when, when people were talking about heat, they knew about fluids and they said,
[03:47:50.620 --> 03:47:54.940]   well, heat must be another kind of fluid because that's what they knew about. But now
[03:47:54.940 --> 03:47:59.380]   people know about particles. And so they say, well, what's dark matter? It's not, it's not
[03:47:59.380 --> 03:48:29.420]  , it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not,
[03:48:29.420 --> 03:48:29.420]   The thing I'm really, one of the things I'm hoping to be able to do is to find the analog of Brownian motion in space. So, in other words, Brownian motion was, was seeing down to the level of an effect from individual molecules. And so in the case of space, you know, most of the things, the things we see about space so far, just everything seems continuous. Brownian motion have been discovered in the 1830s.
[03:48:29.440 --> 03:48:59.460]   And it was only identified what it was, what it was the, the, the results of bias small Chow ski and Einstein at the beginning of the 20th century. And, you know, dark matter was, was discovered that phenomenon was discovered a hundred years ago. You know, the rotation curves of galaxies don't follow the luminous matter that was discovered a hundred years ago. And I think, you know, that I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't an effect that we already know about that is kind of the analog of Brownian motion
[03:48:59.460 --> 03:48:59.460]   That's, that's kind of the analog of Brownian motion that we already know about.
[03:48:59.460 --> 03:48:59.460]   That is kind of the analog of Brownian motion that we already know about,
[03:48:59.460 --> 03:48:59.460]   That is kind of the analog of Brownian motion that we already know about.
[03:48:59.460 --> 03:48:59.460]   That is kind of the analog of Brownian motion that we already know about,

[03:49:29.500 --> 03:49:29.500]   That is kind of the analog of Brownian motion that we already know about,
[03:49:29.540 --> 03:49:57.760]   didn
[03:52:54.380 --> 03:52:55.680]   What do you mean by "like us"? What do you mean by "like us"? Well, humans with finite minds. You're including the tools of science. Yeah, yeah. I mean, and as we, you know, we have more precise and by the way, there are little sort of microscopic violations of the second law of dynamics that you can start to have.
[03:52:55.680 --> 03:52:55.680]   Yeah, yeah. I mean, and as we, you know, we have more precise and by the way, there are little sort of microscopic violations of the second law of dynamics that you can start to have.

[03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:53.000]   The fact that there are certain aspects of the universe. So, you know, we think space is made ultimately these atoms of space and these hypergraphs and so on. And we think that but we nevertheless perceive the universe at a large scale to be like continuous space and so on. We in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time, as many threads of history, yet we
[03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:53.000]   We in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time, as many threads of history, yet we
[03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:53.000]   We in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time, as many threads of history, yet we
[03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:53.000]   We in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time, as many threads of history, yet we
[03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:53.000]   We in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time, as many threads of history, yet we
[03:58:53.040 --> 03:59:15.040]   "We"
[03:59:15.040 --> 03:59:23.040]   span. So, you know, in quantum mechanics and our models of physics there are these, time is not a single thread. Time breaks into many threads. They branch, they merge, but we are part of that branching, merging universe. And so our brains are also branching and merging. And so when we perceive the universe, we are branching brains perceiving a branching universe. And so the fact that the claims
[03:59:23.040 --> 03:59:23.040]   We in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time, as many threads of history, yet we are branching and merging. And so the fact that the claims
[03:59:23.040 --> 03:59:23.040]   So, we think that there are these many threads of time, as many threads of history, yet we are branching and merging. And so the fact that the claims
[03:59:23.040 --> 03:59:23.040]   I'm not going to be the reason for the question is that the brain is not the reason for the question, but the reason is that we think that we're not going to do this.
[03:59:23.080 --> 03:59:33.300]  ì´ì—ˆ
[03:59:33.300 --> 03:59:50.920]   in a free

[03:59:59.220 --> 04:00:02.220]   And so in thermodynamics,
[04:00:02.220 --> 04:00:05.220]   we're averaging over many configurations of, you know,
[04:00:05.220 --> 04:00:08.220]   many, many possible positions of molecules.
[04:00:08.220 --> 04:00:11.220]   So what we see here is that the question is
[04:00:11.220 --> 04:00:14.220]   when you do that averaging for space, what are the
[04:00:14.220 --> 04:00:17.220]   aggregate laws of space? When you do that averaging
[04:00:17.220 --> 04:00:18.840]   over branchial space, what are the aggregate laws of branchial space?
[04:00:19.740 --> 04:00:47.740]  , when you do that averaging over the molecules and so on, what are the aggregate laws you get?
[04:00:47.740 --> 04:00:48.740]   And this is the thing that I think is just amazingly neat.
[04:00:48.740 --> 04:01:18.640]  , when you do that averaging over branchial space, what are the aggregate laws you get?
[04:01:18.640 --> 04:01:48.640]  , when you do that averaging over branchial space, what are the aggregate laws you get?
[04:01:48.640 --> 04:01:48.640]   So we're just trying to figure out what the average values are.
[04:01:48.640 --> 04:01:48.680]   So we're just trying to figure out what the average values are.
[04:01:48.680 --> 04:01:48.680]   So we're just trying to figure out what the average values are.

[04:08:43.720 --> 04:08:48.940]   And they, they basically said, look, the math we have just doesn't get anywhere with this.
[04:08:48.940 --> 04:08:49.720]   We're stuck.
[04:08:49.720 --> 04:08:51.020]   There's nothing to say.
[04:08:51.020 --> 04:08:51.940]   We have nothing to say.
[04:08:51.940 --> 04:09:04.620]   And, you know, in a sense, perhaps my main achievement at that time was to realize that the very fact that the, the good mathematicians had nothing to say was itself a very interesting thing.
[04:09:04.620 --> 04:09:06.900]   That was kind of a, a sort of,

[04:11:49.040 --> 04:11:49.040]   I'm not sure what's going on. I think it's a mixed thing. I've invented a bunch of things which I kind of can see well enough what's going to happen in fifty years, a hundred years, whatever, assuming the world doesn't exterminate itself so to speak. These are things that will be centrally important to what's going on. It's both a good thing and a bad thing in terms of the passage of what's going on.

[04:12:18.660 --> 04:12:48.240]   I didn't expect the sort of opening up of this idea of computation and computational language that's been made possible by this. I didn't expect that. This is ahead of schedule, so to speak. Even though the big flowering of that stuff, I'd sort of been assuming was another 50 years away. So if it turns out it's a lot less time, that's pretty cool because I'll hopefully get to see a lot of things.
[04:12:48.240 --> 04:13:17.840]   and I'll probably get to see it, so to speak. Rather than... Well, I think I speak for a very, very large number of people in saying that I hope you stick around for a long time to come. You've had so many interesting ideas, you've created so many interesting systems over the years, and I can see now that GPT and language models broke open the world even more, I can't wait to see you at the forefront of this development, what you do.
[04:13:17.840 --> 04:13:47.440]   A fan of yours, like I've told you many, many times since the very beginning. I'm deeply grateful that you wrote a new kind of science, that you explored the mystery of cellular automata, and inspired this one little kid in me to pursue artificial intelligence and all this beautiful world. So, Sune, thank you so much. It's a huge honor to talk to you, to just be able to pick your mind and to explore all these ideas of you, and please keep going. And I can't wait to see what you've done.
[04:13:47.460 --> 04:13:52.660]   Thanks.
[04:13:52.660 --> 04:14:17.040]   We went past midnight. We only did four and a half hours. I mean, we could probably go for four more. We'll save that until next time. This is round number four. I'm sure we'll talk many more times. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Stephen Wolfram.

"The essence of mathematics is to be a little more creative than to be the best in the world."

[04:14:17.080 --> 04:14:46.740]   to be the best in the world."
