[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   I could never really have an Android as much as I tried a few times, honestly,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.360]   because of that iMessage integration is probably the most important, but also
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.680]   now that I've just gotten so tied into it and then watching all these PCs crash
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.560]   during this CrowdStrike rollout, haven't had any issues on a Mac, love my Macs,
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.680]   love my iPhone, probably won't change that in the future.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.240]   I really love AirPods.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.240]   I actually lost my third gen AirPods and I'm still happy
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.560]   enough with the second gen ones.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.760]   So I've just kept them.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.920]   I did try the Pro AirPods and the AirPod Max's didn't like those, returned them.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.320]   On the computer side, I use an M2 MacBook Air, really love it.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.640]   Got a great sticker on here.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.680]   My other vehicle is a 401k.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.680]   Love that.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.480]   Then let's see, I use a magic keyboard and a magic track pad.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.040]   I don't use an actual mouse.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.880]   I really want the new magic keyboard that has the built-in touch ID,
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.320]   but I don't have that right now.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.000]   I kind of wish I did, but it's one of those things that doesn't feel absolutely necessary.
