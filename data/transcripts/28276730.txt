[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Welcome, friends, to this episode
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.080]   of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.760]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.980]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.060]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.880]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.200]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.340]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.440]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.120]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.360]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.340]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.080]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.080]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.120]   Well, listeners, I have a treat for you today.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.440]   We spend a lot of time talking with homeschooling,
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.180]   mostly moms, but occasionally a dad.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.180]   Today, I want to give you a perspective
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.080]   on homeschooling and beyond,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.640]   but from a dad's perspective.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.640]   I have with me today a dad of two adult daughters.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.720]   He and his wife graduated their children
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.860]   through the Challenge 4 program of Classical Conversations.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.720]   This dad is an educator at heart.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   He loves to learn alongside his children,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.960]   and how do I know all this?
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.100]   Because he's my husband.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.360]   Yes, I have recruited my own husband as a podcast guest
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.020]   because I think he has something unique to say
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.300]   to families, to parents, to homeschoolers,
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.060]   to lifelong learners, to everyday educators.
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.920]   And so I want to welcome to the podcast, my husband, David.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.280]   - Hello.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.420]   - I'm glad for you to get a front row seat
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.960]   for what I spend so much of my week doing every week.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.800]   - I was getting ready to say,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.840]   I bet you say that about all your guests,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.100]   but then you got to the husband part,
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.740]   so you knew I was unique.
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.960]   - I only say that to you.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.040]   Okay, so we want today to give moms and dads,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.080]   grandmas and grandpas, maybe two,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.400]   who are in the trenches of homeschooling their children
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.940]   an idea of what it might look like
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.440]   on the other side of the daily grind.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.440]   When the empty nest becomes reality and not theory,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.060]   we want to give parents an idea of what you've been doing
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.660]   all these years as a homeschooling dad,
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.660]   part of a homeschooling family, the good, the bad, the ugly,
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.120]   and what it looks like now on this side,
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.960]   your hopes, your dreams, what you wish you had done,
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.440]   and how the life of a classical educator
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.100]   has prepared you to enjoy the future with your girls, okay?
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.720]   - Sounds good.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   - So, let me ask you, David, how long did you homeschool?
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.180]   This is not a trick question.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.180]   - We began homeschooling in, I guess,
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.700]   about 1997, something like that.
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.020]   - See, this is why I said,
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.140]   I should have said it is a trick question.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.440]   Some people think, you know,
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.260]   I don't really remember when we started homeschooling.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.980]   We've always just kind of been living this life
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.420]   of the mind with curious children
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.020]   and answering their questions,
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.420]   and so sometimes I tell people we've been homeschooling
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.860]   from the very beginning,
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.060]   from the day we brought our older daughter
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.620]   home from the hospital, and then sometimes I say,
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.460]   I guess we officially started
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.460]   when she would have been a kindergartner, and so, yeah.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.540]   - About 1997, then our younger daughter graduated in 2015,
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.540]   so that's 18 years, is that the math correctly?
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.560]   - It's a long time.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.520]   - So, you've probably told this story before,
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   but when we were deciding how to educate our daughter,
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.860]   well, our daughters, I was all in favor of public school
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.680]   just because it would help us network
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.640]   with a lot of other families, and as a pastor,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.940]   I wanted to have ways to connect with other young families,
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.940]   but you persuaded me to give homeschooling a shot,
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.640]   but one of the key moments came
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.520]   when we had a family visiting with us,
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.020]   and she and her husband homeschooled their children,
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.580]   and they asked us what we were gonna do
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.580]   with our kids' education, and when she said to you
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.400]   that you're already homeschooling now,
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.860]   you're already doing that, and I guess for you and me,
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.440]   it pretty much came naturally,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.020]   and we didn't have to put on a teacher's hat,
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.440]   that's just kind of how we live life.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.380]   - Yeah.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.060]   - And so, yeah, we've been homeschooling,
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.880]   we did it for a number of years.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.280]   - So that's the how long,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.820]   and that's pretty much the way I remember it too,
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.460]   so that's good, but why?
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.460]   Why did you agree to step out onto the path
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.120]   of this homeschooling journey?
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.100]   - That's a good question, because back in the '90s,
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.100]   this was not mainstream in any context,
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.260]   and so it was a more radical kind of endeavor,
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.260]   we didn't have, actually that was the year
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.020]   that CC began in 1997, we didn't know about it then,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.440]   but I think that we wanted to homeschool,
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.900]   I've heard you say this, and I agree,
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.940]   that it's just so fun to see children learn things,
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.180]   we just love children anyway,
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.780]   but we love watching their eyes light up,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.780]   and we love fielding the questions that come to mind.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.520]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, do you think it's safe to say
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.520]   that you were willing to begin the homeschool journey,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.140]   because I really wanted to, and we had people we trusted
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.100]   who thought we could really do this,
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.900]   but you also thought, how badly can we mess them up
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.300]   in kindergarten? (laughing)
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.700]   - I probably wasn't thinking about it that deeply,
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.340]   in terms of long-term, once we started,
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.820]   it seemed so natural to me,
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.040]   I kind of never really looked back.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.940]   - That was what I was gonna ask you next,
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.740]   if that's why you began, just because it is fun
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.660]   to see the light bulbs come on,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.260]   and learning alongside your kids is supernatural,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.260]   and a lot of fun, why did you agree to continue for so long?
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.740]   After we started, do you remember thinking,
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.700]   oh, I'm gonna do this 'til they graduate,
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.260]   or not? - I was not thinking
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.540]   that far ahead. - Yeah.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:50.380]   - You bore the brunt of the whole process,
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   and it's not like it was a lot of work for me to be involved.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.620]   I know that you did a lot of research
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.440]   studying educational curriculum, curricula,
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.220]   and ways to educate children, of course you had background,
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.500]   a lot of experience, particularly with preschoolers,
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   and so this was kind of something close to your heart
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:25.940]   to study and to find what is the right way
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.220]   to educate children, and we can chuckle now,
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.860]   because young parents think there's gotta be one right way.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.020]   - There's so many right ways.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.400]   - Yeah, and it is a process,
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.040]   and there is grace built into it
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.740]   that a young parent may not realize.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.580]   - Okay, listeners, I want you to hear that.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.840]   There is grace built into homeschooling
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.100]   that you might not realize.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:07.220]   You don't have to find the one right way,
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.940]   'cause there's not one right way,
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.820]   and if you have more than one child,
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.780]   you've already internalized that whole idea,
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.740]   because the right way to teach child A to read
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.260]   is the one way that will not work for child B,
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.200]   almost guaranteed.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.000]   There's not one right way.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   There are very few mistakes
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.480]   from which you cannot recover as a homeschooler.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.100]   If you try one tack and it doesn't work,
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.240]   or it doesn't work well, or you just don't like it,
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.660]   you can stop, boot that to the curb,
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.860]   and try a different way, and it's okay.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:54.140]   Don't be afraid that you're gonna make a mistake.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.140]   And moms, if your husband needs to hear this,
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.960]   then stop the podcast, go find him,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.740]   and help him listen to this dad,
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.240]   who also is saying to you,
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.620]   "Yeah, I kinda just believed you
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.300]   "when you said we could do this,
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.300]   "and I saw good things, and I trusted you."
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.660]   - Well, another thing about our relationship
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.500]   is that even before we began dating,
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.980]   we worked shoulder to shoulder with children,
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.060]   and I knew how you dealt with children,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.560]   you knew how I dealt with children,
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.780]   and for our first married years,
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.400]   we were looking forward to the time
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.860]   when we would have our own children.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.860]   And so we both came into parenthood
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.840]   with more experience working with children
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.100]   than maybe is typical. - There are a lot.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.860]   - And that helped a lot. - It did.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.360]   - I mean, it helped us get on the same page
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.880]   in terms of parenting, not just educating.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   - Right, I think that both of us tend to be learners,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.960]   we both tend to be curious,
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.860]   we both tend to ask a lot of questions,
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.720]   we tend to be interested in a lot of different things,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.860]   and for those reasons, I think we continued
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.920]   to be interested in homeschooling.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.840]   I do know, I can remember when I went
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.960]   to my very first CC practicum,
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   and y'all, it looked way different way back then.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.960]   I mean, it was in one, we fit,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.400]   I think there were 24 of us
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.700]   at the first practicum I ever attended,
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.700]   and Lee was the speaker, and we spent three days
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.700]   in a second floor, un-air-conditioned Sunday school room
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.400]   with small chairs and a big whiteboard,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   which Lee wrote madly on for six hours every day
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.460]   while she talked to us about the beauties and benefits
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.200]   of a classical Christian education.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.760]   And I came home from that one of the very first days,
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   and we went out to eat, and I was talking to you about math,
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.520]   and the glory of math, which was not my favorite subject
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.780]   growing up, okay, and the glory of math,
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.320]   and how you could see God in math,
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.740]   and I was drawing these little diagrams
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.520]   on beverage napkins, and you looked at me and said,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.880]   "Who are you, and what has happened to you?"
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   And I was so excited about education at that point
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.560]   that I think, we had been homeschooling
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.880]   for several years by then.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.120]   When our girls jumped into the foundations program,
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.720]   one was in the fifth grade, and one was in the second grade,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.380]   so we had some years of homeschooling under our belt,
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.340]   but it was at the point where I discovered
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.960]   classical conversations that I really had confidence
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.900]   in the long view that we could stay the course,
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.040]   and I remember one of the things that appealed
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.880]   to you the most was looking at the challenge,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.200]   scope, and sequence.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.440]   - I don't even remember that.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.600]   - Isn't that funny?
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.120]   - What I do remember is you coming home,
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   and you were excited about math,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.680]   and you were teaching me all these things,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.000]   and I thought, wow, this really has lit your fire.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   It's grasped your imagination and your enthusiasm,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and so that was a selling point to me.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.560]   Of course, at that point, we, as you said,
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.680]   had been homeschooling for nine years,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.480]   and we were not considering stopping homeschooling,
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.000]   but we were wondering if we could throw in
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.480]   with this new organization, new to us organization,
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.680]   that some friends had kind of recruited you for.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.800]   - True.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   - And when it seemed to be a real fit for you
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.840]   as a mom and a teacher, it seemed like something
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.840]   really worth pursuing.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.480]   - Yeah, yeah, I really loved becoming involved
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.600]   as a challenge tutor, director at the very beginning,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.560]   because I loved seeing where the foundation's work
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.920]   was going to take these children,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.600]   that we really were giving them so much good stuff
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.560]   to think about that when they were old enough
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.240]   to think deeper thoughts, they would have some ammunition.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.960]   They would have some stuff to think about.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.480]   And I liked the plan that was laid out.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.280]   - Well, you had done enough research
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.360]   before you ever went to that practicum
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.720]   about classical education.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.800]   You knew what you were looking for.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.680]   You were kind of in the process of inventing the wheel
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.400]   on how that would work in a day-to-day child's curriculum.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.160]   And when you found that somebody else was a few years ahead
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   in inventing this wheel, it just was a natural fit.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.720]   - Absolutely, because you know what?
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.960]   If you've ever tried to do it, man,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.400]   September and October go great.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.000]   And November is kind of fun.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.040]   In December, you can do a lot of holiday stuff,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.640]   but January comes and man, the doldrums set in
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   and creating a classical Christian curriculum
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.920]   for your children, especially as they mature and grow
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.040]   and their skills develop and they're ready
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.640]   for new adventures, man, that was hard.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.600]   Writing all of that on my own was really hard.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   And so while we still loved exploring the world together,
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.360]   it was really awesome to have somebody
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.440]   who was setting out a blueprint for us of how to do that.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.560]   And that made it possible for us
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.360]   to look forward to continuing.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   - Well, our older daughter particularly seemed very curious,
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.040]   but so logical, and this seemed like a good curriculum
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.240]   for her, we felt like, especially by then,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.160]   we felt if she went to the public school system,
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.680]   she would just be bored and probably end up
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   causing trouble.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.840]   - Disruptive, shall we say.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.680]   - And so this seemed like a good curriculum
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.960]   where she could really be challenged.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.320]   - And enjoy learning.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   So did you enjoy learning alongside them as they grew up?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.320]   - I did enjoy it.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.020]   I wish I had plugged into it more.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:01.320]   They were being exposed to a lot
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.440]   that I never was exposed to in my education.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.260]   And I've kind of felt like I was an outsider.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.360]   I was behind because the three of you knew all this stuff
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.640]   and I didn't.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.640]   - I do remember the year after Sarah finished Challenge B,
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.440]   so three of us had been through multiple years
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.700]   of formal logic by then, and you were the only person
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.000]   who had not taken the logic course,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.780]   which is ironic since probably by nature,
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.680]   you were the most logical person of the four of us.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.000]   - Oh, maybe.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.760]   - That's really fun.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.080]   So what was the best thing about homeschooling?
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.840]   As you look back, because okay, spirit of full disclosure,
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.000]   both of our girls are grown.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.840]   They're both married.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.560]   We have a grandson now.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.000]   So we are looking beyond homeschooling.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.040]   So this is homeschooling and beyond a dad's perspective.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.640]   It is way beyond homeschooling.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.000]   So let me ask you this.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.760]   What was the best thing about homeschooling
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.280]   as you look back?
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.680]   - I think just being in touch with my children.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.000]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.680]   - And public school then wasn't as bad as maybe--
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.160]   - It seems to be now.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.480]   - Yes, it seems to be now, just based on news reports.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.280]   But I was never concerned about what my children
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.680]   might be learning in school.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.160]   And I knew who they were learning with,
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.800]   not just you, their mom,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.200]   but also their peers and their families.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.480]   But I just enjoy their company.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.320]   - Yeah.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.280]   - And that's such a blessing,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   just to be able to enjoy your being together as a family.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.520]   And we still enjoy that.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.040]   It's a lot different now, but we still enjoy it.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:57.880]   - Right.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.520]   So I think that was one of the great joys.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.640]   And it was also fun having them tell me stuff
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.600]   that they were learning.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.840]   - Oh, I like that.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.400]   I used to love to listen to them rattle off
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.920]   the things that they knew.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.720]   Or I liked watching them impress you
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.000]   with something that they knew that you were surprised
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.400]   to find that they knew.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.920]   - Yes, the timeline stands out.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.640]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   I like that.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.880]   - I like that you said that your favorite part
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.800]   or the best thing about homeschooling
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.720]   was spending time with your girls.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.560]   - Oh yeah.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.320]   - So dads, treasure that, treasure that.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.600]   - And I didn't, one of the regrets I have
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.320]   is that there were times when I could have been with them
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.000]   in community, in foundations,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.400]   but I felt like I was too busy.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.880]   I did have a flexible schedule.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.320]   I could have made it work, but I didn't.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.200]   - Right, okay, so that's a cautionary tale, parents.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:06.040]   Realize you don't get a second chance at some of this.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.640]   Now maybe we'll be able to go to foundations
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.440]   with our grandson in a few years.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.800]   That's good, okay.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.240]   So that was one of the best things about homeschooling.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.560]   What was one of the hardest things about homeschooling?
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.200]   - Well, again, you were the one
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.640]   mostly bearing the burden of it.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.640]   I think for me, when you became frustrated,
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.720]   that was hard for me.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:43.800]   When you didn't know how to help them write this paper
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:49.160]   or I know that you had to kind of relearn
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:55.280]   or learn for the first time stuff like chemistry
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   and physics. - Oh, my.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.360]   Some of the math of chemistry was utterly beyond
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.380]   what I could remember. - Yeah, and so that was hard
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.000]   for me to see you so frustrated.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.840]   And although I have a math background,
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.940]   I couldn't jump in and go, oh, yeah, sure,
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.160]   I can show you how this works.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.360]   - Well, 'cause a lot of learning, you guys, is sequential.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.920]   And as parents, if you don't keep up,
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.760]   as your child goes from easy to complex,
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.000]   you can't just easily jump in at complex
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.760]   and make it all turn out right.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.200]   And so that's another cautionary tale.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   If there's a subject with which you are utterly unfamiliar,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.700]   logic and mock trial come to mind,
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.740]   then you probably need to be in on it,
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.280]   sort of from the get-go, or you won't be as much help
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.440]   to your children as you hoped to be
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.600]   when they hit a hard patch.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.160]   - And you did learn along with them.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.000]   - Oh, gosh, yeah.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   - And I was kind of a bystander.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.560]   - Okay, okay.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.080]   - But yeah, cheerleader, maybe, hopefully.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:03.260]   So that, I do remember some angst
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:10.200]   and tears shed over science projects and--
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.040]   - Oh, my word, yes. - Stuff like that.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.240]   - Last minute, you know what?
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.000]   One of the hardest things to teach children
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.040]   is not necessarily academic in nature,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.560]   it's more life skills in nature.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   And so when your child fails to plan
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.700]   or does not have a realistic view of how long things take,
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.200]   then that bites not just the child,
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.280]   but the homeschooling parents as well,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.840]   and those can be hard times.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.440]   Those are hard lessons.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.080]   Good lessons are sometimes hard to learn.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.480]   And the thing about being a homeschooling family
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.080]   is that, you know what, it hardly ever just bites
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.200]   the one who causes it.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.160]   The problem bites all of us because we live in community
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.060]   and we love each other and we're trying to help each other.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.060]   And so, child A's botched science fair board bites us all
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:14.200]   because we're all scrambling to figure out
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.800]   how to fix it at the 11th hour.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.880]   - Well, and just the angst of,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.240]   "Oh, I wish I hadn't chosen this project."
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.960]   It's like, well, you did. - Three weeks ago.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.800]   - Right.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   - So that was one example of a frustration.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.160]   - Okay, you've mentioned a couple of things.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.720]   I've heard you say a couple of things
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.780]   that you wish you had done differently.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.420]   I want to ask you about those things.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.440]   What would you do differently?
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.160]   And they can be little practical things
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.920]   or big philosophical things.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.880]   - Well, I had an advantage and a disadvantage
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.200]   all rolled into one and that is that you're so good at this
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.080]   that I didn't feel like I needed to be micromanaging
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.880]   or even all that tuned into,
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.740]   'cause I knew that they were gonna be fine
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.720]   'cause you could take care of it.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.680]   And so that's a great advantage
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.560]   in that you were able to be a good homeschool teacher,
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.560]   but it's a disadvantage in that I was more hands off
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.120]   than I might have been
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.880]   if you were not so competent and capable,
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   then I could have rolled up my sleeves a little bit more
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.300]   with the whole process.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.560]   And so that's not something I've,
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.280]   I guess what I could have done differently
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   is just been more dialed in to what you're actually studying
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:51.200]   and the frustrations and maybe some of that learning
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.440]   along with them, I could have--
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.080]   - Yes, yes, you could have memorized the timeline
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.600]   with that. - Yeah, that's right.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.400]   - That would have been a great thing.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:06.620]   I think that having regrets is just part of what we do.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.700]   - Oh, it's part of life.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.260]   - And I'm asking you these questions
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.340]   because you have the long view
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.300]   because this is in the rear view mirror.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.900]   We're looking at homeschooling and beyond
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.960]   because you're past some of it.
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   But I do want to remind you of a thing that you did.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.900]   You became a director yourself.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.900]   You became a lead learner, not just in our home,
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.020]   but in our CC community where you had multiple years
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.580]   where you led a challenge one community.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.460]   And so you did practice the classical model
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.380]   in front of children, both your own and other people's.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.300]   And you did know what it was to dig in
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.760]   and learn something new or learn something old in a new way.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:05.660]   And so parents who are listening, I would encourage you,
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.460]   if you want to be involved in a classical education
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:16.900]   and you don't mind learning in front of other people,
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.360]   then becoming a director is awesome.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.060]   You will learn twice as much
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.260]   when you are trying to learn it
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.300]   in order to explain it to somebody else
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.920]   as you ever learned when you were reading it
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.220]   for your own edification.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.020]   And so that is the thing I want to tell you
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.900]   that you did really well.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:42.900]   You modeled lifelong learning for your girls.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.020]   - And it was fun, I had both of them in the challenge one.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.020]   - Yeah, and I have heard both of them tell people
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.000]   when they didn't know we were listening
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.900]   that learning is just what we do in our family.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.580]   And they have always watched you
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.260]   be willing to learn something.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.740]   So that is a good, good thing.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.740]   - Okay, so when the empty nest came several years ago
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.900]   for us now, what was the most surprising thing
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.360]   to you about the empty nest?
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.380]   - The most surprising thing?
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   Well, maybe the most surprising thing
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.180]   as I think about it today is probably
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.180]   that it did not bother me more.
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.460]   Because I've told this story so many times
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.420]   when we took our first daughter to college,
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.420]   that was easy, taking her to college was no problem at all.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.260]   What was hard was leaving her there
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.700]   and coming home without her.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.600]   And that, I was not prepared for that.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.520]   That just really hit me hard emotionally.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.020]   And maybe that's part of what prepared me then
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.860]   for the empty nest.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.920]   Of course it helped that our nest became empty
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.240]   when our younger daughter went to college,
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.680]   but the school was like half an hour from our house.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.120]   - So we could go see her if we really needed a fix.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.560]   - Yeah, and so I do feel some sympathy
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.480]   for parents who send their kids halfway across the country
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.000]   or somewhere, that would be really hard.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.660]   - One thing I think that helped us
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.460]   is that when our personal homeschool nest emptied,
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.100]   we were both still tutoring.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.120]   So we both still, we were both still investing
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.200]   in young people.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   - Right, it kind of scratched that itch.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.420]   - Yeah, it did, it really did.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.040]   So the nest was not completely empty.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.280]   What did you miss about home?
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.860]   Was there anything that you missed
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.180]   about homeschooling at home?
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.000]   - When our nest became empty?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.720]   - Yeah, when the girls were gone.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.840]   Was there anything about homeschooling that you missed?
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.420]   - I can't think of anything that I suddenly began to miss
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.420]   because it seemed like our children
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.120]   were headed in the right direction.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.620]   They were taking the next steps that they needed to.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:16.280]   And other than just not having children living at home,
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:24.320]   I don't really think I missed anything.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.800]   - I remember you saying that one of the things you missed
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   when the girls were gone is being in touch
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.400]   with current popular teen culture.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.600]   Like we didn't know the music anymore.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.360]   We didn't know the slang words anymore.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.200]   - That's true.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.640]   I mean, when we would take our children,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.400]   take them wherever they needed to go.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.640]   A lot of times we were driving
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.440]   and they would have a playlist that they could play music.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.480]   So yeah, I miss being able to know
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.000]   what the hot new artists are and that kind of thing.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.460]   The cultural stuff.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.640]   - I do remember joking with them
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.700]   that our music is a whole lot better than today's music.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.440]   - Yeah, and you were right.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   Okay, so empty nest, your children have grown and gone.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.880]   How have your interactions with your children changed?
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.680]   - I think it's been a gradual process because we,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.360]   and as parents, you learn this on the job, on the fly.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.040]   And that is the way you interact with your children
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.480]   has to evolve over time.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   And our goal was to invest more and more independence
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.080]   in them and overall, I think,
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.980]   well, we could ask them what they think,
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.840]   but I think that we were able to give them
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.640]   appropriate amounts of independence at appropriate times.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.300]   And so the way we interact with our children
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.120]   didn't take a sudden turn.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.320]   I guess when they moved out of the house,
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.100]   it took a sudden turn and that we didn't know
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.760]   how class went today necessarily, that kind of thing.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.820]   But overall, I think that we just adjusted
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.820]   our role in their lives gradually over time.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.720]   It didn't seem like a big change,
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.480]   big point of inflection somehow,
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.080]   oh, now it's all different.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.640]   'Cause it was always becoming different the whole time.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.840]   - And that's pretty awesome if you think about it
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   because they were able to gradually take up the reins
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.900]   of independence as we gradually relinquished
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.380]   the reins of being in charge,
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:54.180]   or at least having a hand, a lead rope, as it were.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.200]   And so, yeah, that's really pretty cool
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.140]   when you realize that your children are able
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:06.060]   to make really good decisions when they're on their own,
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.400]   because they learned to make good decisions
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.640]   while they were still at home with you.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.860]   - And for the most part, they were level-headed
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.860]   and responsible, we didn't have a real rebellious child.
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.920]   But for both of our children, they did make some choices
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.460]   we thought were probably not the most wise.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.940]   - Right.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.940]   - But we were able to hold on to the relationship
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.920]   as primary instead of them doing what we want them to do
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.900]   as primary.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.800]   - Right, that's really good, that's really good.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   What do you appreciate the most about your grown-up kids?
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.920]   - Watching them make good decisions.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.920]   And one of the most rewarding things of parenthood
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:05.000]   is seeing your children live out and speak out
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.760]   the things that we have been instilling in them.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.920]   Because when you're teenagers and you're telling them
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:19.240]   some of the wisdom of life, it just seems not to take.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.860]   It seems like they're just rolling their eyes
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.640]   and saying, "Yeah, what do you know?"
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.720]   - Right, right.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.720]   - One of the memories I have is with one of our daughters
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   I kept telling her about various things.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.780]   This is a life skill, you need to be able to do this.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.160]   And then when she was in college,
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.480]   she was telling her roommate who had been more sheltered
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.240]   than our daughter, she would tell her roommate,
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.000]   "This is a life skill, you need to be able to do this."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.960]   - You felt vindicated, I'm sure.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.320]   - I was kind of surprised that it sank in
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.920]   more than I had thought it.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   And so parents can take heart knowing that you may feel
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.120]   like you're just talking till you're blue in the face
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.040]   and they're, "They're not getting any of this."
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.120]   But they are probably getting more than they're letting on.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.640]   - They are probably internalizing more
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.100]   than you ever remember giving out.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.540]   - Well, that's true 'cause they're watching our example
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.080]   as well as our words.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.440]   - Yes, that's a cautionary tale there too.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.560]   They're watching and they will emulate the good, the bad
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.080]   and the ugly, but you just have to deal with that.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.540]   - And that's one of the most frustrating things
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.400]   of parenthood is seeing your child do that thing
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.400]   that you set the example for that is not really helpful.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.000]   And so then you're not just annoyed with them,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.280]   but you're mad at yourself.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.080]   Well, let me ask you this as we come to the end of our time,
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   how can you see the fruits of a classical Christian education
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.060]   in the women your girls have become?
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:08.160]   - They seem to be willing to embrace challenge.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.600]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   - And they are not afraid of being stretched.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.120]   - Yes, I can agree.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   - And they feel like they have the tools that they need
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   to figure out a situation and admittedly they have tools
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:38.640]   that we couldn't conceive of when our children were little.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.560]   - True, but they wield them with confidence
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.620]   that we perhaps did not have either.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.920]   - Right, I'm just saying that they can pull out their phones
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.960]   and Google something to get an answer,
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.800]   which was a luxury that we had when they were little,
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   but they can approach life with some confidence,
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.940]   not feeling concerned that they're going to be
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.740]   taken advantage of in a business deal, for example.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:11.120]   But they still ask for our wisdom and input,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:15.720]   which is nice to be able to offer that when requested.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.960]   But classical education has given them tools
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.480]   to not just read a book and write a paper,
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   it's given them tools to approach any task
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:36.900]   or situation or difficulty with a general roadmap
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:45.120]   that can move them through learning what they need to learn,
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.320]   assessing the situation and moving to action.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.300]   - I would agree, I love that.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.160]   I think when I look at the girls,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.320]   I can see the fruits of the classical education in them.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.240]   They have learned to ask good, incisive questions.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:09.440]   They have learned to break tasks down into smaller pieces
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.960]   and work the plan.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.400]   They have learned to listen intently
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.240]   to arguments that are not their own
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:29.220]   and view with grace and mercy and respect
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.760]   people who hold a different position.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.640]   - And they're willing to listen
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.040]   to other people's points of view.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:35.880]   - Yes.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.320]   - And they're not crystallized in their understanding
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.600]   of life in the world.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.960]   - Right.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.680]   - They have a basis, a solid foundation,
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   but they don't dismiss out of hand other points of view.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:58.320]   They're willing to evaluate and consider,
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.600]   and even if they're not persuaded by those arguments,
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.200]   they can be gracious toward those who hold--
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.320]   - They know how to love their neighbor,
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.800]   even if their neighbor is not like them.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.200]   And I appreciate that.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.840]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   How can you see the fruits of a classical education
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.900]   in yourself, can you?
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.800]   - I do feel like I can take a task
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.240]   and break it down into smaller steps.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.760]   I feel like I have some confidence
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.680]   that I can take on something new.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.520]   - Yeah.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.920]   - Which I'm doing now.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.760]   - Right.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:00.800]   - So as a farmer, and so that's a whole other world
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:08.080]   from a lot of things that we're more familiar with.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.040]   It's kind of a lost art.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.040]   And so I am realizing that there's just so much grammar
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:26.080]   that I need to have in agriculture and horticulture.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.880]   And every time I read something
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.800]   or hear a podcast about gardening or farming,
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.960]   and they're throwing around terms that I don't know,
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.280]   I realize, oh, that's vocabulary that I need to investigate.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.120]   - Yeah.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:49.760]   - And it all builds just like any discipline.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   It's all, you add things on top of previous knowledge.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:02.000]   And clearly with something like farming,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.080]   it's a practical,
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:10.380]   the rhetoric of it is actually doing something
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:15.160]   with plants and animals and soil and trees
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   and actually working it out and doing things.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.180]   - Cool, very cool.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.860]   I appreciate you sharing that.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.600]   Okay, I have one last question.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.520]   I ask this of every guest, so you get it too.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   How are you, David, an everyday educator?
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.520]   - Well, there are two elements to that.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.280]   One of the elements is first learning.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.240]   And I always love learning stuff.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.200]   I'm constantly listening to podcasts and reading books.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.960]   I've been working lately on reading more literature
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.320]   instead of just nonfiction.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:02.820]   But then the other element besides learning stuff
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.560]   is sharing stuff.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.420]   And so I've got various groups
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.420]   of where I'm able to do Bible studies and so forth
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:20.000]   that give me opportunity to invest in people's lives.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.060]   But even as our children are adults,
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.580]   I still like teaching them stuff.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.800]   - And they still like learning stuff.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.120]   - Yeah, and our sons-in-law a lot of times
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   will ask our take on something, our opinion about something,
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.540]   ask for advice sometimes.
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.700]   And so it's nice to be able to share those things.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   So I think that you and I are just wired as educators anyway.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.980]   - Yeah, true.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:56.320]   - Sometimes our children would ask you something
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.060]   and I would think, "Why didn't you ask me?"
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.980]   And the answer is, "I didn't want to know that much."
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.200]   (laughing)
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   - That's true.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.240]   Do I want daddy amount of information
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.180]   or mama amount of information?
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.540]   Well, I really appreciate you sharing
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.740]   with the listeners today your perspective
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.800]   of homeschooling and beyond.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.240]   It is really refreshing a lot of times
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.280]   to hear a dad's view of homeschooling
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.220]   and what made it great, what made it scary,
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.080]   especially if you can look in the rear-view mirror
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.220]   and see what it gave you and your family.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.080]   So thanks for sharing today.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:37.920]   - Well, I'm glad you said that
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.300]   about seeing it in the rear-view mirror.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   I recently heard somebody talk about in Exodus 34,
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:49.300]   I think it's a passage where Moses sees God.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:54.600]   But if you recall, God puts Moses
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.120]   in a cleft of the rock, covers him up,
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.920]   and God passes by while he proclaims his name.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.200]   But then he removes his hand,
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.440]   and Moses sees God from the back.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   That's how we can see God in life, is looking back,
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.680]   and we see God's hand at work.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.720]   And we want to see God moving forward,
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   and I think in a lot of ways by faith we do that.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.960]   But sometimes the sight is so much more clear
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   as we look back on life's experiences,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.080]   and some of the things that break our hearts the most
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.200]   are so often the things that God uses the most
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   to develop us into better disciples of Jesus
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.480]   and people who love God and love people more.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.480]   - That might be the best thing
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.100]   that you've said this whole podcast.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.440]   That's a great way to end it.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.440]   Thank you so very much.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.680]   Families, I hope that you have enjoyed hearing
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.040]   about homeschooling and beyond a dad's perspective.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.800]   I have one more thing to, well, maybe it's a reminder
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.960]   for you, maybe it's the first time you've heard
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.680]   about the Math Map.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.880]   It is an all-new Foundations Through Challenge
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.960]   for Math curriculum that our CC founder, Lee Bortons,
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.080]   is developing.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:18.040]   It's called the Math Map, and it is specifically designed
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:22.120]   to teach homeschool parents the language of math.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:26.560]   Just like a foreign language, math has a specific vocabulary
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.480]   and concepts and notation that are often unfamiliar at first.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.640]   So if we spend some time discovering
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.360]   and becoming more familiar with this language of math,
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.320]   we will have an easier, more exciting,
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.420]   more thoroughly delightful time
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.000]   acquainting our children with this.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.580]   Right now, Classical Conversations members
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.580]   can access an exclusive sneak peek of the Math Map.
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.860]   It's called Naturals, and it's on CC Connected.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.360]   If you want to find out what the Math Map is all about,
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.080]   you need to hop on it, because the beta release
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.020]   of Math Map Naturals will not stick around
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:14.020]   on CC Connected forever, so be sure that you work through it
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:15.300]   while it's still available.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.920]   To get to these materials, log on
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.900]   to your CC Connected account, navigate
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.840]   to the Learning Center, it should be on the left toolbar,
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:28.880]   and search for the Math Map, okay?
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.660]   It can be a delightful turn on your homeschool journey.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.260]   All right, well, it has been great to be with you guys
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.900]   this afternoon, I appreciate you spending
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.520]   a little bit of time with us, and I will see you next week.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.360]   Bye bye.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.140]   (gentle music)
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.200]   you
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:57.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
