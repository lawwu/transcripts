[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   The words to which I would like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.600]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6, verses 10 to 13.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.200]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:24.000]   Put on the hollow armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.400]   devil; for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.320]   powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.800]   in high places.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.280]   Wherefore, take unto you the hollow armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.760]   the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.760]   Now we are concerned particularly at the moment about this first exhortation about being strong
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.200]   in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.320]   Here is the first great thing we've got to grasp in this struggle, this conflict, this
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.920]   wrestling against the devil and all his powers that are weighed behind him.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.760]   And there's nothing more important therefore than for us to understand what this means.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.640]   And we've been taking time to do this, showing that it isn't a doctrine teaching some kind
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.320]   of passivity, which just tells us that we hand it over and just wait and watch for the
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.920]   victory that is won for us.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.320]   We have seen rather that it is an exhortation to us to act with all our might and main,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.920]   realizing that we can only be empowered and enabled by the power of God and of the Lord
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.440]   Jesus Christ.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.120]   And last time we tried to show by a number of illustrations, particularly from the scriptures,
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.880]   how this works out in practice.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.920]   Faith means that we believe this word, we therefore act.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.120]   As our Lord said to the men, "With a withered hand who couldn't move his hand at all, stretch
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.600]   forth thine hand."
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.360]   The men made the effort and found he could do it.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.200]   So this great principle here works in actual daily practice.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.040]   So that there is therefore an adequate explanation in that way.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.360]   The command carries implicit in it, this enabling power.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.240]   And therefore we must rid ourselves of any notion of passivity, and of doing nothing,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.240]   and of handing it over, a false notion of the rest of faith.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.920]   The rest of faith means that you rest in the word of God, that you have faith to believe,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.680]   that as your day so your strength will be, that you are to work out your salvation with
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.400]   fear and trembling, because you know that it is God that worketh in you, both the will
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.200]   and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   Very well.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.840]   Now then, and we've been seeing how therefore the thing for us to concentrate on positively
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.760]   is the realization of the power that is given to us in the rebirth, a seed of life, with
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.120]   power and life and vigor in it.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.640]   We must see to it that this grows and develops.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.800]   We do so by taking the appropriate food, here it is, drink, prayer, exercise, practice,
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.640]   doing the work, and so on.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   Very well.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.800]   All along we've been concentrating on what I may call the positive side of this teaching,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.840]   and it is of course the most essential of all.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.480]   But to make the statement complete, we must add a certain amount on the negative, because
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.400]   this again, I think you'll all agree, is something that is absolutely essential.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.560]   Let's put it simply like this.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.920]   Let's use the analogy that has been more or less in our minds from the beginning.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.960]   That is to say, the analogy of the growth and development of the human being in a physical
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   sense.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.240]   There's the helpless infant, yes, but not devoid of strength.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.520]   He's got strength, can't walk, but he can kick his legs about and move his hands and
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   arms.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   There is strength there.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.080]   Very well, and we've been applying that and showing how that is to be developed and
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.840]   fastened and trained, but you see, using this same analogy, there are certain negative truths
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.800]   which are also of very vital importance for us.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.760]   In other words, if we are to remain healthy and strong and vigorous and powerful, there
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.320]   are certain things that we've got to avoid.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.960]   The fight for health, if you may so call it, or the care of health, has these two aspects,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.920]   positive and negative.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.160]   It's no use trying to build yourself up if on the other hand you're doing certain things
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.200]   that are of necessity going to sap your energy and your vitality and are in danger of robbing
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.440]   you of your health altogether.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.280]   The strongest man alive, if he walks into an infected chamber, will probably become
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.480]   a victim to the disease.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.800]   In other words, you see, there is obviously a negative aspect to the whole of this teaching.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.040]   So we must avoid in general anything that tends to weaken us, to sap our energy, or
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   to rob us of our spiritual health, out of which comes our spiritual energy and vigour.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.480]   So that I want to call attention this morning to certain things that we've got to avoid
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.480]   also.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:56.640]   Now then, let's work out this analogy.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.120]   Teaching I think would be quite obvious.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.480]   What's the first thing we have to avoid?
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.800]   No, it's dissipation of energy.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   Dissipation of energy.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.720]   It doesn't matter how much energy you've got, if you misuse it, dissipate it, throw
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:16.460]   it away, the result will be that you'll have less of it, and you'll become less effective
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.460]   and efficient.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.440]   This is, I think, quite obvious in the physical realm.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.360]   Many a man who has become weak who was once strong, just because he's been overdoing
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.720]   it in various ways.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:37.240]   He's overstretched himself, he's overstrained himself, and the result is, developed a tired
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.640]   heart, so-called, or a weak heart, and eventually becomes a man who has lost his health and
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.360]   has to exercise great care.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.040]   Well now, this is equally true in the spiritual realm.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.480]   And I sometimes think that this is one of the greatest dangers confronting many evangelical
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.960]   people particularly at this present time.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.360]   Indeed, I'm quite sure that I'm right in this respect.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.480]   I was asked not so long ago to address a certain conference of people, Christian evangelical
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.160]   people, and the theme suggested was this very thing that I'm talking about, that a number
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.440]   of Christian people in professions and various other walks of life were troubled about themselves,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.120]   that they seemed to have lost the edge of their spiritual life, didn't enjoy the Bible
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.760]   as they used to, didn't enjoy praying as they used to, and so on, were unhappy about
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.240]   the spiritual state and condition into which they'd got.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.360]   Now I say there are many like that, and I've no doubt at all, myself, and no hesitation
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:48.520]   in asserting that the commonest cause of that, in my experience as a pastor, is simply due
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.880]   to dissipation of energy.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:58.280]   Now the apostle talks about his own countrymen as having zeal without knowledge.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.960]   That's not confined to unbelievers.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.840]   That's quite a common complaint amongst believing people, zeal without knowledge, by which I
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.920]   mean thoughtless activity, what can well be described as activism.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.720]   We're all meant to be active, I've already dealt with it.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.800]   That came into the positive side, and as I pointed out, there's nothing that is so guaranteed
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.320]   to increase our strength as to be active.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.480]   Yes, but you've got to know how to be active.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   There's all the difference in the world between a true activity and activism, a true activity
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.600]   and the dissipation of energy.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:49.720]   And the way I think to understand this is that our activities must be thoughtful, they
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.800]   must be disciplined, they must be governed, they must be directed.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   Now, one can well understand this danger and how it comes in.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:07.760]   Of course, it happens to be the whole popular teaching at the present time.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.360]   We must all be doing something, give the new convert something to do.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.960]   That's the great phrase, which is, of course, quite unscriptural to start with.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.080]   The pastoral epistles will tell you almost the exact opposite.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.200]   They'll tell you not to give a novice things to do, that he's not fit to do them yet, and
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.000]   that it's dangerous for him, that he may be lifted up with pride as the devil was, but
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.280]   it's the controlling teaching.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.760]   We must all be doing something here, there, and everywhere.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   Activism.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:42.200]   Now, this is a very dangerous condition for the soul, because what generally happens is,
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:49.240]   as I'm suggesting to you, that such people become over-tired, they become over-strained.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.000]   And what suffers first and foremost is the spiritual turn of their lives.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Now, this, you will all agree, is something that happens in every realm and department
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   of life.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.720]   Any man who overdoes things, I don't care what he's doing, will soon discover that the
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.800]   quality of his work begins to suffer.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.920]   That's the first thing always that goes, is the quality.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.960]   A man who preaches too much, who works too hard in the ministry, a man who acts too much,
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   I don't care what he's doing, a man who sings too much, the first thing to go will be the
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.540]   quality.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.240]   The general public won't recognize this, they won't spot it for some time.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.960]   The critics will recognize it.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.120]   They'll say, "The man's carrying on in a sort of momentum.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.480]   He isn't on top of it as he used to be.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.040]   The fineness isn't there.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.280]   He's losing something."
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.320]   And it's simply because the man's overdoing it.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.480]   He's getting tired.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.800]   And the result of this is that he is losing this vital something.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:59.560]   Now then, this is, I say, something which is very true in the spiritual realm.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.320]   And there are many people who, with a very good intention, feeling that they must be
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.120]   doing something to justify their Christianity, often they get into this state because they're
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.560]   afraid of the criticisms of this popular teaching at the present time, that they sit back and
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.080]   do nothing, taking in, not giving out, you know, the clichés that are being used so
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.080]   much.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.080]   And because of their fear of this, they must be doing things.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.640]   It's a very great problem, this.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.480]   There are many Christian professional men who are out doing something every night of
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   the week.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.880]   It's even wrong from the standpoint of family life.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.560]   But I'm not concerned about that this morning.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.960]   I'm concerned about the danger to themselves.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.680]   And they find themselves exhausted.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.880]   They've got nothing to give in the end, and they're just mechanically doing something.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.000]   And it is of very little value.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.240]   Now I call all that dissipation of energy.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.560]   It's unintelligent activity.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.840]   A man's got to sit down and plan his life.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.080]   He's got to decide what he can do and what he can't do.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.240]   And he must be resolute, doesn't matter what people say.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.600]   He is the man who's in the best position to know how much he can do, when he's to do it,
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   and where he's to do it.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.760]   Never allow yourself to be dictated to by others.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.600]   Don't allow the thing to do, to determine what you do.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:27.960]   We must always be in charge, I say, of ourselves, lest we become weary and tired and exhausted,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.640]   simply through dissipating, throwing away our energy.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.440]   Well now, this isn't the only way in which this happens.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.440]   It's I say, the commonest of all, but there are many other ways.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.040]   Isn't there a danger to some of us, that we dissipate a lot of energy in just talking
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.080]   too much?
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:58.840]   Not talking, talking so much that we never stop to think, that we never stop to meditate.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.360]   We are all great talkers.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:08.000]   We all talk far too much, and we waste a lot of energy.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.960]   Conversation can be very tiring, very exhausting.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:19.160]   And through sheer talk, there are many people who find themselves in spiritual trouble.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:26.200]   Oh no, we must learn to follow the exhortation of the scriptures.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   Think more.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.520]   Slow to speak, says James, slow to speak.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:39.120]   Let's make sure that we don't go through life just talking, and never really thinking,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.920]   and understanding the truth, and growing in grace and in knowledge.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.400]   We've got to discipline ourselves in this matter.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.640]   I don't stay with it.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:55.880]   Then another form of course, which this takes, is the dissipation of energy in mere argument
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.560]   and disputation and wrangling.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.880]   Here's a terrible danger.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.560]   There are so many warnings given to us in the scripture about this, let me give you
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.200]   some of them.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.920]   Take 1 Timothy, first chapter, verses 4 and 6.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.880]   He says, "Neither give ye to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions,
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.080]   rather than godly edifying which is in faith."
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.000]   Listen to him again in verse 6.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.160]   He says, "Some have swerved away, have turned aside, and to vain jangling, spend the whole
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.720]   of their lives just arguing and disputing."
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.440]   Listen again to the second epistle of Timothy, that chapter which I read at the beginning,
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   the second chapter.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.920]   There are quite a number of references to it there.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.320]   Look at verse 14.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.800]   "Now these things put them in remembrance, judging them before the Lord, that they strive
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.480]   not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.840]   See, they were giving the impression they were very wonderful, arguing and debating,
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.600]   but there was no profit there.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.760]   "Now my dear friend, however much you may be arguing about truth, if you are not growing
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.240]   spiritually as the result of it, do less of it, perhaps for the time being cut it out
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.520]   altogether and begin to examine your soul."
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.120]   No profit, and the subverting of the hearers.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.680]   Then listen again in verse 16.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.080]   "Shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness."
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.400]   And that's always the end of that kind of thing.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   Verse 23.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:30.920]   "Foolish and unlearned questions abide, knowing that they do gender strifes."
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.960]   Now these are things that we must avoid.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   If you'd like one more, listen to Titus 3.9.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:43.360]   "Avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law, for
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.760]   they are unprofitable."
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:51.720]   And they, the test of everything, must be always whether it's profitable.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.120]   Profitable to our own souls, profitable to other people.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:03.160]   I have an awful feeling that there is a great dissipation of energy, sheer waste of energy,
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.040]   in pointless disputations and wranglings.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.560]   My dear friend, if you are not growing as the result of your activity in that respect,
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.360]   you better start examining yourselves again.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.040]   If you know so much, well, you ought to be showing it in your life.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.680]   "The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   The Lord knoweth them that are his."
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   Yes.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.200]   "And let him that believeth these things depart from iniquity."
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   We must always keep these things going together.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.520]   Now, this of course merits a whole morning to itself and perhaps more.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.840]   It's a very difficult matter, because we are told two things in the Scripture.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.600]   We are told and exhorted to contend earnestly for the faith.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.960]   That's Jude, isn't it?
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.680]   Contend earnestly for the faith that was once and for all delivered to the saints.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.720]   And there is great need of that at this present time.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.800]   The Apostle thanks these Philippians to whom he writes in the next epistle that they have
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:05.160]   stood with him in the defense and proclamation of the Gospel.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.000]   And you and I are called upon to do that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.520]   Never more so than at the present time.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   But you see, we've got to keep to a position which is between two extremes.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.920]   Some people who never defend the faith at all.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.640]   They say they're just nice, good people.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.840]   They don't argue, they don't understand, they're just good.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.960]   Well, that's a very unscriptural position to take up.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.120]   We are meant to contend earnestly for the faith.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.520]   Yes, but there's one extreme, here's the other.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:45.880]   We are never to become guilty of this vain disputation, vain wrangling.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:54.920]   We must not become such that we are just always criticizing and always arguing.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.920]   That's equally bad.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.200]   There is a middle position between the two.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.800]   The servant of the Lord says the Apostle must not strive.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   Here it is.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:10.200]   You've got to live somewhere between contending for the faith and striving.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.640]   Striving means that your spirit is wrong.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.520]   And once your spirit becomes wrong, your motive becomes wrong.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.840]   You tend to pride yourself as being a defender of the faith.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.900]   And you lose your spiritual quality.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.240]   You lose everything that appeals.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.960]   Now, this is a terrible danger.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.200]   And first and foremost, of course, to a preacher like myself.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.040]   I've known men myself in my own life.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.600]   I can think of two men in particular who started off with a great ministry.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.240]   A ministry under which people were converted and in which people were built up.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.480]   The two men I'm referring to ended as just contenders.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.080]   And they attracted a crowd of people to listen to them on Sunday nights.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:56.240]   Oh, simply people who enjoy a kind of spiritual dogfight.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.720]   Wondering who was to have it next.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.420]   Who was to be attacked.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.440]   And there is a kind of mentality that enjoys that.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.280]   And the more you give it, the more it enjoys it.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   That's very bad.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.320]   The two are bad.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.160]   We must contend, but we must never strive.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.800]   And we've got to walk between the two.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.080]   If a man begins to strive, well, he is dissipating his energy.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.120]   These two men were very able men and very great preachers.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   But they spoiled their ministries.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.120]   They crossed this line.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   They began to strive.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.680]   And the power went.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.280]   And in the end, they became more or less entirely ineffective.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.320]   Well, let me leave that.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.440]   Work it out for yourselves.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.400]   Dissipation of energy.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   The second heading I would suggest is this.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:48.640]   That having avoided that danger, we must now avoid spending too much time in what I would
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   call enervating atmospheres.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640]   Enervating atmospheres.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.200]   It doesn't matter how strong you are.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.080]   If you are in a wrong atmosphere, if there's too much humidity, you won't feel very strong.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.800]   It'll sap your energy and your vitality.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.840]   Too hot, too humid.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   You just feel limp.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.960]   No, you're a very strong person.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.840]   We all know something about that.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.960]   Well, this again is equally true in the Christian life.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.320]   There are certain atmospheres which are very enervating.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.320]   What do I mean?
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.960]   Well, I mean things like this, looking at it purely from the personal, individual standpoint
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.800]   first.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:37.680]   It's possible for us to waste a lot of time through sheer lack of discipline.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.760]   And there's nothing I know of that is more enervating than that.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.760]   You can just sit about and do nothing.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.320]   And the more you do of that, the less you'll be able to do.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.400]   Just to laze and to be slack, it's thoroughly enervating.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.320]   This is entirely, I say, due to lack of discipline.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.440]   Now, it doesn't mean that you're doing bad things of necessity.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:12.560]   You can just waste your time in doing nothing, or in doing things that are hardly worth doing.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.800]   I remember a man once giving advice to ministers.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:22.960]   He was an old man, and he was warning ministers especially against the morning newspaper.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.160]   He said he'd discovered in his own ministry that somehow or another he seemed to spend
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   most of the morning in going through his newspaper.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.320]   And then suddenly would realize about eleven or half past eleven that the morning had gone,
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.320]   and he'd done nothing.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.400]   That's the sort of thing I mean.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.720]   It's right a man like that should read a newspaper, so that he knows the contemporary situation.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.880]   Yes, but if he wastes all his morning reading newspapers or just talking to people, it's
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.880]   of no value.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:53.440]   I knew another man who had a preaching gift, but nothing ever came of it.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   Why?
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.820]   Because he used to go out every morning and talk to people on the streets.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.120]   Everybody praised him, what an affable nice man he was.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.840]   Yes, but he wasn't doing his work.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.960]   He wasn't reading, he wasn't preparing himself for the ministry.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.340]   Let's apply all this to ourselves.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:16.520]   If you get into this slack condition, you can waste your whole life doing nothing, and
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.520]   it's utterly profitless.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.280]   It's absent of energy.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.720]   Even taking it outside ourselves, spending too much time in wrong company.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.080]   Now I don't mean of necessity bad company.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.560]   At the moment I'm not thinking of bad company.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.320]   I'm just thinking of company that is not really positively helpful in a spiritual sense.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.040]   Of course, we've got to be clear again about this.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.000]   We mustn't cut ourselves off from such people, otherwise we'll never be able to help them.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.800]   But again, that's one extreme, the other is that you spend too much time with them.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.160]   I'm not suggesting you become a monk or a hermit and go out of life.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.360]   No, that's all wrong.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.560]   That's not New Testament, that's false asceticism.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:06.000]   But then the other danger is that you spend too much time with them.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.040]   Just talking, not about bad things, but about things that really don't matter very much
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   at all.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.560]   This is what is called in the scriptures the world, of course.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.700]   The world is the enemy of the Christian.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.780]   You don't go out of it, but you mustn't spend too much time in it.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.280]   If you spend too much of your time in a worldly atmosphere, you'll find that you lose the
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.440]   edge of your spiritual life.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.920]   There's nothing wrong inherently in looking at a television or listening to a radio, but
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.640]   if you spend too much time at it, I'll guarantee you, you won't be able to pray so well, and
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.280]   you lose your taste for the scriptures.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.540]   Now we've got to walk on a knife edge in these matters.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.720]   You don't become extreme on one side or the other, but you've got to watch, and of course
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.960]   you can always tell by examining yourself and your strength.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:00.800]   Is there somebody listening to me who is feeling that there's something lacking spiritually,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   that you've lost the edge?
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.920]   You are not enjoying these things as you used to and as you know you ought to.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   Well I just ask you that, how much time are you spending with these other things?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.320]   Why do you do so?
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.160]   This is an absolute rule.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.020]   The atmosphere immediately affects the constitution.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:25.680]   So just make certain that you're not spending too much of your time in that kind of atmosphere,
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.080]   and then of course it can become worse.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.760]   The apostle has already warned us in this epistle to the Ephesians about what he talks,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.160]   "foolish talking and jesting."
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.880]   We are not to be pompous, we are not to take ourselves too seriously, but that's a very
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.200]   different thing from foolish talking and jesting.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:53.800]   I'm often surprised at hearing of Christian men and others indulging in this foolish talking
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   and jesting.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:02.460]   Let's make sure, my friends, that we're not producing a wrong atmosphere by this kind
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.120]   of thing.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.560]   There is a sense of rightness in all these matters.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.040]   That belongs to the world, doesn't belong to us.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.160]   This is the instruction of the scripture.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.480]   Worldliness of course has many forms.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.160]   There are some very specific dangers.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:25.200]   Let me just read you what the apostle tells Timothy in the first epistle again, first
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.800]   chapter, verse six.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   He says, "They that will be rich fall into temptation and dismay, and into many foolish
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.280]   and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:44.200]   For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they averred
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.320]   from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.280]   But thou, O man of God, flee these things."
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.800]   Now be clear about this.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.840]   It's the love of money that he's condemning.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:02.520]   Money as such is not evil if a man uses it properly as a steward of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.840]   But the moment a man begins to love it, I am old enough to be able to say that I've
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.440]   seen many a good man go wrong at this point.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.920]   The love of money got hold of him.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.480]   Once that happens, there's always a lowering of the spiritual temperature.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.160]   You're always losing something of your spiritual vigor.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.760]   I've known cases of men who converted out of a very evil life, and because of their
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.440]   conversion began to pay attention to business or to their work, and got on and succeeded.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.400]   And I've had the miserable experience of watching them falling to this trap.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.200]   Before they threw their money away, now they begin to love it.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   You see, you're always walking between extremes.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.720]   Here's another one.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.200]   And this is another cause of loss of spiritual vigor and energy and of being strong in the
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.840]   Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.840]   The innovating atmosphere of respectability.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.600]   Here's a very common condition in the church.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.080]   I sometimes wonder whether this isn't the greatest curse of all at the present time.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.760]   The statistics at Ennui do prove quite clearly that for some reason or another, Christianity
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.960]   today is not touching the working classes of this country.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.840]   Why not?
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.840]   Is it, I sometimes wonder, because we are giving the impression that it is something
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.240]   only for the respectable middle classes, lower, middle, and upper middle classes?
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.320]   Let's examine ourselves about this.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.800]   Are we afraid of the Spirit?
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.640]   Are we guilty of quenching the Spirit?
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.840]   Are we afraid of life and vigor and power?
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.840]   Respectability.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.000]   Oh, how often have I seen this again.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:59.840]   Men who started with fire have just become respectable, nice Christians, utterly useless,
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.160]   without any energy and vigor and power.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.520]   Again, let me illustrate it from the realm of the ministry.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.360]   I've known many a man who went into the ministry, called of God undoubtedly, with a passion
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.040]   for souls and preaching power.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:19.640]   I've seen them end off as just good pastors, good visitors.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.560]   Visiting is a part of a pastor's ministry.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:29.280]   But if a man becomes just a nice man, a good pastor, a nice man to have in the home and
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.040]   who will drink a cup of tea with you and say, "A good pastor, what a tragedy that a prophet
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.440]   should end as just a nice man and a good pastor."
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.920]   Well, you see, here we are.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.440]   We are always walking between these terrible dangers, but there's nothing that can be
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:55.720]   so enervating as this kind of nice, respectable atmosphere in which we are afraid of almost
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:02.840]   anything and above all, afraid of the power of the Holy Ghost quenching the Spirit.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.200]   Well, you can see there are endless applications of this.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.680]   This is, of course, the real background and rationality of the teaching in 2 Corinthians
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.800]   6 about not being unequally yoked together with unbelievers, which applies, of course,
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.480]   to marriage and to marriage only.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.680]   That's why a Christian is not to marry an unbeliever.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:28.080]   He's putting himself into the wrong atmosphere, which is bound to set his spiritual energy
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.080]   and vitality.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.080]   It's inevitable.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.720]   The very fact that he's thus associated with and bound to someone who hasn't got spiritual
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.400]   life and understanding, he's the one that's going to suffer, not the other.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.960]   So we are told not to be unequally yoked together to unbelievers.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.760]   Very well, now I must leave it at that.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.160]   I'm just giving you principles to suggest that you work it out for yourselves.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.960]   Dissipation of energy, enervating atmosphere.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:01.120]   Thirdly, avoid diseases and infections.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.520]   You see, I'm going up the scale.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.400]   We are not now talking merely about enervating atmosphere.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.040]   That, though that is, there's something worse.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:18.960]   That is a diseased atmosphere, a place in which there is active infection.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.520]   If you know that there's infection in a house or in a room, well, the obvious thing
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.760]   to do is to avoid going there, unless you have to go there for some reason or another.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.160]   You shouldn't walk into infection.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.560]   It's a very foolish thing to do.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.680]   Now again, of course, you've got to be careful.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.320]   There are extremes here once more.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.280]   You may be so afraid of infections that you never go out at all.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.940]   And you'll end perhaps by living in some sort of glass house.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:50.440]   And there you'll die of this enervated condition and in a mission.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.840]   No, no.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.440]   We've got to use this spiritual balance and common sense everywhere.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.440]   But what do I mean?
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.640]   Well, I mean this.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.240]   The Bible's full of it.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.280]   Avoid bad company.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.600]   If I've told you of the danger of more or less innocent company which isn't spiritual,
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.000]   well, how much more is that true about bad company?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.840]   Listen to the psalmist in Psalm 1.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.880]   "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.200]   the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful."
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.880]   He's a blessed man then.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   He's the right man.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   He's the happy man.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.960]   That's the man that's going to know the blessing of the Lord.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.960]   Why?
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.040]   Because he avoids this dangerous atmosphere.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.600]   If you walk in the counsel of the ungodly, of intimate friendships with people who are
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:46.040]   literally ungodly and evil and bad, they're bound to affect you.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.560]   You stand in the way of sinners and put yourself where you know they're going to come, well,
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.500]   it's not surprising if you fall.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:58.080]   And if you sit in the seat of the scornful, you will soon lose the edge.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.400]   Oh, this has happened so often.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.080]   Very well, there's only one thing to do.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   Avoid it.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   Avoid bad company.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.440]   Avoid it as the plague, as the expression puts it.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:16.160]   For it is the plague, the plague of hell, the plague of the devil.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.800]   All that is foul, keep clear of it.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.760]   I like the apostles' term, flee.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   Run away from it.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.680]   Get as far away from it as you can.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.040]   This is the only thing to do with bad company.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.720]   Very well, I say once more that the Bible is full of this.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.200]   You'll find very instructive teaching about this in 1 Corinthians 5.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.420]   At the end of that chapter, the apostle deals with it in a very interesting manner and again
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:49.120]   shows us this perfect balance that always characterizes the scriptural teaching.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.280]   Let me read you 1 Corinthians 5, 9 to 11.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.240]   I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.880]   Now, here's the balance.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:03.920]   Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners,
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.400]   or with idolaters, for then ye must need to go out of the world.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.680]   But now I have written unto you not to keep company with any man that is called a brother
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:17.600]   be a fornicator, or a covetous, or a idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.520]   with such an one known not to eat.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.000]   You don't keep company with a brother who's guilty of all that.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.600]   You have nothing to do with him.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.200]   But you notice the balance in the way in which he puts it.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.180]   Well, we've already had the same teaching in the fifth chapter again of this epistle
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:41.080]   to the Ephesians, where he puts it like this, beginning to read at verse 8.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.560]   For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.600]   Walk as the children of light.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:51.360]   But stand proving what is acceptable unto the Lord, and have no fellowship with the
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.280]   unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.360]   For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.840]   Very well, let's have nothing to do with them, let's not even speak about them.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:10.320]   And you remember that terrible warning at the end of the epistle of Jude in the twenty-third
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.320]   verse.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.200]   He's been telling them how to help people of some, he says, have compassion, making
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   a difference.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:23.320]   But here's verse 23, and others, save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.000]   even the garments spotted by the flesh.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.720]   You've got to be very careful.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.600]   You've got to help these people, but be very careful as you're doing so, that they don't
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.760]   drag you down and pollute you.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   People say, Glibly, but our Lord is a friend of publicans and sinners.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.280]   Yes, but never forget that he was the Lord.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:46.160]   Many a man acting on that foolishly and thoughtlessly has just ended in being dragged down to the
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   level of the publican and sinner.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.440]   But if you do it, hating the very garments spotted by the flesh, there will be no danger.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.120]   Very well, avoid bad company.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.720]   Secondly, avoid bad reading.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.120]   And now I mean general reading, polluting reading.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:09.080]   There's a lot of nonsense being talked about this at the present time.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.520]   That Christians must read this kind of filth in order to be able to help people.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520]   Nonsense.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.320]   You needn't wallow in the filth in order to be able to understand something about it
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.560]   and to deal with it.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.640]   There's quite enough teaching about all this in the scriptures.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.200]   You needn't read this literature.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.920]   It's bad.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.200]   It's polluting.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:33.120]   So don't read it, whether it's in the books or whether it's in the newspapers.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.920]   Haven't you found this in your own experience?
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.680]   To read certain things does you harm.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.000]   Don't read them.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.460]   If you find constantly that as a result of reading a certain type of newspaper report
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:53.080]   about divorce or something else, that it subjects you to temptation in a more acute form, well,
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.480]   don't read that sort of thing.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.960]   It's the only thing to do.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.960]   Avoid it.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.960]   Cut it out.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:03.320]   Buy a different type of newspaper, if necessary, that doesn't display all this, that very rightly
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.200]   only gives a few lines to it and says that such and such a verdict was passed.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.760]   You needn't know the details.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.760]   You don't gain anything.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.240]   In fact, you always suffer harm as a result of reading it.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:18.440]   The apostle puts it like this in Romans 13, 14, "Make no provision for the flesh to
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.320]   fulfil the lusts thereof."
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.560]   If you feed the flesh, well, don't be surprised if you fall to its temptations and its lusts.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.400]   Make no provision for it.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.040]   Let's watch our general reading.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:35.760]   Not only that, in the third place under this heading, watch your thoughts and imaginations.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.520]   Flee also youthful lusts.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.160]   That's the point at which to watch.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   The first thought, the first imagination, flee, get away from it, cut it out, stop it.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:55.480]   Thoughts and imaginations thus can be evil, and we are to avoid them, I say, as the very
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.120]   plague.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:02.380]   But let me mention something else, and I do so particularly this morning.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.800]   This is what so many are calling Bible Sunday.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.080]   I don't like these terms.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.280]   Every Sunday is Bible Sunday.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.960]   I think they mean to call attention to the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.960]   perhaps in particular.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.720]   Well, if so, that's all right, but these terms are so foolish.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   Bible Sunday.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.560]   You can't have a Sunday without that Bible.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.840]   The Bible is the centre and the heart of every Sunday.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.880]   But now as they're talking about all this, well, let's look at this matter we are dealing
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.760]   with from that standpoint.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.520]   I'm talking about avoiding diseases and infections.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:46.680]   There's great need of warning about this in connection with the Bible.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.600]   And there's great teaching about this in the Bible itself.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.080]   There are many people talking about Bible Sunday who don't believe in the Bible as the
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   Word of God.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.720]   Avoid them, I say.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.440]   Have nothing to do with them.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.680]   They'll do you harm.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.920]   They'll take from your spiritual energy.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.920]   You'll become diseased.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.760]   Again, how often has this happened?
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:12.040]   How often have we known young men, truly converted, full of passion for souls and zeal and enthusiasm,
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.720]   they go to a theological college and they come out just useless.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   What's happened to them?
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:22.600]   Their faith in the Word of God has been undermined.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.640]   That's disease and infection, and it's to be avoided.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.280]   Look at the harm it does.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.800]   Look at the ruination that it has so often produced.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.880]   Now I'm talking about the whole attitude to the Scriptures.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:40.680]   This teaching that man with his reason is able to say what's right and what's wrong.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.900]   He believes this about the Lord, he doesn't believe that.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.520]   He doesn't believe in his virgin birth.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.960]   He doesn't believe in the miracles.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.840]   He doesn't believe in the literal and physical resurrection.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.580]   That's just fatal.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.520]   This is no longer the Word of God.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.000]   There's no gospel, there's no message.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.320]   And so on, with various other parts.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.440]   Now our attitude to the whole Bible.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:07.000]   I said, have nothing to do with people who don't believe this as the Word of God.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.640]   I'm talking about people who call themselves Christians.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.440]   Of course, you've got to deal with others.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:17.960]   But if a man says he's a Christian and claims to be such, and yet takes out the very basis
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:23.280]   and foundation of the proclamation, have nothing to do with it.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.800]   Now I'm not saying this.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.720]   Let me give you my scriptural warrant for saying this.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.720]   Listen to John in his second epistle.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.880]   This is how he puts it.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.920]   If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house,
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.220]   neither bid him Godspeed.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.980]   We must act on these principles.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:51.880]   It is my duty never to allow a man to occupy this pulpit who has a wrong view of the inspiration
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:57.360]   of Scripture, or who has a wrong view of any one of these cardinal doctrines.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.320]   He's not only not a preacher, I don't want to spend time with him.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   He's of no value to me.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:06.040]   If I can help him, all well and good, but I mustn't welcome him into my house.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.520]   I mustn't be friendly with such a man.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.360]   I must show that there is an essential difference between us.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:19.280]   Now there is nothing, of course, that is so fatal to spiritual vigor and energy and power
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.000]   than this wrong attitude to the Word of God and to these particular doctrines.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.840]   That's why the apostle you see ever wrote the first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.840]   15.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.200]   People were denying the resurrection.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.520]   Why is he concerned about this?
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.720]   He says evil communications corrupt good manners.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.280]   The life will go wrong if the doctrine is wrong.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:47.680]   And I have no hesitation in asserting again that the main cause of the condition of the
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:56.520]   Christian church today is the departure from a belief in the divine inspiration of the
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.680]   Holy Scripture and its final authority in all matters of faith and conduct.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.720]   There's no question about this.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.600]   The Christian church herself, by casting doubt upon the veracity and the truth and the authority
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:15.160]   of the Scripture, has literally sown the seeds of unbelief in the minds of the masses of
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.720]   the people, and they're outside, and they will remain there until we come back to our
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.080]   authority.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:29.600]   It is idle to talk about Bible Sunday unless we believe in the Bible as the Word of God.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.680]   Well, look up the references for yourself.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.440]   There it is, 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.160]   Look at it again in 1 Timothy 6.20.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:43.920]   The apostle says some of these people have swerved away from the truth, and what's the
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   result?
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:51.760]   Well, he says the result is this, that they have made shipwreck of the faith.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:56.760]   Did you notice it there in that great chapter we read at the beginning, 2 Timothy 2, take
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.840]   18 for instance, who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.280]   past already and overthrow the faith of some.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.400]   They've lost it themselves, they're doing harm to others.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.440]   And so spiritual life and energy and vigor have been lost to the church.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:19.560]   Oh, my dear friends, avoid all such teachings as the very plague.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.560]   Develop a sense of discrimination.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.680]   Don't say very nice, very good.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.240]   He talks about Christ, he talks about the death of Christ, but what's he saying about
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.240]   it?
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.920]   What's his teaching concerning it?
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:35.240]   Let's develop a spirit of understanding and discrimination, lest we be carried away by
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:42.400]   these subtle insidious infections which rob us of our spiritual life and vitality.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:49.160]   Oh, I hate having to say things like this, but it is one's duty to avoid people against
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.160]   infections.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.320]   I'm a man who's called upon to put a notice upon the door, "Danger!
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.060]   Stay out!"
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.000]   And avoid such teachings and avoid such men.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.560]   Have no fellowship with them.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.600]   Let me just mention one last thing, which is this.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.880]   It's in our text this morning, here at the end.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:10.760]   The apostle says in verse 13, "Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God, that
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:17.240]   ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all"—to stand, having done
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.240]   all.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   What's he mean?
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.760]   Well, this is it.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.920]   Having done all, he means having fought.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.720]   He's put on the whole armor of God, he's filled with the strength and the power, and
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.240]   he's fought the battle in the evil day.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.280]   Now then, here's the—having done all, here's the danger.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.280]   To take off your armor.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.680]   It's all right, you say, I've had a victory.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.680]   All is well.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.280]   You take off your armor and you lie down on your bed.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.080]   No, says the apostle, having done all.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.240]   Stand!
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.640]   Go on standing.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.200]   Don't relax.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.000]   Maintain the field, as Martin Luther puts it at this point.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Maintain the field.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.040]   You're always on duty in the Christian life.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   You can never relax.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.200]   There's no such thing as a holiday in the spiritual realm.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.560]   Beware of overconfidence, because you've had a great victory.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.560]   You say, I'm all right.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.600]   Put off your armor, put off bits of it, sit down, rest, relax.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   No, no.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.320]   Listen to Paul 1 Corinthians 10, 12.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.400]   "Let him that thinketh, he standeth."
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.680]   Take heed lest he fall.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.180]   Never relax, never give way.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:35.240]   Having done all things, go on standing.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.520]   Maintain the position.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.440]   This is a very terrible danger, this.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.960]   I believe it's one of the dangers at the present time.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.480]   I hear many foolish evangelical people saying, we're winning all along the line, things are
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.480]   going well.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   Are they?
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.320]   Does the state of the church indicate that?
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.920]   Does the state of the world indicate that?
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.480]   No, no.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:00.000]   There's many a man who's been defeated after his greatest victory.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   He foolishly put off the armor and settled down to have a rest and a quiet time, having
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.440]   done all things.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   Go on standing, ever always, beyond the alert and ever ready for this most subtle call.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:24.080]   Well, may God give us grace to apply some of these things to ourselves, indeed to apply
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.080]   them all.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:30.000]   These are the things to avoid, for if you don't, you'll very soon lose your strength.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.680]   You'll become limp and weak.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:39.440]   Even as a man like Samson did, when he fell into some of the pitfalls and the traps that
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:45.400]   I've been indicating to you, he lost his strength, you remember, because he wasn't sufficiently
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.680]   careful as to the company which he kept.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.120]   May God preserve us.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.120]   May God give us grace and wisdom to apply these things.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:01.240]   Now shall we join in singing our closing hymn, hymn number 442.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.240]   442.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:10.280]   Come thou fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing thy grace.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   442.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:40.280]   Come thou fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing thy grace.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.280]   442.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   Come thou fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing thy grace.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   442.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   Come thou fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing thy grace.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:48:03.640]   Oh Lord, hear our prayer and seal our hearts with thy blessed spirit.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:11.680]   And now, unto him that is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:20.120]   the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:26.280]   and majesty, dominion and power both now and ever.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:32.680]   And may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:40.160]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.520]   of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:51.600]   And until we shall be ever with him in the glory everlasting.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.120]   Amen.
