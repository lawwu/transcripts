[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]   Look at Freiburg. He's like, this is so awkward. I can't wait.
[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.720]   You literally brought popcorn, didn't you?
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720]   I'm just watching the show.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.180]   You brought popcorn. He's like, I want to see round three.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.120]   I have nothing to say today. I'm just going to sit here and watch.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.300]   I brought popcorn.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.800]   I got my chili roasted pistachio nuts. I'm going to sit back and enjoy the J. Cal Sacks.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   Are we really going to do this as the top story?
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.900]   I mean, this is the third time we've tried to do this story.
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.960]   Do we give the background sacks or no?
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.520]   We wouldn't have had to do it over and over again if you didn't act so hysterical.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.480]   There we go.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.740]   The first one you killed.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.200]   No, you killed it.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.100]   No, the first one you killed.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.740]   Yeah, because it wasn't even on the docket and it wasn't even newsworthy.
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.960]   Okay. And the second one I killed.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.360]   Because you came across like a stark raving lunatic.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.900]   I spiked it the second time because I was so infuriated by your cavalier attitude towards it.
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.480]   What are you worried about my attitude for?
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.580]   Why don't you just focus on making your own good points?
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.040]   Here's the thing.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.300]   I was so correct.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.200]   I was so correct.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.080]   The two of you.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.820]   Let him go.
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.640]   Let him go.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.200]   You guys got popcorn.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.240]   Let's hear this idiot try to blame his own hysteria on me.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.340]   You said that January 6th was overblown.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.520]   And of course.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.200]   No, I said it was a disgrace.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.860]   I said it was an embarrassment.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.520]   It was an embarrassment to the country.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.420]   I said it was wrong.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.440]   But you want to inflate it.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.100]   You're engaging in classic Washington threat inflation.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.720]   Nope.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.060]   And there's two problems with that.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.060]   One is you're going to take your eye off the ball of the real issues facing the country.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:59.580]   Like inflation, the economy and economic anxiety like COVID, like crime, like schools.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.640]   I mean, these are the issues that Americans care about.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.240]   Not, you know, a riot that happened over a year ago.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.340]   And if you and the Democrats keep talking about this and focus on it on MSNBC to the exclusion of the issues that really matter.
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.040]   I'll see you in November because you're gonna get slaughtered in this midterm election is going to be a landslide.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.720]   But the other problem with it is with this threat inflation is that it justifies.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:35.360]   The expansion of surveillance powers and prosecutorial powers by the Justice Department by the, you know, by the by the Justice Department, other branch of our government who want to basically go after, you know, this, the so called domestic terrorism.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.420]   That will lead to an infringement on civil liberties, just like the expansion of those agencies did after 911.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.560]   And so I think we should all be like concerned about it.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.180]   Now, look, are these Oath Keepers a bunch of idiots?
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.320]   Yeah, there were 11 Oath Keepers at that rally.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.720]   They broke into the wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, you're saying an old fat guy with an eye patch.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.120]   And that says, Oath Keeper lifetime member is not credible to you.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.160]   Exactly.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:18.580]   I mean, look, this is these guys are either they're not unlike the Antifa, right, you know, people in Portland who are trying to burn down buildings or, or chase a Boudin's parents who are domestic terrorists.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.220]   I mean, yeah, this is a small.
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.980]   Number of knuckleheads who broke into the Capitol, they should be prosecuted.
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.720]   They're, they're guilty of saying this leader is saying intemperate things.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.280]   But was this gonna be a coup to take over the Capitol?
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.480]   I don't I don't think so.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.460]   Okay, let me focus on that to the exclusion of the real issues facing the country.
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.060]   Like I said, this landslide November, this red waves can be even bigger,
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.520]   just to your point about my focus every week here on the number one tech podcasts in the world and on the number six tech podcasts in the world this week in startups.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.420]   I focus on all of those issues.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.180]   But let's read because we can chew gum and walk at the same time.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:09.920]   Let's read what happened on Thursday, the FBI arrested 11 members of the Oath Keepers on sedition charges and the House Committee subpoenaed Facebook, Google, Reddit and Twitter after insufficient responses to the January six riots or insurrection, whichever term you prefer.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:18.720]   The leader of the Oath Keepers, which is an organization that claims over 30,000 members primarily in the military and police.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.140]   Okay, well, hold on a second.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.380]   If this was their big moment to stage a coup and take over the government, why were only 11 of the 30,000 there?
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.800]   The 11 were indicted, David, there were many were there?
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.140]   Well, we don't know yet.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.800]   But last week, you said, last week, you said there was no coordinated attack.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.740]   And now we have proof.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.180]   No, that's not what I said.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.500]   That you look, you, you can't veto the segment from last week, and then try to claim that I said,
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.580]   sir, let me just fit it.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.600]   Can I get through the story?
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.580]   Or you keep interrupting?
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.040]   My God, okay, from the
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.800]   complaining about interruption.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.900]   Okay, that's another
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.360]   interruption.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.800]   May I finish it without before interruption?
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.040]   Or would you like to just keep monologuing?
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.960]   What are you reading?
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.100]   Once you just give us the
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   remember every week,
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.360]   get the actual story.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.000]   That's what I'm trying to do.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.700]   But you keep interrupting.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.200]   So here we go.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.500]   While certain Oath Keeper members and affiliates inside Washington, DC breached the Capitol grounds and buildings.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.860]   Others remain stationed just outside the city in QRF teams.
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.240]   These are quick response teams that had weapons and they transported firearms into Washington, DC.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:30.660]   In and these in support operations were aimed at using force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power, according to our Department of Justice, which is majority Republican, obviously law enforcement skews.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.000]   No, it's not.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.500]   Republican.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.500]   Are you kidding me?
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.400]   A portion of the Oath Keepers communication occurred on Signal.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.200]   You think the FBI is pro-Republican?
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.460]   Are you going to keep interrupting me?
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.300]   Oh my God, can I just read two sentences, Dave?
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.600]   Get a taste of your own medicine, pal.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.200]   Okay, fine.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.800]   Signal is an encrypted chat app that's not supposed to have any back doors, but obviously there are some planned.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.840]   Here are some of Rhodes's comments.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.720]   We aren't getting through this without a civil war.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.500]   Too late for that.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.860]   Prepare your mind, body and spirit.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.060]   It will be a bloody and desperate fight.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.200]   We're going to have to fight.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.100]   This cannot be avoided.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.600]   If we want to make the January 6th of relevant.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.000]   First of all, let me just say I see that primarily as a media story.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.200]   What happened happened.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.020]   Obviously it was a disgrace and embarrassment of black eye for the country.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.220]   I'm not supporting or defending anyone.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.560]   I tend to think these Oath Keepers, it was not like a super organized concerted effort to take over the government.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   It's somewhere.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.060]   It's basically a bunch of loudmouths who you're engaged in a riot.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.560]   Maybe there was more planning and preparation.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.060]   Fine.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.960]   The court case will bear it out.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.060]   And if they can prove that it was what you said, it was great.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.760]   Let him go to jail.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.960]   I have no desire to defend them.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.760]   But I also think then the grand scheme of things, this whole thing's been blown completely out proportion.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.160]   If you watch MSNBC, it's all January 6th all the time.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.260]   And, you know, if Democrats are going to focus on this issue for the next 10 months and you know who Roger Stone was for.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.260]   Roger Stone was photographed on a sidewalk with, which was the big story the other day.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.760]   This red wave in November is going to be an even bigger wave.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.860]   I'm just telling you right now because it's not what the average voter in the country cares about.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.060]   I think you're right about that.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.960]   I think you're right about that.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.760]   I'll agree with that.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.560]   I think, you know, MSNBC is focused on this and Fox is focused on fake voter fraud.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:12.160]   And we've been pretty clear here that none of us agree with either of the extremes of media coverage.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.960]   I do think this is an issue worth resolving quickly.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.260]   What fake voter fraud are you talking about?
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.960]   The guy who's upset.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.060]   Right now with voter fraud is Biden.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:28.460]   He just gave a speech, a very intemperate speech saying that if you don't support his new voting rights acts that you're on the side of Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.060]   There was some political calculus there.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.560]   He had to do that because he was also trying to basically bolster the ability to get this, you know, filibuster thing passed in the Senate.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   So he he basically had to play a relatively weak hand.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.660]   And you know, again on what happened again legislatively is that his own party said no enough.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.360]   In this case, it was Kristen Sinema who basically said no, none of this.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.560]   Right.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.960]   Well, Sinema and Manchin won't support amending the filibuster.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.760]   So this thing was DOA.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.460]   We said it was a DOA when the Build Back Better bill collapsed.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.660]   We said they were going to try and pivot to voting rights to change the subject, even though it was DOA.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:09.460]   But there is something that Biden could do or could have done that I think would be a bipartisan reform, which is to reform the Electoral Count Act.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:16.360]   I mean, what happened in November, if you're concerned about Trump and, you know, this version of the potential to subvert the election.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.660]   And the way he tried to influence pens to stop the counting of the electors.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:27.160]   If you're concerned about all of that, there is a fix for that, which is the Electoral Count Act of 1887.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.460]   It's completely antiquated.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.560]   Obviously, it's been around for over a hundred years.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.460]   There is bipartisan support for fixing that.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.260]   The Wall Street Journal editorial page has come out for months.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.560]   Explain what that is to the audience.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:46.060]   Well, it's just a it's just a it's a law that that governs how these electors in the Electoral College get counted up and certified so that, you know, the election gets.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:54.160]   So, David Brooks had that piece that that Jamal shared in the New York Times, which is the problem we have right now is not in the actual voting.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:01.360]   It's in the if you're worried about what happened in this past November, it's in the certification, not the voting.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:15.760]   And, you know, what Brooks was writing about is there's a lot of social science saying that, you know, a lot of these rules that Democrats and Republicans are really focused on around the convenience of the election don't really influence the number of people who vote.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   People who vote want people who want to vote, vote.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.460]   People who don't don't.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.960]   You know, we're getting hung up on the wrong thing, which is, you know, these voter ID laws.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.360]   What really matters is the certification of the Electoral College.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:44.060]   And you could find Biden could find I think there's a number of Republicans who would support a clarification of that law and updating of it so that what potentially could have happened in, you know, in January, if Pence had gone along with this plan to basically reject the accounting of the electors.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.460]   I mean, everyone understood.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.160]   What do you think?
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.460]   That was just ceremonial, right?
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:47.960]   That was not.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.060]   What do you think of that plan?
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.260]   What did you think of Trump's plan?
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.960]   I think that Trump had a right to air his grievances in court.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:01.760]   But once the court threw out his claims and rejected them, and once the Supreme Court denied certiorari, it was over.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.560]   It was over.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.260]   The Supreme Court has the final word in our democracy about legal matters.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:15.160]   And so, no, Pence never had the authority or the ability under the Electoral Count Act to reject the counting of the electors.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160]   And so, you know, the whole process is ceremonial.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.160]   But the mere fact that this isn't even an issue suggests that we should fix it.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.660]   We should go back and fix the Electoral Count Act of 1887.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.660]   So, look, Biden could have gotten 60 votes for that.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.460]   You know, I think that was very doable.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.760]   He can get votes for that.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.160]   He can also get votes to stop the insider trading of members of Congress.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.460]   He could get that done, too.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.860]   So why isn't he focused on things where he can actually get a bipartisan majority?
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:51.160]   Because one big legislative success as president has been the infrastructure bill where he got a bunch of Republican support.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.660]   Which is a pretty big win, yeah.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.060]   Those are the types of issues he should be focused on.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:03.660]   And instead, he's giving these, you know, speeches saying that anyone who disagrees with the progressive agenda on voting rights is basically George Wallace or Bull Connor.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.160]   Did you guys hear his speech the other day on CNBC about COVID?
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.060]   I mean, he was so incoherent, it was kind of scary.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.560]   It feels like he's in cognitive...
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   The cognitive decline is...
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.060]   You know, I voted for the guy.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.060]   Anything to get Trump out of office, I thought that was an existential risk.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.560]   But man, he is cognitively declining quickly.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.960]   I mean, I think the craziest thing about COVID was this Rachel Walensky interview.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.760]   I mean, like, why does it take two years into a pandemic to tell us what we kind of anecdotally knew?
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.860]   But if we had known upfront or sooner, we would have completely...
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.260]   Explain this.
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.160]   Rachel Walensky does an interview.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.260]   She's the head of the CDC.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:44.260]   And she said, well, it turns out that 75% of all the deaths because of COVID were people that suffered from at least...
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:44.760]   Four.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   Four comorbidities.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.260]   Four.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:46.760]   At least four.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   Not three, not two, not one.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.260]   I saw that.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:48.760]   I almost fell out of my chair.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.260]   Not one.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.260]   Four.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:50.760]   It wasn't all.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.260]   It was...
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.760]   I think it was a subset defined by...
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.260]   It might have been like vaccinated deaths or something like that.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.260]   It was one study.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.760]   But yes, that was basically the conclusion.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   Absolutely.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   It's significant comorbidities among people who died.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.260]   And so, if we had known that, don't you think...
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.760]   I mean, Friedberg, you tell me, but wouldn't we have just changed our response to just mask
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.260]   and just kind of like start living our normal lives and people with four comorbidities or people at a certain age...
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:13.560]   Stay home.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.960]   ...or immunocompromised?
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   Should have stayed home.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.460]   And we would be in a very different situation.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.460]   So, you know, I mean, I understand, Jason, that Biden didn't...
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.460]   The last few speeches have been a little tight.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.460]   You know, I mean, I think, look, the Quinnipiac poll, then, Nick, you can post it.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.460]   I mean, look, his ratings are just...
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.460]   Plummeting.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.460]   Plummeting.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.460]   I mean, it's down to Trump levels, right?
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.460]   Every week.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.960]   And so, he is definitely searching for a handful of wins.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.460]   I don't think he strategically found the right ones.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.660]   He could have done something.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.360]   He could have done something on certifying the electoral college.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   He could certainly do something right now on insider trading laws for members of Congress.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   But instead, we're focusing on all these random things.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.160]   But anyway, sorry.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.760]   He can't get the insider trading thing past Pelosi.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.160]   But yeah, I think it is something that would get a huge bipartisan majority.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.260]   Look, she's going to lose anyway, so he might as well just throw under the bus.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:07.960]   You're right.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   This is about his political salvation over hers.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.260]   By the way, you guys saw this.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.360]   I mentioned this in the group chat.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.160]   Someone floated the trial balloon of dumping Kamala Harris and replacing her with Liz Cheney.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.760]   This is how bad things have gotten for the Democrats.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.060]   Well, I mean, we were having a...
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.560]   They floated a trial balloon of Biden Cheney in '24.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.060]   A crossover ticket.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.460]   We talked about this for a couple of years in private and poker.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.860]   I think a crossover ticket is what the country needs to kind of get back to center.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.060]   And I know it's a crazy concept and it's a 1% chance, but I kind of like the crossover.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.060]   But things have gotten so bad for the Democrats now that...
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.360]   I sort of said Sacks floated this or pre-floated it.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.560]   We had a little debate on the Twitter.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.360]   But I don't know if you remember two or three episodes ago, Sacks said, "Hey, listen, there's going to be a new appreciation for Clinton."
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   And not 10 days later, the Wall Street Journal and a bunch of people are floating Hillary coming back to run.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.560]   Well, I said Bill Clinton.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.460]   I didn't mention Hillary.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.060]   I know that.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:12.760]   But I think either you are in your star chamber and doing a pre-float on all ends, so then the backups can then, you know,
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.760]   pump Hillary as that, or it's just people are listening to you and you're that influential.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   What I'm proposing is that Biden engage in Clintonian, by which I mean Bill Clinton-tonian, triangulation,
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.260]   which is he does not have the votes in Congress to enact a progressive agenda.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260]   He should be looking for bipartisan wins.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.760]   He did with the infrastructure bill.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.560]   He could do with this insider trading thing.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.360]   He could do it on the Electoral Count Act.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.460]   These are things that would be, you know, progress.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:40.860]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.760]   China policy.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.460]   And importantly, momentum.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.460]   Momentum going into 2024.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.860]   And maybe good for Americans.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:53.060]   Like, I mean, his China policy, the fact that he came out with a statement on the Uyghurs, I thought was very strong.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.160]   You know, it's one of the stronger things he did, but it's not coming up in the polls.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.260]   And I think that whole Republicans interested in getting Hillary to run again is a setback.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.360]   Nobody cares about what's happening to the Uyghurs, okay?
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.260]   You bring it up because you really care.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:04.260]   What?
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:04.760]   And I think that's nice that you care.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.060]   What do you mean nobody cares?
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.360]   The rest of us don't care.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.160]   I'm just telling you a very hard...
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.660]   Wait, you're saying you personally don't care?
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.160]   I'm telling you a very hard, ugly truth.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:12.660]   Okay?
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.160]   Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.660]   Okay?
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.860]   Of all the things that I care about, it is below my line.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.360]   Disappointing.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:26.160]   Well, I think people, if you explain to them what's happening to the Uyghurs in China, they care, but it's not top of mind for them.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:26.860]   That's not caring.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.160]   What's top of mind right now is they go to the grocery store and the shelves are empty.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:30.660]   Sure.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.760]   That I care about.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:36.860]   I care about the fact that our economy could turn on a dime if China invades Taiwan.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.160]   I care about that.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.860]   I care about climate change.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.060]   You know, I care about a bunch of...
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.860]   I care about America.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.360]   I care about America's crippling and decrepit healthcare infrastructure.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.560]   But if you're asking me, do I care about a segment of a class of people in another country?
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.060]   Not until we can take care of ourselves will I prioritize them over us.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:04.360]   And I think a lot of people believe that, and I'm sorry if that's a hard truth to hear, but every time I say that I care about the Uyghurs, I'm really just lying if I don't really care.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.160]   And so I'd rather not lie to you and tell you the truth.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.360]   It's not a priority for me.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.560]   And my response to that is I think it's a sad state of affairs when human rights as a
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:18.860]   concept globally falls beneath tactical and strategic issues that we have to have.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.860]   We need to have a high watermark.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.060]   That's another luxury belief.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.260]   I don't believe believing in the human declaration of human rights that Eleanor Roosevelt created
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.260]   with the United Nations.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.160]   I don't think it's a luxury belief to believe that all humans should have a basic set of
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.860]   human rights.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.360]   I think it's a luxury belief.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:32.860]   Far from it.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.060]   And the reason I think it's a luxury belief is we don't do enough domestically to actually
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.560]   express that view in real tangible ways.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.260]   So until we actually clean up our own house,
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.060]   the idea that we step outside of our borders with,
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.560]   you know,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:50.860]   with us sort of like morally virtue signaling about somebody else's human rights track record
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.460]   is deplorable.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.060]   Look at the number of black and brown men that are in car.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:54.960]   Far from deplorable.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.760]   Look at the number of black and brown men that are incarcerated for absolutely ridiculous crimes.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.460]   I don't know if you saw this past week,
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:07.360]   but there is a person that was released from jail because he couldn't even be protected in jail because in some of these cells,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.960]   they run these fight clubs inside of Rikers Island that are basically
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.160]   tacitly endorsed by the corrections officers that don't do anything.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.960]   And the difference.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   So hold on Jason.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.660]   So if you want to talk about the human rights of people,
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.360]   I think we have a responsibility to take care of our own backyard first.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.460]   First.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:32.160]   And then we can go and basically morally tell other people how they should be running their own countries.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:40.760]   The difference is Chamath saying what you just said in China or Saudi Arabia would put you in jail and get you a hundred lashes and you would be tortured for a decade.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.860]   We here in the United States are far from perfect.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.860]   We still have the death penalty,
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.760]   which is against the United Declaration of Human Rights,
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.360]   which we signed,
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.860]   which Eleanor Roosevelt created in the UN and we propagated as Americans around the world.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:18:08.160]   We started that Chamath and we can have these discussions about being better in this country and the what about ism that you're proposing is so disproportional to the equivalent of the Holocaust going on.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.660]   We're talking about a million Uyghurs in concentration camps right now.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:19.860]   To talk about what we have here that we need to fix and compare it to that or to Saudi Arabia whipping bloggers and throwing gay people off roofs for being gay.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.660]   The these two things are not morally comparable.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:30.460]   They are very far and we need to have open discussions and talk about human rights all the time because if we do not talk about it all the time,
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.960]   then your position,
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.460]   which is I don't have time for that.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:39.260]   I want to solve my problems then gives the green light to dictators everywhere that nobody's watching.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:39.860]   That's not true.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.560]   Vigilance.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.060]   And that and that's what I find and I think we need to hold on a second position.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.860]   That's not what I said and that's not true.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.360]   You said you can't get up for it.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.660]   So tell me how problem are you?
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:56.760]   So are you saying that the situation with the Uyghurs is the same as the Holocaust people who are Jewish are making that comparison.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.660]   You never know.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.160]   I'm asking you.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.360]   I think it is comparable.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.860]   There are upwards of a million people in a concentration camp right now.
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.060]   This is getting to numbers that are actually comparable.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.360]   It is actually a valid comparison saying there are a million people in a.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.560]   Concentration camp.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:26.760]   That is the numbers that human rights organizations are saying between 300,000 and a million people are incarcerated right now being tortured raped and in doing forced sterilization re-education and when they're released are being tracked in ghettos.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.960]   And so you people are bringing this up.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.460]   Hold on.
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.960]   Are you saying the entire you're saying the entire world is basically decided that that doesn't matter.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.160]   You just said you can't get up for it.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.360]   I'm talking about you specifically.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   But who is getting up?
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.660]   Well, who is getting up for it?
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.360]   I am very up on.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.060]   And I talk about it all the time every week.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.160]   What about the US government?
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.160]   What are they doing about it?
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:51.660]   The Biden just said we are going to do a ban and we are going to sanction companies that do business in that region.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.060]   So Apple and and Tesla.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:59.560]   I think there will be increased pressure on all companies that are engaging in China over.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.260]   It's right.
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.660]   It's goods that are sourced from those areas, right?
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.060]   Correct.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.060]   Yes, it's not doing business there.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.260]   It's it's it's if your supply chain comes from that area.
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:08.560]   Right.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.260]   And it's a first.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.260]   It's a kind of like we.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.360]   Won't we won't buy Nazi goods, but we're we'll sell our iPhones into Nazi Germany.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.960]   Well, if you want to have a discussion about this, you know, it's how do we disengage from China?
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.060]   We've had this discussion here.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:29.260]   How what amount of time will it take to disengage from countries that have brutal dictatorships that are committing human rights atrocities?
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:35.860]   My look at look, I think I'm spending a lot of time and money actually trying to fortify America's supply chain.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.760]   You guys know about some of the things that I'm doing.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.060]   I'm not.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.160]   I'm not doing that from a moral.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.660]   Perspective.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.060]   I'm doing that from a practical capitalist perspective.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.260]   I think the jobs are better served for Americans.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:21:01.160]   And I think that we should have the ability to build our own businesses just like China has the right to do for themselves without the risk of these things being undercut by policies that we don't understand, which is effectively what you do when you outsource your supply chain to countries where you're not a hundred percent aligned with them.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   Yeah, and their dictatorships.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:10.060]   So I again, I'm not I'm not even sure that that it is China is a dictatorship the way that you want to call it that.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.860]   Again, I think I'm in a country that's in the name.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.160]   Look, you have to understand Jason.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.160]   There are a set of checks and balances here on China that, you know, at the end of the day.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.960]   I don't think that I have the moral absolutism to judge China.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.860]   And I would say that when NATO is silent, the United Nations is silent.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:36.360]   All of Western Europe is silent and America is effectively silent that this issue may be small data points being extrapolated in a way to create a narrative that maybe not be true.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.960]   And if it is true, Jason, there is a responsibility for those body politicians.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:45.660]   To do something because that is the early warning signal that the rest of the world uses to say, okay, hold on.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.260]   Let me reprioritize my list of things.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:22:03.560]   So I guess what I'm saying is I am not going to be an armchair journalist on this topic nor am I going to be the armchair human rights advocate for the world because I just don't know I can focus on the things that I know about build the things that I know about and if something really does get red light status.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.360]   Then other parties will do something.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.860]   And again, I just want to be clear NATO is silent.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.560]   United Nations is silent.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.660]   America is silent.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.560]   A press release doesn't change the actual technical posture on these topics.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   Okay, if that if your position is that human rights matters to you, if government large government organizations or politicians give you the green light to care about it.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:25.960]   That's fine.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.160]   I care about it intrinsically every day.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.560]   Great.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.660]   I'm fine with you doing that.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.760]   I thought there was a segue there.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.260]   Talk about the Ray Dalio thing that freeberg cares about.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:39.560]   I mean, this is I mean this debate that you're having between kind of realism and idealism.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.360]   And foreign policy is sort of what Dalio tackles right for your bird.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.860]   Look, I mean, it sounds to me like there's let's just say a red herring.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:57.860]   There always needs to be a chamath points out a narrative on framing our enemy when you know, you're running out of land.
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:09.460]   I mean you guys saw this was it a journal article or New York Times article that came out today that US intelligence revealed that Putin had actually put some actors.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:17.260]   Into the eastern Ukraine to set up for a reason to have a response and therefore an excuse to invade the Ukraine.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.660]   So he was trying to create a bit of a fireworks show to give him an excuse.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:39.260]   We always need a narrative that we can sell to our you know, our citizens and so, you know, there's not going to be a lot of you know, patting on the back of China right now as we've talked about there is this, you know, overarching multi hundred year.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:47.860]   Economic cycle, you know, call it geopolitical cycle that the United States and China are about to clash on and in order for them to clash effectively.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.260]   We need to get the narrative right, which is to paint them as the bad guy and to make things evil.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:24:08.960]   And look, I mean you may take your ethical framework and say that they are bad and you may be able to take other parts of your ethical framework and looking at objectively call some countries that you consider good that as well, depending on what story you want to tell yourself and what story you want to be told and I think that's what's going on and will continue to go on for a long time.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.460]   For a long period of time and this this weaker thing is as Jamal pointed out.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.060]   How do you measure on an absolute basis human rights?
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:25.560]   I don't think that there's a way to do so whether it's one person getting tortured publicly in a street or a hundred thousand people being suppressed economically and not being able to get jobs.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.260]   It's hard to say what is appropriate.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.060]   What is not what is evil?
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.760]   What is not at the end of the day?
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.160]   We create narratives and that narrative allows the bigger picture to kind of play itself out.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.660]   And I think that's what's going on largely.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:53.960]   And I don't think we're going to hear a lot of good news about China for the next decade from any politician in the United States or anyone that wants to defend our political and economic interests globally, which are certainly being challenged by China right now.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.460]   I don't know.
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.860]   That's my diatribe about the Dalio.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:02.760]   Look at Dalio obviously does a great job of kind of simplifying and eloquently stating what's going on.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.460]   But I think this is one of many many manifestations of it.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.360]   You need only read what the UN Amnesty International.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.360]   Human Rights Watch the Guardian the New York Times, you know, this is not up for question.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.760]   Why do you think you're so wound up about this and you're not wound up about what's going on in Somalia?
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:23.160]   Oh, no, I you're not wound up about what's going on in Saudi Arabia or you're not or you're not wound up about hold on.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:23.460]   Hold on.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.660]   What's going on in Eastern Ukraine?
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.560]   Hold on a second.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   There are human rights violations all over the world.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:35.460]   I comment on on them and I have commented on them for decades since I worked at Amnesty International Amnesty International, which is where I started my career.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.060]   I've been passionate about this since the age of 18 or 19.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:43.360]   When I worked at Amnesty International, you said that you cannot grade these things, right?
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.760]   You just said like it's hard to compare these things and this is a problem like you can actually do that.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.260]   There are human rights violations like freedom of speech, which you know is a great aspiration,
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:03.360]   but we would say torture murder systematic rape and sterilization are more intense and horrific than just freedom of speech.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.760]   So if you look at Hong Kong when they shut down Apple News, that's one level of human rights.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.660]   Right people have lost their ability.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.860]   But you're telling stories hundreds of this are not stories.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.360]   These are facts. Apple News was shut down.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:23.160]   You were telling a fact about a particular a particular set of experiences that are particularly harming a set of people.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:37.060]   Let me give you another fact in the United States where we have a population of let's be generous and say 400 million people 2.3 million or 40 million 340 million Americans 2.3 million of whom are incarcerated.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:37.460]   Absolutely.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:44.160]   In China with a population of 1.4 billion 1.7 million Chinese are incarcerated.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.460]   Absolutely something we have to do.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.760]   Where is human rights being violated on an absolute basis?
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:54.060]   It's a very difficult conversation to use facts and figures because at the end of the day,
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.460]   there's a lot of data that can be pointed the other way.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.460]   And so it all comes down to narratives and that narrative always has an objective,
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.860]   which is what are you trying to get people to believe and what are you trying to get them to get behind and get to do?
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.160]   Yes. And what are you trying to justify? Yes.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.260]   And the action free work.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.960]   They don't have a drug problem over there because they killed all the drug dealers.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.460]   Mal put him up against the wall and shot him.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.260]   So, you know, they just send their fentanyl here.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.760]   That's fair enough, but I'm just saying like look and it's a very good point,
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.860]   which is you can actually take the data and you can slice it and tell different stories around it.
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:30.560]   But at the end of the day, it's very hard to say there's good and there's evil that we have to go and attack and that is what is going ever said attack.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   I never said attack. I didn't say invade China over this and I didn't say invade Saudi Arabia.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.860]   I think we should talk about the temperature. Raise the temperature.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.160]   No, I did not say that either.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.760]   If you want to know what I think should happen.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.660]   Put political pressure on them, right?
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:53.960]   I think when people are involved in torture, murder, rape, and sterilizing people that there should be economic and disengagement that occurs as a first step.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   And that that is why when people in our circles in venture capital take money from somebody who murdered a journalist,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.560]   Mohammed bin Salim, MBS from Saudi Arabia, we should disengage from a country like that.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.860]   I believe that that is what we should do.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.460]   And I believe people like us.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:18.260]   I believe people like us who are capital allocators and creators and who are influencers should be talking about human rights all the time.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:25.860]   And we should be familiar with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and we should read what's in it and we should aspire to hit those notes in our country and everywhere else.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.460]   And this me too ism.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:36.260]   I'm sorry this, you know equivalency problem that you guys keep bringing up that is a trap that is an intellectual trap because there is no equivalent.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:48.960]   See from putting a detaining a million people putting hundreds of thousands of them and torturing them to what's happening in the United States where we wrote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and where we can have conversations about it.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.460]   If you try to have the conversation we are going to disagree with you.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.760]   We would all be tortured in Saudi Arabia.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.960]   We would all be tortured and detained inside of China.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   I just think that there's a very dangerous thing that you're doing which is you are ranking and which is essentially assigning some sort of let's just call it.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:13.160]   Economic value to those things that you just just described torture rape for sterilization.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   But I think then you're ignoring.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.260]   How do you actually economically rank systemic racism in the United States?
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.460]   What happens in our inner school system inner city school system?
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.460]   What happens to black and brown men?
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.360]   What happens to the families of those people?
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.560]   What happens to how the lobbies basically break down the healthcare system?
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.660]   All I'm saying is Jason if you take your argument to the extreme.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:43.660]   You start to get into all these areas of gray where it's impossible to assign economic realities to those things so that you can actually rank and rate.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.160]   That's why I do think that.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.960]   Yeah, because what you're going to we're talking about your numerically ranking these things.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.660]   No, no, I never use a numeric.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.760]   I'm just saying one is proportionally different.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.160]   Sure. I'm not putting economic.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.360]   I never use term a proportion.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   Those really bad things happen 10 times and these kind of bad things happen 10,000 times.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.160]   Which one's worse?
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.360]   I think if you asked anybody who is in a.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.960]   Uyghur prison being sterilized torture.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.660]   I'm asking you if they would rather be.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.060]   Yes.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.260]   I mean you could do this test Jason.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:17.060]   I'm asking you a question if 10 people 10 Uyghurs were raped or forced sterilized.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.160]   Yes versus 10 million black man falsely incarcerated.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.660]   Which one is worse?
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.660]   Yeah, this is not the way to do the calculus.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.260]   You could do it on an individual basis.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:35.060]   You can look at an individual inside of a prison being tortured and an individual living in the United States every single person who is inside of that torture chamber.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.460]   Being raped being sterilized would say I would absolutely love to come to America.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:43.760]   That's why everybody wants to come to this country and live in a free democracy where they can speak freely.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:51.360]   They can practice whatever religion they want and not be tortured and what you're doing by adding up all the tiny pain and suffering that we have here in America and then,
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.760]   you know, trying to conflate that with these horrific acts.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.960]   You have to look at exactly how horrific these are on an individual basis.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.160]   Just like we did with George Floyd.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.660]   We see George Floyd happen.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.760]   That is something that is absolutely.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.860]   Worth being outraged about at a higher level, right?
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.360]   You have to stop for a second and say, oh my God, this has to be resolved.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.760]   We can do these two things at the same time.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.560]   We can refine our education system.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.460]   No George Floyd.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.460]   George Floyd actually being the Uyghurs being sterilized.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:27.360]   I think George Floyd proves my point because there's been innumerable number of black men that have been murdered with nary a thing that's ever happened in the United States.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:34.460]   But had happened in an exact moment where the sum of all of these other things that happened before had just.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:40.960]   Compounded to a point where the whole thing spilled over and enough people decided to basically say the sum total of this damage.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.360]   Now is the equivalent of a very meaningful human rights violation.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:53.960]   You can work on both these things at the same time is my point and this and this you're basically giving a pass by kind of conflating these two things in my mind.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.260]   You can work on both these issues.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:03.460]   You could want to stop abhorrent torture and murder and rape while wanting to make our justice system better while wanting to make our education system better.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.160]   You don't have to pick one.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.860]   Chum off.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.060]   I think you do actually.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.460]   No, you do not.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.460]   We could absolutely create nothing.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.960]   I can do about the Uyghurs in China.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.260]   Zero.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:12.460]   Absolutely.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.960]   There is you could not capital allocate to regions or to companies that are engaged.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.160]   I don't I don't have any shing shanese.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.060]   Okay, perfect.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.960]   And if you do see one, you could do that and you could also speak up because they can't get out of China.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.860]   What are you talking about?
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.260]   Do you take money from Saudi Arabia?
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.560]   No, I think I don't have any more.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.260]   And did you make a moral decision about that?
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:31.760]   No.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.860]   Okay, if you did get offered a billion dollars.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.860]   Would you take it from them?
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:40.260]   And by the way, to be honest, there's a bunch of my companies that have been supported by folks who have taken money from them.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:44.660]   And I know that's a problem when I look what well, what's the bigger problem?
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:51.960]   Is it that the solution that these guys are that they're designing for mental health or diabetes or you know, housing or whatever it is.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:57.160]   This startup does when they take money from SoftBank or whoever all of a sudden they should be canceled and not be able to do that.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:57.760]   I didn't say cancel.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.060]   Just take the money from somebody different.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.860]   Nobody said canceled where I don't know.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.560]   Co2 pick another firm.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.060]   Goldman.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.260]   I don't know who it doesn't take Saudi.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:15.560]   So should you should the United States create a program where whenever you get a way you ever get a term sheet from SoftBank or anybody with money from didn't say that if you should just be able to go and redeem it for some somebody else's money.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.360]   I never said that either.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.660]   I think each individual a capital allocated like yourself and a CEO should make what they believe is a morally right decision.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.860]   Well, they voted and they don't care about this issue.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:30.560]   They're voting with their dollars every day that people should care about human rights and they should care about who they make money for.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.060]   I know I'm a lone voice.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.060]   I know I'm a lone voice.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.860]   But I believe you should care about.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.560]   No, no, no, I'm not saying Jason.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.060]   I'm just saying something very subtle.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.460]   I'm not saying that what you believe is wrong.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.960]   In fact, I think it's beautiful and wholeheartedly right.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:53.460]   What I'm saying is when everybody else tries to nod their head and agree with you in the moment, they're just moral leave virtue signaling in a luxury belief that they themselves don't exhibit.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:34:02.260]   They don't make any changes towards and it's largely because they don't believe that this is an issue and I'm just putting it on the table as it just is true based on everybody's behavior.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:02.960]   Maybe other than you.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.060]   I agree with you.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.060]   But everybody else is voting.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.460]   I would like to change everybody's behavior.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.560]   And I think you can offer your opinion and maybe you will change some people's minds.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:16.260]   I'm sure there are some people listening here and I know there are some founders who would not take money from SoftBank and would not take money from Saudi Arabia.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.160]   And I know there are some capital allocators who will not take money from dictatorships.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:32.660]   I think that you're also forgetting that there's there has been as it seems again from very very far away looking in a lot of things that they have been able to do that is really constructive, you know, they've actually created.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.360]   Some pretty decent ties to Israel.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.860]   They've actually started to create a path to normalize like normalized relations in the Middle East.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:48.760]   You know, they've organized against what could be the real threat there, which is, you know, a nuclear empowered Iran.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   So just to put things in perspective, Jason, it's kind of like you have to look at the totality of the situation again in the United States today.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:02.360]   If you just looked at that one simple thing, you can cherry pick all kinds of reasons why many other companies shouldn't expect shouldn't accept.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:10.760]   American Capital because you know, we don't really exactly have our shit together either proportion of these issues is the I think I think what what's Martha saying is the world the world is complicated.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.560]   I mean we had so under the previous president.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:32.060]   They said there could never be like a piece in the Middle East or a deal between Israel and and air powers and there was the Doha agreement where you had three Arab states signing peace treaties with Israel and Saudi Arabia allowing flights between Saudi Arabia and Israel for the first time and that's all because of MBC.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:54.460]   And there was an article in the Wall Street Journal talking about how King Salman actually was holding MBS back on this because you know, he's part of the previous generation who is backing the Palestinians and MBS just wants to move forward and actually get a deal done with Israel and if the Palestinians won't make it then he's willing to move forward without them and this is not me saying this is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.060]   Yeah, we need to dig up that piece.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:01.760]   So all I'm saying look what happened with that journalist was absolutely wrong, but clearly like.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:14.960]   Foreign relations is very complicated, especially in the Middle East and it's not clear that like net net Saudi Arabia probably just did the one wrong thing, which is that every country engages in extra judicial killings.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.160]   They just got caught right because I don't think it's fair to say that also tortured.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.360]   They also killed a journalist.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.960]   I think that Americans have done that.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.960]   Okay, we've done that as well as journalist.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.460]   Absolutely.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:31.460]   I don't think you actually have any idea the extent of what we have done during the course of these words in all of these countries.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.460]   I don't think you know.
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.060]   Well, I don't think I know.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.860]   So by saying that we and I think you're basically saying nobody knows if we chopped up a journalist who criticized.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.260]   Do you know who is in Al Grave Al Abu Grave?
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.060]   Do you really know?
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:49.260]   Do you know of all the other the worst one of the worst things we ever did and one of the things we need to aspire to do better to my brain.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.260]   So we've gone blunder around the Middle East for 20 years now in Afghanistan.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:59.160]   We supported warlords in Afghanistan who were allies with who were raping young boys.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   I mean this was like a giant series.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.960]   Of articles in the New York Times all over North Iran Contra.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.260]   I mean we've been doing this in C80 more recently in Libya.
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:14.160]   We basically got rid of get offy and plunge that whole country into Civil War and it's never recovered from it.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.860]   So look, I actually Jason I'm somewhere in between.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.360]   I actually agree with your idealism.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:25.060]   I'm my mind still blown that you actually work for AMC International, but I just think that the world is more complicated than that.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:30.860]   And sometimes we have to make choices and and the thing that concerns me is that.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:38.660]   That idealism that you're citing has become a prelude in a pretext for war in the over the last 20 years and we can to be clear.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.560]   I'm not advocating.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.460]   We go around the globe getting into these conflicts Libya Syria Iraq.
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:51.660]   You know, I'm Stan, you know, I'm anti-war, you know, I'm anti-war, you know, I'm anti-war, you know, I'm not advocating for invading places.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:59.360]   I'm advocating that we speak up when we see Saudi Arabia take a blogger Rafi Badawai.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.560]   Everybody did.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.960]   I mean that was universally condemned.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.760]   But but the question is at the end of the day.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.660]   Cained for writing blog posts.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.360]   What's alternative in Saudi Arabia?
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.960]   Who's our alternative there?
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.560]   We don't get to pick and choose who the leaders of these countries are.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.360]   Doesn't mean that doesn't I'm talking specifically about entrepreneurs capital allocators.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.660]   That doesn't mean we need to engage in business and building their chip stack.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:25.960]   If you want the sternly worded press release, you just got it from Biden to hopefully it's it Peaks.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.260]   It satisfies it quenches your thirst because the only other solution.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.760]   Us talking about actually if you want to know what I want, I want to see the three of you speak up for human rights.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.760]   That's what I would like to say.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.660]   I think that human rights in the United States is way more important to me than human rights anywhere else in the globe.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:48.760]   And I think that we have an abysmal track record of taking care of colored men and women in this country.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.860]   I don't disagree.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:57.060]   And so I have zero patience and tolerance for white men blathering on about shit that happens outside your own backyard.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.860]   Fix your own inside backyard.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.960]   Because you guys hold on.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.860]   Human rights here as well on because you guys are the ones that are get to diminish me for being white.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.360]   No, I understand.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.760]   But I'm saying that you are uniquely in your position of power in a way that the rest of us are not.
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.860]   And so when you guys clean up the inside, then we can go and fix the outside.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.160]   Yeah, I believe we can do both.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.660]   I believe we can do the same thing at the same time.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.760]   We could speak about human rights here.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.260]   We could speak about in Saudi Arabia.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.160]   We could speak about in China and we could talk about the same thing.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.260]   We can talk about all the human right issues from freedom of speech to murder.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:29.660]   I do.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.560]   I do constantly.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:30.960]   Really?
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.460]   Well, if you care so much about journalists, why haven't you spoken up in favor of Sonia songs?
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:41.760]   The way that Glenn Greenwald has of Julian Assange Assange and Snowden read Glenn Greenwald's reporting on these topics that we need to get to the bottom of both of those.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.460]   I in either case, we don't know the bottom of it.
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:49.960]   You've acted with complete certainty on Twitter saying that these guys are traitors and should be locked up in US prisons.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.360]   Oh, no, no.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.260]   I think we don't know.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.760]   I don't think we know who they're working for.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.560]   Why haven't you spent the time to learn?
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:56.760]   No.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.860]   Well, I mean it is a black box in that case.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.360]   We don't know.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.560]   We don't know in both of those cases what the backstory is.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.760]   I do think I do have a new.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.560]   You know about what's going on with the Uyghurs because you read in your article.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.260]   It's it's it's it's the one that you read the New York Times article about Snowden.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:19.860]   We have had people who have we have we have people who have defected and been on 60 minutes who were in those prisons.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.660]   You believe what you want to believe.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.260]   No, you literally can believe somebody who escaped from the prison.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.160]   You can believe them.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.060]   Yes with it when it comes to Julian Assange.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:37.560]   I don't know what to believe exactly because he released all those data dumps and he didn't do it properly like a journalist where he vetted the information with Snowden.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.860]   I'm more inclined to think that he was a good actor and I think it's a very nuanced position.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:51.160]   So if you want to try to paint me as like not knowing everything about every human rights violation in the world every nuanced position of a leaker, that's correct.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.760]   I don't know everything about everybody but I'm going to take that position.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:58.760]   I don't know anything about any of these things which is why I choose to focus on the things that I can control and I want to.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   Believe that I want to improve my own backyard, which I think is absolutely great.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:11.260]   And I think you can add an end there which is you should be talking about human rights and Hong Kong should be talking about in Saturday and should be talking about.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.460]   Okay, not my problem is the problem.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.360]   Not my problem.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.760]   I believe that's part of the problem right now.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.960]   You said it you you said it perfectly Chamath people don't care about human rights anymore.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.760]   There's a large group of people.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:28.460]   I agree with you who do not care about human rights the way I think they care about the local version of human rights fine.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.260]   Yeah, and I think you need to care about all of them and talk about all of them at the same time.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.560]   International Adventurism around human rights.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:49.560]   I don't support in the least and I do feel that a lot of this stuff is like the tip of the spear of people who then get morally absolute and say we have to fix this and the only solution is to invade these countries and instead I would just rather them if they really care about it.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.360]   Let them stand up and do what they need to do.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.360]   I think we need to fix our own backyard.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.160]   I mean look not to kind of bolster to my point, but there is a blind.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:14.160]   I turned to that which we don't want to believe or that narrative which we don't want to sell and then we point towards the narrative that we do and we see this all the time where the focal point of where should we be addressing human rights issues is where we have economic and geopolitical interest.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.960]   No one seems to be solving the problem in Somalia.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:26.660]   No one's getting on stage talking about the issues that people are facing in countries outside of where we have deep-rooted trade partnerships and serious economic interest.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.860]   And so, you know, like,
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:36.660]   we can tell ourselves all day long that we need to be kind of the absolutists and absolutely take care of the world because we're the beacon for human rights.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:45.160]   But the challenge is we end up being forced to choose where we want to spend our time and our resources and our resources go to where those resources flow back to us.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.860]   And that's often where we have a geopolitical and economic interest.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:53.560]   Now, Jason, I'll say I'll say one more thing like this because it's important Jake how can you called us all out?
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.560]   I am an absolute human rightist.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:09.060]   In the sense that I believe every human on Earth should have a right to do whatever they want within their own sphere of influence provided their sphere of influence does not intersect with the sphere of influence of others end of story.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:13.560]   And I don't see that happening anywhere on Earth and this ends up being a trade-off.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:27.260]   You always end up trading off your sphere of influence for that of the greater good or someone else because power allocates and power aggregates to specific places often to government sometimes to organize societal decisions that we say we're going to trade off.
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.260]   And I think that's a very important part of the question.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.260]   I think that's a very important part of the question.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.260]   I think that's a very important part of the question.
