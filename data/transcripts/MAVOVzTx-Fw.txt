[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160]   to see you all on this online webinar, and thankful for your faithfulness, and
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.400]   thankful for the opportunity that we have to study God's Word tonight. We're
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.600]   gonna be looking at Theology exam number 20 tonight, and it's a topic of
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.880]   sanctification, specifically dealing with the issue of present-day progressive
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.880]   sanctification, and I trust that this will be a wonderful study for all of us.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.280]   So thanks so much for your faithfulness. My wife and I had a great vacation last
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.040]   week, and just a good time recharging batteries and getting some rest up in
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.160]   the mountains, and thankful to be back with you tonight, and we're gonna make a
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.120]   strong finish to the Theology exams of this class. So we're looking at tonight
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.680]   Theology exam number 20, the issue of synergistic sanctification, which means
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.640]   that basically we cooperate with the grace of God in actively pursuing
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.320]   sanctification. I am gonna do a little bit of critique on that term "synergistic"
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.800]   tonight, and talk a little bit about the issue of monergistic versus synergistic
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.080]   sanctification, but I do think that the concept that we are dealing with tonight
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.320]   is plainly taught in the Word of God, and that is simply this, that the believer in
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.560]   Christ is called to actively pursue sanctification. We are called to actively
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.720]   battle for our sanctification, to be disciplined, to train ourselves for the
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.400]   purpose of godliness, to not be passive, to not be lazy in the pursuit of
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.460]   sanctification, and we're gonna see the balance in the teaching of what the
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.280]   Scriptures say, that we are called to pursue sanctification, and to exert
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.240]   diligent effort in pursuing Christ-likeness, and yet all of that is
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.280]   simply the expression of the grace of God working in our lives. And so this is
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.880]   a topic that I think is going to be helpful for all of us. We do need to be
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.240]   aware of some of the imbalances and some of the theological errors as it relates
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.560]   to sanctification, and so I think this study will be helpful to us. A couple of
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.080]   passages, just these aren't on your notes, but just to open our class with, Paul
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.360]   said in 1st Corinthians 15 verse 10, "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.460]   His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:12.840]   them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me." So you read that
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.920]   text and you ask the question, which is it, Paul? Was it God's grace working in
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.900]   your life that produced spiritual fruit and produced effective ministry, or were
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.400]   you the one who was doing the work? Was it you working hard, or was it God's
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   grace working in you? And Paul would say, according to this verse, that the answer
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:55.200]   is yes to both. I was working. I worked harder than any of them, he said. I didn't
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.640]   just sit back and wait for the grace of God to work in me. I didn't just
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:10.520]   passively expect God to do a work in my life. I worked hard, and I was working, and
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.040]   yet he immediately adds after making that statement that it was the grace of
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.560]   God working in me. So which is it? Was it God's grace working in you, or was it you
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:33.440]   working? And Paul says yes to both. I was working. I was working hard, but I was
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:42.920]   working because God's grace was working in me. That's the concept, basically, of
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.120]   synergistic sanctification. God's grace is the one that does the work. God's
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.060]   grace is working in us. The Holy Spirit is working in us to make us more like
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.520]   Jesus Christ, and yet the grace of God working in us does not produce a passive
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:10.320]   approach to spiritual life. The grace of God working in us produces a Christian
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.120]   who works hard, who actively and diligently trains for godliness, who
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.520]   actively pursues sanctification. That's basically what this essay topic is about,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.040]   this concept of synergistic sanctification. I am working. God's grace
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.440]   is working. I am working because God's grace is working, and the truth is that
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.080]   my working out my salvation with fear and trembling is evidence of God's doing
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.320]   His work in my life. So I do believe this is a very important topic tonight, and
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:03.040]   one that I trust will be helpful in your studies. I've been a pastor now for 25
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.920]   years. I have seen aberrant views of sanctification come and go in the church.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.960]   I have seen how wrong views of sanctification affect people's lives.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.920]   I've seen wrong views of sanctification affect the church, and just the trends
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.400]   come and go, and it's really important that we understand the doctrine of
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.280]   present-day progressive sanctification and hold those truths in balance, that we
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.200]   are called to work out our salvation with fear and trembling, always with the
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.360]   confidence that it is God who is doing His work in us, and that He will be
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.520]   faithful to complete the work that He began in us. So I trust that this will be
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.640]   a good hour of reflection on that theme. Let me pray for us, and let's devote this
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.200]   time to the Lord. Let's pray. Well, Father, we do thank You that You are always
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.680]   working in our lives. We thank You that You are the one who has begun the work
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.040]   in us, and that You are the one who will be faithful to complete that work at the
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.240]   day of Christ Jesus. We thank You that You are working to make us more like
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:26.480]   Your Son, Jesus Christ. We thank You that You are working to make us more holy. We
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.360]   thank You that You are working through the trials in our lives, through the
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.760]   disappointments, through even the heartaches and the difficulties, through
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.960]   the various trials that we encounter in this life. You are working through it all
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:50.920]   to make us more like Christ. We thank You that it is because You are working that
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:58.160]   we are able to work out our salvation with fear and with trembling. And so we
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.200]   pray that we would understand the doctrine of sanctification biblically,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.540]   and that we would be able to make application to our lives. And we would
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:16.160]   pray that even for this hour of study, that both dynamics would be true of even
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:23.640]   this hour, that we would work hard, that we would work hard to understand, to
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.200]   clarify, to read, to be precise about what Your Word teaches regarding
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:37.320]   sanctification. And yet, our working hard would be simply the expression of You
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:43.760]   performing Your work in us. Do Your work in each of our hearts tonight, and bear
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:51.360]   fruit, we pray, for Your glory. And so we give this time to You, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.720]   Amen. Well, let's read the question together, and then we're gonna dive into
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   our notes tonight. Again, we're looking at Theology Exam number 20. The question
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:08.560]   is, "Explain the synergistic nature of sanctification, being sure to describe the
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:15.960]   relationship between God's grace and moral effort in the Christian life." So,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:23.480]   the question wants us to deal with the synergistic nature of sanctification, and
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:30.040]   then to describe the relationship between God's grace and moral effort. And
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   a key verse in that discussion is, as I just mentioned, 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:45.120]   verse 10, as well as Philippians chapter 2 verses 12 and 13. So, you will remember
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.160]   that this is the second question on the ACBC Theology Exams, which deal with the
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.480]   subject of sanctification. You'll remember that Theology Exam number 19
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:06.160]   asked us to explain the biblical categories of past, present, and future
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.680]   sanctification. So, we looked at that last time that we met, that there is a past
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:19.360]   aspect to sanctification, which theologians refer to as definitive or
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   positional sanctification. That we have been sanctified at the moment of
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:34.300]   conversion. There was a decisive break between the believer and the power of
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.840]   sin. The believer has been united with Christ in his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.800]   And so, we have been set apart in the past. We have been sanctified in the
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.120]   sense that we are no longer living as slaves to sin. We are no longer under the
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:00.520]   dominion of sin. And so, each of us can rightly be called saints. We are saints
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:08.640]   because we have been sanctified. And so, that is the truth of past sanctification.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.800]   We move then to the present aspect of sanctification, which theologians refer to
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:25.760]   as progressive sanctification. Having been sanctified and having gained the
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:33.400]   identity of being saints, we now pursue sanctification in our daily lives. Each
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   of us as believers are in the process of becoming practically more like Jesus
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:47.760]   Christ in our daily lives. And so, little by little, day by day, we are becoming
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.640]   more like Jesus Christ. Sometimes, that sanctification seems slow. Sometimes, we
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:01.360]   feel that we are not making the progress that we ought to. Sometimes, sanctification
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   is two steps forward, one step back. And yet, little by little, over days, over
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:15.000]   months, over years, we are progressively conformed to be more like Jesus Christ.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.200]   And that is the work God is doing in our lives. So, we have been sanctified. We are
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.800]   being sanctified. And then, we looked at the issue of future sanctification, which
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.480]   can also be called ultimate or perfective sanctification. The truth that
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:40.000]   one day, we will be perfectly sanctified. In the words of 1 Thessalonians 5, verse
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:50.040]   23, we will be completely sanctified. We will be like Christ. 1 John 3, verses 1
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:58.080]   to 3 says, "For we shall see him as he is." So, we look forward to the day and live
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:05.120]   in the hope that one day, we will be perfectly sanctified. One day, there will
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:12.800]   be no more struggle with sin. There will be no more battling temptation. We shall
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:19.880]   perfectly be like Jesus Christ. And we long for that day, the future aspect of
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:27.520]   our sanctification. We have been sanctified. We are being sanctified. And
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:35.440]   one day, we will perfectly be sanctified. So, we looked at that, those three
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   categories, last time we met. And in this essay, Theology exam number 20, we're
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:50.120]   zeroing in on that second aspect, the present-day sanctification that each of
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:56.760]   us are engaged with in our Christian lives. We're really zeroing in on what is
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:04.960]   progressive sanctification. How does sanctification work in our present-day
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:13.000]   lives, as we are progressively being made to be more like Jesus Christ? The
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.360]   question is, is it God's grace, which is doing the work in our lives, or are we
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.120]   doing the work in studying the Scripture, seeking the Lord in prayer, attending
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.720]   church, and serving in church ministry? Is God's grace doing the work, or are we
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   doing the work? And we will find that Scripture affirms both. We are working
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   because God is working. And that is the concept that is really summarized under
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:15:00.640]   the idea of synergistic sanctification. So, I think this question is really
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.280]   designed to guard against two unbalanced views of sanctification, and I'm putting
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.120]   this on the slides. This isn't on your handout, but let me just note this here,
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:17.080]   because I think this is helpful for us, and I think this will really give a
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.000]   rationale as to why we should write this essay and why devote ourselves to the
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.880]   study of this subject. There are really two unbalanced views of sanctification that we
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.800]   want to guard against in our understanding of progressive
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:39.880]   sanctification. The first unbalanced view is the quietistic view of sanctification.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:47.920]   The quietistic view. This view basically says that the believer is passive in
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:54.360]   sanctification. This is the view which is commonly summarized by the statement, "Let
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:02.760]   go and let God." John MacArthur writes this, "Quietism tends to be mystical and
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   subjective, focusing on personal feelings and experiences. A person who is utterly
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:17.080]   submitted to and dependent on God, they say, will be divinely protected from sin
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:24.660]   and led into faithful living. Trying to strive against sin or discipline oneself
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:33.040]   to produce good works is considered not only futile but unspiritual and
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:39.680]   counterproductive." So, this is the quietistic approach to sanctification.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:46.120]   The idea that you're just passive or you've reached a level of spirituality
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.240]   or spiritual maturity where you don't need to pray anymore, you don't need to
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:56.000]   read the Bible anymore, you can kind of just coast your way to greater
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.760]   sanctification. Now, dear friends, you see the problem with this is that it's not
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:10.800]   only unbiblical, but this approach to sanctification does not work. No one is
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:19.000]   sanctified apart from active, diligent devotion to the biblical means of
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.760]   sanctification. No one just coasts their way into holiness. Paul even described
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:36.600]   his ministry in this way in Colossians 1, verse 29, where he says,
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:44.560]   "For this I toil, I labor, I work to the point of exhaustion," is the meaning of the
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:50.880]   original Greek word. "For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.440]   powerfully works within me." So, that's another key verse that you might want to
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:05.880]   note down. First Colossians 1, verse 29. God is working. God is powerfully working
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:12.080]   in the Apostle Paul, and the expression of God working in his life is that he is
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:20.040]   toiling. He is working to the point of exhaustion, all because God is performing
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:30.880]   God's work in Paul. So, the quietistic view is basically you can be passive, let
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:38.000]   go, and let God. You can see why this view is very popular. There are forms of the
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.880]   quietistic view that show up in every age and in every season of the church.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:50.640]   Believe me, the quietistic view of sanctification is very well and
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:57.480]   alive today in the modern-day church. You will find that this view will show up in
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   your counseling sessions with people that you counsel. Just kind of this
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:09.260]   passive approach. "Why am I not growing? Why am I not becoming a more godly person?
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.640]   Why am I not becoming more spiritually mature? Why am I not experiencing more
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.560]   spiritual victories?" And you get into counseling sessions, and you find that
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.640]   this person is not reading the Bible, is not praying, is not attending church, is
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.840]   not in fellowship, and yet there's this sort of idea that the Holy Spirit's
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.880]   gonna do this work in my life. Apart from those means, apart from my diligent
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.120]   devotion to those means, I can kind of let go and let God and the Holy Spirit
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:45.800]   supposed to do work in my life. That's the quietistic view of sanctification.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.880]   And that leads to the second unbalanced view of sanctification, which is the
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:58.680]   opposite extreme. This is the pietistic view of sanctification. The pietistic
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:07.040]   view of sanctification. As John MacArthur writes, "This unbalanced view of pietism
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:13.680]   often leads to an overemphasis on self-effort to the virtual exclusion of
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:21.960]   dependence on divine power." So, on one hand, the quietist says, "Do nothing and
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.800]   you'll be sanctified." The pietist says, "Do everything. It's all on you. You have to
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:38.120]   make it happen. It's all up to you if you're gonna be sanctified." As MacArthur
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:45.000]   observes, "As you might expect, pietism frequently leads to legalism, moralism,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:56.120]   self-righteousness, a judgmental spirit, pride, and hypocrisy." So, I love what
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:03.560]   C.H. Spurgeon said. He said, "Work as if it all depended on you, and then pray as if it
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:11.840]   all depended on God." And I think that's the balance between quietism and pietism.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.120]   Pietism is not a biblical view of sanctification. It may look
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.800]   impressive because a person is really working hard at their Christian life, but
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:28.120]   there is not the accompanying dependence upon the grace of God, a healthy
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.600]   dependence upon the Holy Spirit, a realization of what Jesus said to his
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:43.520]   disciples that, "Apart from me, you can do nothing." Pietism oftentimes looks like a
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:50.120]   high-performance type of Christianity that is fueled more by pride and
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:58.040]   self-reliance than upon a reliance upon God and a reliance upon the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:05.320]   And we do meet pietists in the counseling ministry. They may not call
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:11.560]   themselves pietists. They may just call themselves high achievers or those who
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:17.840]   are devoted to a standard of excellence, but when you talk to a pietist, you will
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:25.000]   often find that there is this absence of peace in their Christian lives. There is
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.800]   this anxious sort of toil, this anxiety and fear that is really driving this
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:39.840]   performance, and it often leads to exhaustion and burnout. You see, the
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:47.080]   pietist neglects to emphasize the truth that, in the end, sanctification is
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:55.120]   completely the work of God. Sanctification is the work of the Holy
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:02.360]   Spirit in our lives. 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 23 says, "Now may the God of peace
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:17.960]   kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." Pietism neglects to hold on
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:23.960]   to that truth that it is God who has begun the good work in me, and it is
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:31.560]   God who will complete it at the day of Christ Jesus. Now just a pastoral note
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:37.480]   here that I've seen the destructive effects of both quietism and pietism in
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:45.320]   the church and in individual Christians lives, and I've seen how both quietism
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:52.960]   and pietism appeal to the flesh. Both erroneous approaches to sanctification
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:24:00.800]   appeal to self, appeal to the flesh in different ways. Quietism appeals to the
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.740]   flesh by saying you can be lazy and you don't need to work hard in order to be
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:12.960]   sanctified. Quietism says, you know, you see all those people in the church that
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.120]   they're reading their Bibles and they're going to church and they're
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.280]   taking the Lord's table and they're engaging in ministry. You don't need to
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.960]   be like them. You can kind of just be the exception to the rule, and you can be
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:36.380]   sanctified apart from those activities. But pietism appeals to self by saying,
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:42.420]   you know, you can do it. Sort of the American spirit, you know, you can do it,
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.980]   you can make it happen, you can achieve, you can work hard, you can be an
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:54.900]   excellent Christian by your own efforts. And if you just work really hard and
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.860]   just really get serious about your Christian life, you can achieve higher
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:06.660]   levels of sanctification and spirituality. And that approach to
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:12.300]   sanctification neglects the healthy dependence upon God, the healthy
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.580]   dependence upon the Holy Spirit, and the acknowledgment that says that are from
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:26.060]   Christ I can do nothing. So how do we avoid both of these extremes? How do we
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:34.660]   avoid both pietism and quietism in our pursuit of sanctification? How do we
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:42.020]   emphasize both the grace of God in our lives and our dependence upon God's
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:48.020]   grace and His power in our lives, as well as emphasize our responsibility to
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:56.660]   engage in diligent pursuit of spiritual maturity and holiness? Well, that's why
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:02.060]   this topic is so important, and I hope this would fuel your motivation to write
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:09.460]   this essay. Let me just note on your handout there just some helpful
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:15.780]   resources on this topic you have listed on page 1, the reading from Wayne Grudem,
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:21.460]   Heath Lambert, and Anthony Hokoma. Those are all good resources on the topic of
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.940]   sanctification. And then just a few blog posts that I want to encourage you to
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:33.340]   read. There's a couple blog posts there by Mike Riccardi, who is a pastor at
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:39.060]   Grace Community Church. Just some really excellent material on the subject of
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:45.860]   sanctification. I'm going to refer back to his works in just a moment. Just very
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:53.580]   balanced, biblical, insightful, helpful, pastoral, and practical. I just so
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:59.940]   appreciate Pastor Riccardi's work on sanctification, and it's available on the
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:07.260]   Cripplegate blog. And then a blog post on sanctification by Kevin DeYoung, who is
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:14.460]   a very insightful writer on a number of topics, and he deals with the subject of
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:20.340]   synergistic sanctification. Now, you're going to find that both Mike Riccardi
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:27.980]   and Kevin DeYoung take issue with the term synergistic sanctification, and I'm
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:33.740]   going to take the same issue as well. I don't want to get off topic here because
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:39.420]   my purpose here is not so much to critique the question, but I will say at
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:47.300]   the outset that I don't believe the term synergistic sanctification is wrong. I
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.780]   don't believe that it is erroneous, but perhaps it is a little bit of a clumsy
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:28:00.700]   way to describe the biblical dynamic of sanctification. And if you read Riccardi
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:05.060]   and DeYoung on the subject, they basically point out the fact that the
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:14.460]   terms monergistic and synergistic were initially used in church history to
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:21.180]   define the doctrine of regeneration. Regeneration, which is the granting of
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:29.340]   new life in Christ. And theologians took pains to define regeneration as being
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:37.300]   monergistic in nature. The work of one literally. Regeneration is monergistic
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:43.820]   because there's no way for a dead man to make himself alive. Man cannot cooperate
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:50.900]   with God in regeneration because, as Ephesians 2 verse 1 says, man is dead in
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:57.100]   his sins and trespasses, and so a sinner can do nothing to cooperate with the
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:04.100]   work of regeneration. Regeneration, therefore, is monergistic in nature. So in
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.140]   reference to the doctrine of regeneration, the terms monergistic and
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:17.100]   synergistic are helpful terms. But what both Riccardi and DeYoung are basically
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:22.260]   pointing out is that we've taken these terms which are helpful to define the
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:28.300]   doctrine of regeneration and then tried to use them in relation to the doctrine
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:34.260]   of sanctification. And in the discussion of the doctrine of sanctification, the
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:43.340]   terms monergistic and synergistic are less helpful. So again, I don't want to
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:47.460]   get off topic, and I was telling my wife this morning that my poor class is gonna
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.300]   have to bear with me a little bit tonight because my purpose is not so
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.380]   much to critique the term synergistic sanctification, and I would just say that
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:03.460]   your purpose in writing these essays is not to critique the term synergistic
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:10.900]   sanctification, but I do want to point out that I'm very helped by
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:16.780]   these insights into the term monergistic and synergistic sanctification because
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.460]   believe it or not, I have struggled over the last ten years to understand the
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:27.980]   terminology monergistic sanctification versus synergistic sanctification, and in
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:33.620]   my own studies and in my own heart, I've kept wondering, "Is sanctification
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:39.380]   monergistic or synergistic?" And I kept coming up with biblical texts which
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:45.860]   seem to indicate that it is monergistic in the sense that it is ultimately the
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:51.060]   work of God, and it is synergistic in that we are involved in exerting moral
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:55.460]   effort, and I've always struggled to understand that terminology, and those
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:02.620]   two blog posts were very helpful for me. So I want to commend those to you, and I
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:10.100]   hope that'll be helpful reading for your study. So all that to say, don't write
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:16.780]   your essay on critiquing the term synergistic sanctification. Write your
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:23.020]   essay on the subject of how God's grace is working in our lives to sanctify us
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:28.380]   at the same time we are working and actively engaged in sanctification, and
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:33.020]   you will do fine, but I do want to just share that point because I think it's
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:41.860]   been helpful to me, and hopefully helpful to you as well. So let's talk about
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:47.700]   synergistic sanctification. Again, I think it's a little bit of a clumsy phrase, but
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:54.700]   I do think that the heart of it, the main idea that's captured in that phrase is
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:03.500]   what is taught in Scripture. God's grace is working, and we are working. So just on
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:10.900]   your notes on page 2, under synergistic sanctification, letter A, we do observe
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.860]   that God's people are to be marked by passion for holiness. We covered some of
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:21.020]   this material two weeks ago. I just want to emphasize this because it is so
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:28.420]   crucial just on a practical note. I'm teaching this session not only to equip
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:34.140]   you to write a good essay on this topic, but also to remind you that as biblical
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:42.340]   counselors, we need to be marked by a passion for sanctification and holiness.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:50.340]   This ought to be what people see when they observe our lives, not a perfect
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.860]   person or a perfect counselor, but a counselor who is daily repenting of sin,
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.380]   a counselor who is daily seeking the Lord in prayer, a counselor who is
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:04.900]   devoted to the means of grace in the local church, a counselor who takes his
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:11.620]   or her own personal holiness very seriously. I'm reminded of the minister
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:17.420]   who said that my people's greatest need is my personal holiness, and that is true
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:22.880]   of each counselor as well. Your counselee's greatest need is your
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:32.140]   personal holiness. God blesses sanctified vessels. Again, this will never be
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.700]   something that we completely attain to, but it ought to be the passion that
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:47.020]   marks our lives. We are called to engage in this this pursuit. 1 Peter 1 verse 14,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:52.380]   "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:57.940]   ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:04.020]   conducts, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" The meaning of
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:08.900]   holiness is to be set apart. God has called us to be set apart from the world,
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:15.180]   to be set apart from sin, to be consecrated unto him. That involves the
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:19.980]   pursuit of moral purity, but it's a broader idea as well. It involves the
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:27.580]   complete consecration of heart, soul, mind, and will to the Lord and to his purposes.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.540]   When people look at our lives, they ought to see someone who has been set apart
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:39.900]   unto the Lord and set apart unto his purposes, and that is the idea of
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:45.860]   sanctification. Now, jumping down to letter B on your handout, we see that
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:52.740]   sanctification affects more than a person's external morality. So
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:35:02.220]   sanctification is more than external behavior. Matthew 23 verse 25, Jesus said,
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:08.780]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you clean the outside of
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.500]   the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:20.600]   You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:29.100]   outside also may be clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:34.180]   are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:41.580]   are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. You also outwardly appear
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:50.220]   righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness." So we
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.620]   observe there that sanctification is more than external morality. It's more
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:02.540]   than external behavior. Sanctification must transform the heart, the will, the
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:10.380]   desires. Sanctification must result in a new affection, a new purpose, a new
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:17.820]   passion to live for the glory of Christ. As Charles Hodge has written in his
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:24.740]   systematic theology, "Sanctification does not consist exclusively in a series of a
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:31.380]   new kind of acts. It is making the tree good." Now remember, those of you who took
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:36.940]   ACBC year one basic training course with me, remember all the trees that we drew
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:42.560]   throughout that course. It's a biblical concept that's reflected in these
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:50.460]   theological writings. We're not here to merely trim weeds or to trim thorns on
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.580]   the external behavior that's represented by the outside of the tree. We're here to
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:04.420]   dig at the roots. We're here to transform hearts. And so Hodge writes that
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:10.820]   sanctification is making the tree good in order that the fruit may be good. That
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:16.780]   could have been written from a biblical counseling textbook. He says it involves
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:26.380]   an essential change of character, just as regeneration is a new birth, a new
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:36.460]   creation, a quickening, or communicating a new life. So sanctification in its
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:42.220]   essential nature is not holy acts, but such a change in the state of the soul
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:49.700]   that sinful acts become more infrequent and holy acts more and more habitual and
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:59.260]   controlling. Michael Cardy agrees. He says the believer's growth in holiness is
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:09.180]   fundamentally internal and supernatural. The term metamorpho, translated
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:16.620]   transformation, describes the inner transformation of the essence of a
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:24.140]   person, an inward change in fundamental character. Holiness does not simply mean
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:30.880]   bringing our outward behavior into conformity to an external standard.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:37.180]   Hypocrites can do that. The inward transformation of the mind, which is to
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:43.820]   say the character or the affections, will indeed work itself out in external
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:52.860]   behavior, but the transformation begins internally. So when you minister to your
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:59.660]   counselee, you need to pray more than that their behavior changes. You need to
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:05.500]   pray that their hearts will change. You need to target your prayers to the heart
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:11.900]   of the counselee and ask that God would change your counselee's hearts through
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:20.060]   the Word of God, and that is my prayer whenever I minister God's Word, and that
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.900]   should be all of our prayers whenever we minister God's Word. Lord, change your
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:30.140]   people's hearts through your precious Word, through the ministry of the
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:35.940]   Holy Spirit. So let me move to the next page there and just get to the issue of
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:41.260]   is sanctification synergistic or monergistic? I've already made some
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.460]   comments on this. I won't belabor the point, but just introduce the terms.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:52.700]   Monergistic means literally the work of one from the word mono meaning one and
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:40:00.540]   erg meaning work. Synergistic speaks of man's cooperation in sanctification
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:09.420]   using the term sin, which means with. As I've noted, this essay asks you to write
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:15.420]   about the synergistic nature of sanctification, yet it is interesting the
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:21.980]   term synergistic is not found in the ACBC Standards of Doctrine, and it's also
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:27.940]   not found in the doctrinal statement of my church, Kindred Community Church. As
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:34.580]   we've noted, the term synergistic sanctification is commonly used to
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:40.940]   describe a view of sanctification which emphasizes the believer's active pursuit
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:48.500]   of godliness, yet there are some reasons why synergistic may not be the best term
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.820]   to describe the concept. So please indulge me for a moment. This has been a
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:41:00.180]   10-year journey, and I put some notes down here even though I don't think this
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:06.240]   is really the focus of the essay. I hope this might be helpful in a broad
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.660]   understanding. You'll note here that Heath Lambert does use the term
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:17.620]   synergistic sanctification in his work, A Theology of Biblical Counseling. He says
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:24.740]   that sanctification is a synergistic process, meaning that God and man
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:31.740]   cooperate in the work. Human effort is involved. Other aspects of salvation, like
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:39.060]   regeneration and justification, which we discussed previously, are monergistic. The
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:45.180]   word monergism means that God alone does the work to bring about these results.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:50.020]   Sanctification is a synergistic work. It involves our effort, but this effort is
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:57.540]   made possible by divine enablement. Our striving is made possible by divine
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:03.340]   grace. Now I think that's a good statement. I think that's a fine
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:08.380]   statement. I think if you quote that statement in your essay that your essay
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:13.980]   will pass. I do think that synergistic sanctification as defined in that way,
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:20.900]   that it involves human effort, but human effort is the expression of divine grace
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:28.540]   working in a person's life, that that is, as far as it goes, a good and a fine
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:36.420]   definition of sanctification. I do think that the concern with the term
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:43.140]   synergistic sanctification is not so much in what it teaches as in what it
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:50.860]   might open itself up to. The term synergism might leave open the question,
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:58.180]   "Do you mean then that sanctification is 50% up to God and then 50% up to me?" I
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:04.060]   don't think the term necessarily teaches that, but it might leave open that
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:09.700]   misunderstanding, and that's why I say it's not so much an incorrect term as it
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:18.660]   might be a bit of a clumsy one. So listen to Kevin DeYoung on this subject, and
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:23.980]   maybe this isn't interesting to anyone but me, but it is incredibly interesting
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:29.300]   to me, so let me proceed. Kevin DeYoung discusses the term synergism and
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:35.420]   monergism in relation to sanctification, and he writes, "I think it is best to stay
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:41.620]   away from both terms. The distinction is very helpful and very important when
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:47.460]   talking about regeneration, but these particular theological terms, that is
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:53.300]   synergism and monergism, muddy the waters when talking about sanctification.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:58.780]   Synergism sounds like a swear word to Reform folks, so no one wants to say it,
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:05.180]   and yet monergism is not the right word either. Those who say sanctification is
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:11.260]   monergistic want to protect the gracious supernatural character of
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:16.700]   sanctification. Those who say sanctification is synergistic want to
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.060]   emphasize that we must actively cooperate with the grace and
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:26.820]   sanctification." So here it is. Here's the main point, what DeYoung is saying and
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:36.060]   what I agree with. These emphases are both correct, and yet I believe it is
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:41.220]   better to defend both of these points with careful explanation rather than
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:46.540]   with terms that have normally been employed in a different theological
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:52.780]   controversy, that is, the controversy over regeneration. And so DeYoung
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:45:00.940]   concludes that sanctification is both a gracious gift of God and it requires our
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:11.060]   active cooperation. And what he's saying there is instead of using these terms,
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:16.420]   it might be better to do the hard work of just explaining the texts that deal
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.940]   with this subject, and that's the approach that I took when I wrote this
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:26.140]   essay. I didn't use the terms monergistic or synergistic. I just dealt
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:31.620]   with a text, just went to Philippians 2 verses 12 to 13, 1 Corinthians 15 verse
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:37.460]   10, the passages which call for moral efforts, such as 1st Timothy chapter 4
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.220]   verse 7, and just deal with the text, explain the text, and if you take that
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:50.380]   approach, you'll do fine. Listen to Mike Riccardi on this subject, and I just so
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:56.700]   appreciate his writing on sanctification. He says, "On the one hand, we want to give
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:02.820]   the credit of our sanctification, the actual progress of becoming increasingly
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:08.900]   like Christ, where it belongs to God." I mean, would you say an amen to that? I
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.660]   mean, we want, in the end of the day, if there's any progress made in my
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.180]   spiritual life, if I'm in any way made to be more like Christ, I don't want people
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:21.620]   to pat me on the back. I don't want to pat myself on the back. I want to give
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:28.500]   all glory to God. It was God's work in my life which enabled me to grow in Christ.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.540]   And so Riccardi is saying that's the desire of every Christian. We want to
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:40.340]   give all glory to God. So he says, "The term monergistic seems attractive,
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:45.020]   especially to us Calvinists who want to take no credit for the good in our
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:50.380]   spiritual lives and give all glory to Christ. On the other hand, though, we don't
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:54.860]   want to discount our role in our sanctification and give the impression
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:01.620]   that we are completely passive." And we would also say amen to that. We want to
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:08.180]   hold fast to the biblical exhortations which call for moral effort and the
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:14.020]   active pursuit of godliness. So Riccardi says, "I believe the answer is to
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:19.940]   recognize the unhelpfulness of using either of these adjectives to describe
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:25.540]   the sanctification process. The terms monergistic sanctification and
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:32.500]   synergistic sanctification are both misnomers and are therefore unhelpful. It
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:37.860]   might not be as neat and tidy to explain, but if we are to be biblical, we have to
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:44.380]   maintain the truth of both realities in Philippians 2 verses 12 to 13, even if it
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:50.260]   means more words of explanation." So Riccardi is saying basically the same
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:56.780]   thing DeYoung has written. Just go to the text of Scripture, explain what's there.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:02.980]   It may take more words and a little more effort, but if you deal with the text of
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:09.300]   Scripture, you will do fine on this subject. Okay, I'm gonna get off my hobby
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:15.580]   horse here and devote the rest of this time to helping you actually write this
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:21.740]   essay. So what are the key truths regarding sanctification that you need
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:30.220]   to be able to handle under the umbrella of synergistic sanctification? Truth
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:37.660]   number one is that sanctification is a sovereign work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:45.660]   Sanctification is a sovereign work of the Holy Spirit. This ought to give
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:52.780]   everyone who is struggling with sanctification hope. This ought to give
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:58.220]   everyone who is struggling with a specific sin issue in their life great
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:04.140]   encouragement that ultimately sanctification is the work of the Holy
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:09.140]   Spirit. You may not feel like you can grow in this area. You may not feel like
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:14.700]   you can overcome this sin. You may not feel up to the task of overcoming
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:21.860]   temptation, but by the power of the Holy Spirit who lives in you, you can grow and
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:26.700]   you can be sanctified. Now dear friends, I've used that conversation in
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:33.100]   counseling ministry to encourage believers to say the hope is not in you
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:38.540]   or in your abilities or in your knowledge or your strength, but I believe
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:44.740]   that the Holy Spirit lives in you and by his power, because he is producing his
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.740]   fruit in you, I believe that you can grow and you can deal with this issue in your
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:57.940]   life. Ultimately, sanctification is not the work of man. It is not merely the
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:05.740]   work or the product of more discipline, more effort, getting more serious.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:13.540]   Ultimately, sanctification is the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit in a
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:19.020]   believer's life to conform that believer to the character of Christ and why does
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:23.060]   the Holy Spirit want to conform us to the character of Christ? It is because
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:30.940]   the Holy Spirit loves Christ. John 16 verse 14, he does all things to glorify
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:36.780]   Christ. Have you ever thought about the fact that your sanctification is
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:45.060]   ultimately not about you? You're just caught up in this inter-trinitarian love
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:51.580]   relationship that the Father has sent the Son to redeem a bride, the Spirit has
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:57.900]   come into the world to glorify the Son, and the Spirit is active in bringing
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:05.060]   sinners to new life and then actively conforming those believers to the
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:11.060]   character of Christ all for the glory of Jesus Christ. It's because the Spirit
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:17.820]   desires to glorify Christ that the Spirit is active in your sanctification.
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:23.540]   John Owen puts it this way, "The Lord Christ sends his Holy Spirit into our
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:29.620]   hearts, which is the efficient cause of all holiness and sanctification,
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:37.420]   quickening, enlightening, purifying the souls of his saints. In the end, that is
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:44.860]   my hope in sanctification. I have hope for myself because the Holy Spirit lives
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:50.580]   in me, and I have hope for other believers because I believe in the power
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:57.300]   and the ministry of the Holy Spirit." John Murray puts it this way, "It is necessary
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:03.380]   to be reminded that in the last analysis we do not sanctify ourselves. It is God
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:09.940]   who sanctifies. Specifically, it is the Holy Spirit who is the agent of
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:17.940]   sanctification. It is imperative that we realize our, and underline these words,
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:28.020]   complete dependence upon the Holy Spirit. That is the idea of dependence and yet
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:35.540]   active involvement in the sanctification process. 2 Thessalonians 2 verse 13, "But
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:40.100]   we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, beloved by the Lord,
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:45.500]   because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved through sanctification by
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:50.540]   the Spirit." And then many other verses there emphasizing the Spirit's work in
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:58.460]   sanctification. Let me move to truth number two. If sanctification is the work
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.420]   of the Holy Spirit, then do we just let go and let God and just let the Holy
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:07.860]   Spirit work and just passively expect the Spirit to work in our lives, as Paul
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:16.380]   would say? May it never be. Truth number two is that the Spirit uses means to
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:26.700]   sanctify the believer. The Spirit uses means to sanctify us. So an example of
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:33.380]   this, I might say that, you know, the Holy Spirit helped me or led me to love my
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:39.060]   neighbor. The Holy Spirit led me to ride a car to my neighbor and to give a nice
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:45.620]   gift and leave it on my neighbor's porch. The Holy Spirit led me to do that. But
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:51.060]   what do I really mean when I say that the Holy Spirit led me to love my neighbor?
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:56.500]   Do I mean that the Holy Spirit just sort of zapped me one day and all of a sudden
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:05.500]   I felt this love for my neighbor? Or do I mean that on one Sunday I went to my
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:12.060]   local church and I sat in church service and I heard my pastor preach a message
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:18.820]   on loving my neighbor, and then I wrote down notes as I heard the message, and
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:23.060]   then I went to lunch with other Christians and we talked about the
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:28.380]   message and how it might apply to our lives. And I went home and I reviewed my
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:33.540]   notes and I read the passage again, and I prayed for God to help me to be a doer
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:39.780]   of His Word and not a hearer only. I went to my small group where we discussed the
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:44.980]   sermon and we discussed how we might apply it to our lives, and it is
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:49.820]   through my attendance at my church, and it is through the fellowship of the
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:54.780]   saints, and it is through reflection and study and prayer. It is through those
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:55:03.660]   means that the Holy Spirit worked in my life and led me to love my neighbor, and
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:09.940]   as a result, my neighbor received a nice card and a nice little gift on his or
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:20.180]   her porch. Sanctification is a work of the Spirit, and yet the Spirit uses means
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:26.060]   to produce that sanctification, the means of study of God's Word and prayer and
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:31.140]   persevering through trials and fellowship and encouraging one another
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:37.420]   in the local church. And we see that the primary means that the Spirit uses to
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:43.660]   sanctify believers is the Word of God. Ephesians 6 verse 17 says that the sword
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:52.700]   of the Spirit is the Word of God. And so, sanctification is a work of the Spirit,
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:59.300]   and yet the Spirit uses means to sanctify the believer. Let me move to the
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:08.940]   next page there and look at truth number three. The Spirit works through means to
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:13.820]   make us more like Christ. So truth number three is that the believer is called to
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:20.860]   diligently pursue sanctification. The believer is called to diligently pursue
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.940]   sanctification. Many verses there that you can read on your own, but we know
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:31.940]   that the Bible does not excuse laziness or passivity in our sanctification. In
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:38.140]   other words, if you and I are not being sanctified, if we're not growing, don't
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:45.500]   blame the Holy Spirit. Don't say that, well, it's the Holy Spirit's fault that I'm
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:52.820]   not growing, because the Holy Spirit, it's His job to sanctify me. The reason why you
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:57.340]   and I are not being sanctified, it's not the Holy Spirit's fault, it is that
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:02.900]   because we're not fulfilling our responsibility to read God's Word, to be
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:07.620]   part of the local church, and to take the Lord's table regularly, and to be
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:12.300]   involved in the one another's of the local church. We're not enduring trials
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:19.380]   with joy. We're not actively involved in the spiritual disciplines. That is why we
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:26.860]   are not growing. It is not the Holy Spirit's fault that we are not growing
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:34.300]   in Christ. 1 Timothy 4 verse 7 says, "Have nothing to do with irreverent silly
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:40.380]   myths, rather train yourselves for godliness." Verse 10 says, "For to this
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:50.420]   end we toil and strive, because we have our hopes set on the living God." And then
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:55.260]   I'll just highlight 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 25, where Paul says, "Every
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:59.980]   athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:06.980]   perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly, I do not box
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:13.620]   as one beating the air, but I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:19.420]   after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified." The believers
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:28.940]   call to diligently pursue sanctification, and we found that this is true. John
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:34.780]   Calvin says, "It is an arduous work, and of immense labor, to put off the
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:40.580]   corruption which is in us." He bids us to strive and to make every effort for this
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:46.580]   purpose. He intimates that no place is to be given in this case to sloth, and that
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:52.540]   we ought to obey God, calling us not slowly or carelessly, but that there is
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:59.820]   need of alacrity, as though he had said, "Put forth every effort and make your
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:09.700]   exertions manifest to all." The more your discipline, the more you train, the more
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:14.620]   you will be sanctified. Now does that mean that sanctification is dependent on
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:23.220]   us? May it never be. That discipline is simply the expression of God's grace
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:30.500]   working in us. When I set my alarm, and when I wake up in the morning, and when I
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:36.260]   read my Bible, and when I'm disciplined to train myself for godliness, that is
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:44.100]   the expression of God's work in my life, even though I am the one who is waking
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:51.580]   up in the morning. Moises Silva gives this explanation of the balance. He says,
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:56.580]   "Sanctification requires discipline, concentration, and effort, as is clear by
[00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:01.820]   the many exhortations of Scripture, especially those where the Christian
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.660]   life is described with such figures as running and fighting. On the other hand,
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:12.780]   men must always resist the temptation to assume that they in effect sanctify
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:18.140]   themselves, that spiritual power comes from within them, and that they may
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:26.060]   therefore rely on their own strength." Silva acknowledges this is a difficult
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:33.540]   tension, though no more puzzling than the paradox of prayer. Yet perhaps the real
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:39.980]   secret of holiness consists precisely in learning to keep that balance, relying
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:46.180]   thoroughly on God as the true agent in sanctification, while faithfully
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:52.260]   discharging one's personal responsibility. I'm reminded of John
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:59.500]   MacArthur's statement that he lives his life in a state of relaxed desperation. I
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:07.460]   like that statement. Relaxed desperation. He is relaxed because he knows that it
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:13.620]   is all up to God. He has a sense of desperation because he understands what
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:20.980]   is at stake in every situation, and there is that difficult tension of fulfilling
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:26.980]   my responsibility before the Lord, and then in the end, leaving it up to God and
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:34.420]   trusting Him for the results. So that leads me to truth number four, and we'll
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:39.980]   conclude with this. The believer's pursuit of sanctification is evidence of
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:48.540]   God's work in that believer. In the end, here's the reason why you need to
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:58.860]   understand this doctrine. In the end, God receives all the glory for every step in
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:05.900]   our progress toward Christlikeness. In the end, it's not about how hard I worked,
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:10.060]   or how much I was disciplined, or how much I progressed. In the end, it is about
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:17.100]   see how faithful God has been to me, and see how God has been faithful to
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:22.220]   complete the work He began in me. And this brings us back to the key passages
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:28.380]   I introduced at the beginning of this session. Philippians 2 verse 12, "Therefore
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:34.700]   my beloved, as you've always obeyed, so now not only as in my presence, but much
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:40.300]   more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:46.460]   is God who works in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure." That one
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:52.700]   statement guards against both quietism and pietism in the view of
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:59.420]   sanctification. And 1 Corinthians 15 verse 10 says, "By the grace of God, I am
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.260]   what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:09.340]   harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:16.620]   me." John Murray puts it this way, "God's working in us is not suspended because
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:22.860]   we work, nor our working suspended because God works. God works in us, and we
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:30.220]   also work. But the relation is that because God works, we work. All working
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:36.220]   out of salvation on our part is the effect of God's working in us, not the
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.060]   willing to the exclusion of the doing and not the doing to the exclusion of
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:47.180]   the willing, but both the willing and the doing. And this working of God is
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:54.380]   directed to the end of enabling us to will and to do that which is pleasing to
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:01.260]   Him." Jonathan Edwards says, "We are not merely passive in it, nor yet does God
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:09.980]   do some and we do the rest, but God does all," and note this, "we do all. God
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:19.500]   produces all, and we act all, for that is what He produces, our own acts. God's
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:29.500]   only proper author and foundation, we only are the proper actors." Sanctification
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:35.660]   is a sovereign work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit uses means to sanctify the
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:43.100]   believer. We are called to diligently pursue sanctification, yet that pursuit
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:49.260]   is evidence of God's work in us. I hope you will see the necessity of having a
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:56.780]   full and robust understanding of the doctrine of progressive sanctification,
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:02.940]   synergistic sanctification, not only understanding the big picture of past
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:07.100]   sanctification, we have been sanctified, future sanctification, we will be
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:16.460]   sanctified, but present day we are in the process of being sanctified, and I pray
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:23.260]   that you will live in the confidence that as you pursue sanctification in the
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:29.740]   Lord, that God will finish the work that He began in you, that you'll be equipped
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:36.220]   to address both pietism on one hand and the anxious toil of some who believe
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:41.820]   that spirituality is all dependent upon their efforts, and that you will also be
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:47.900]   equipped to address quietism, a passive approach to sanctification which is
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:55.820]   unbiblical and produces no fruit. And I do pray that in each of our lives that
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:06:02.700]   by the power of the Spirit we will grow in holiness, we will overcome sin, that we
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:08.460]   will become more like Christ, and so we will be effective instruments in the
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:15.500]   Redeemer's hands to lead others and to minister to others as they deal with
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:23.740]   battles in their own sanctification. And so, write a good essay here. Just a
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.900]   note there, I did spend some time giving, I hope, a gracious critique on
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:33.100]   synergistic sanctification, the term there, but please just use that as
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:37.420]   background. That's not really the main thrust of this essay. I think the main
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:42.540]   thrust of this essay are found in the four truths regarding sanctification, and
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:47.820]   if you handle those well, you'll guard against both quietism and pietism. And I
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:54.620]   think what ACBC is really wanting you to do is to describe both sides of
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:07:00.540]   sanctification being completely the work of God and also the side of our calling
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:06.060]   to be working out our salvation with fear and trembling. So I trust that you'll
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:12.540]   write a great essay on this topic. Let me end with the words of 1 Peter 5,
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:17.500]   verse 10, which says, "And after you have suffered a little while, the God of
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:23.340]   grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore,
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:31.740]   confirm, strengthen, and establish you. To him be dominion forever and ever. Amen."
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:37.900]   Let me close us in prayer. Father, thank you for this study. Thank you for the
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:45.340]   truth that you are at work in our lives. Thank you that you have sanctified us,
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:52.300]   you are sanctifying us, and you will sanctify us. And so, Father, help us to be
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:59.900]   faithful to our responsibility to actively fight the good fight of faith,
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:04.060]   to discipline ourselves for the purpose of godliness,
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:10.780]   to diligently and faithfully devote ourselves to the means of grace,
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:15.420]   which the Holy Spirit uses to make us more like Christ.
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:22.620]   I pray for our counseling ministries, that they would be filled with counselors
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:30.540]   who are sanctified, that ACBC as an organization would have a reputation
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.740]   of producing counselors who are like Christ,
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:38.380]   who repent of sin, who bear the fruit of the Spirit,
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:46.300]   and that there would be an undeniable reality to our spiritual lives,
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:50.540]   so that those who are in need would want to come
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:55.100]   to see a counselor who is filled with the fruit of the Spirit, who
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:09:03.020]   not just dispenses correct information, but who is able to minister out of a
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.700]   living, vital relationship with Christ. We can't
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.500]   do this on our own. We can only plead for your grace and
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:15.100]   ask you to do this work in our lives.
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:18.540]   So, I thank you for our time of study. Thank you for each of my brothers and
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:23.340]   sisters who've devoted this hour to us, and we pray that you would
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:28.380]   bear fruit through this time. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:34.780]   Well, amen. Well, hey, have a great rest of the week. God bless you.
