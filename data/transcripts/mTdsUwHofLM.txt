[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Is there any possibility that he was leaking information to the Soviets or in some way
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.640]   helping the Soviet program? He was a communist empathizer, right?
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.640]   He had been during the 1930s, but less for the theory, if you will, than for the practical
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.040]   business of helping Jews escape from Nazi Germany. One of the loves of his life, who was
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.160]   busy working on extracting Jews from Europe during the '30s as well, was a member of the
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.480]   Communist Party, Jean Tadlock. And she, I think, encouraged him to come to meetings.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.640]   But I don't think there's any possibility whatsoever that he either shared information
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.800]   or was in any way affiliated. In fact, he said he read Marx on a train trip,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.440]   people traveled by train in those days, between Berkeley and Washington one time and thought it
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.480]   was a bunch of hooey. Just ridiculous. He was a very smart man and he read the book with an eye
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.320]   to its logic and he didn't think there was much there. So I think you have to see him as, you
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.800]   know, he really didn't know anything about human beings and their struggles. He was born into
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.400]   considerable wealth. There were Impressionist paintings all over his family apartments in New
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.240]   York City. His father had made a great deal of money cornering the market, so to speak, on
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.080]   uniform linings for military uniforms during and before the First World War. So there was a lot of
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.480]   wealth. I think his income, if I remember and if I'm right in this, when he was during the war years
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.600]   and before, was somewhere around $100,000 a month. And that's a lot of money in the 1930s.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.760]   So he just lived in his head for most of his early, early years until he got to Berkeley
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.960]   and discovered that prime students of his were living on cat food. I mean, you know,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.880]   cans of god-awful cat food because they couldn't afford anything else. And once he understood that
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.920]   there was great suffering in the world, he jumped in on it as he always did when he
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.600]   became interested in something. So all of those things come together. I do think his brother,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.200]   well, there's no question that his brother, Frank, was a member of the party, as was Frank's wife.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.160]   And the whole question of Oppenheimers lying to the security people during the Second World War,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.200]   which he did, about who approached him and who was maybe trying to get him to sign on to some
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   espionage, I think was primarily an effort to cover up his brother's involvement. Not that his
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.920]   brothers gave away any secrets. I don't think he did. But if the Army security had really understood
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.680]   Frank Oppenheimer's involvement, he probably would have been shipped off to the Aleutians
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.200]   or some other distant place for the duration of the war. And Oppenheimer,
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   quite correctly, wanted Frank around. He was someone he trusted.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.840]   you
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
