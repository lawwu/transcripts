[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, working at DG comes with a wonderful fringe benefit.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I get to take in a lot of devotionals led by you, Pastor John.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   These are off-air, private devotionals created as preludes to DG staff meetings and leadership team meetings.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   A lot of these devotional times together are an overflow from your huge investment in "Look at the Book,"
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   your video series doodling on Bible texts.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And one of those recent DG devotionals struck me.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   You were leading us on spiritual warfare and taking us through the armor of God in Ephesians chapter 6.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And you stopped at Ephesians chapter 6, verse 12, where Paul reminds us that our enemies are not flesh and blood.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Our enemy is a spiritual being, the devil and his forces.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   That is our true enemy. And yet our enemy strikes at us through flesh and blood,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   a point that you made from Ephesians 4, verse 14.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   So can you walk us through the logical connections that you made that our enemy is not flesh and blood,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   but he works through flesh and blood? Explain that.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   So I was working my way through Ephesians 6 with "Look at the Book," and I got to chapter 6, verses 10 through 12.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And what stopped me, puzzled me, at least at first, was not the affirmation that we have supernatural adversaries,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   but the apparent denial that we have human adversaries.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   That was the "What?"
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Here's what he says.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   "Finally be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil."
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And then comes the denial.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   "For we do not wrestle against blood and flesh."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And by the way, that is the right order. It's usually translated in English versions "flesh and blood,"
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   but there are two places, one in Hebrews and one here, where it's reversed.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Blood and flesh. And I'll come back to that. I think it's significant.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   "We do not wrestle against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   against the cosmic powers over the present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places."
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   So for me, the question is not, do we have a supernatural demonic adversary?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   We certainly do. But what does Paul mean when he says, "We do not wrestle against blood and flesh"?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And ordinarily, those two words, blood and flesh or flesh and blood, simply mean human, just human reality,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   considered apart from any special work of God's saving grace, just what we are by fallen nature.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   That's flesh and blood or blood and flesh.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So it sounds like Paul is saying, "We don't wrestle against ordinary fallen humans."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And the problem is that Paul himself, even in the same book, describes such human adversaries.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Chapter 4, verse 13, he tells us, "Don't be children tossed to and fro by human cunning,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   by craftiness in deceitful schemes."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So you almost have the exact same words, you know, demonic schemes and this human cunning
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   in the craftiness of deceitful schemes.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And so what in the world is going on?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   In 6.12, he says, "We don't wrestle against blood and flesh, but against the schemes of the devil."
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And in 4.14, he says, "Don't be carried about by human cunning or deceitful schemes."
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Now, Paul is a lot smarter than I am.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   That's an understatement.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And he is inspired by the Holy Spirit in what he says.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And so I am getting low here and assuming that these two texts from the inspired apostle
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   do not contradict each other.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And he means for us to figure out how they fit together.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So here are some relevant texts that inform my solution.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Ephesians 2, 1 following, "You were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you once walked,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   carrying out the desires of the body and the mind,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and were by nature children of wrath like the rest of mankind.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   So all fallen, unregenerate humans walk or live, quote, "according to,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   in step with the prince of the power of the air, Satan."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   But that reality of being in step with the devil, all of us, before we're set free by the gospel,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   that reality of walking in step with, in sync with, on the frequency of the devil as sons of disobedience
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   does not mean we are pawns who have no accountability.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Because he says we are walking in sins and trespasses that we are committing
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   and that we are children of wrath.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   In other words, we are blameworthy. We deserve judgment, God's holy wrath.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   So I take this to mean that the devil taps into our natural sinfulness
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   in a way that influences us profoundly, but does so in a way that does not take away
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   our accountability or our guilt before God.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Paul describes human sinfulness in chapter 4 of Ephesians, verse 18, like this.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "They are," meaning they, Gentiles, humans, "they are darkened in their understanding,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   and the bottom is here, due to the hardness of their heart."
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   In other words, he traces the problem of our guilt and our sin down to the hardness of our own heart.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   No mention of the devil. None. We are our own condemning problem.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Then, when you watch Paul seek to save and sanctify sinful people in Ephesians,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   you don't see any exorcisms, no power encounters. What you see is he speaks straight to us
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   with gospel implications. "Let the thief no longer steal, but let him labor,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   doing honest work with his own hands so that he can have something to give.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   by which you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you." And he goes on and on,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   just speaking directly to us, to our minds, to our hearts, to our wills.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   In fact, he says the great challenge for Christians is that we are new creatures
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   in Christ by faith, and we need to put off the old self and put on the new self.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Paul's whole approach to helping Christians fight for holiness
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   almost never mentions the devil. Not surprising, since three of the six pieces of spiritual armor
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   are truth, gospel, and word of God. And those are all things that Paul speaks
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   directly into the human mind and the human heart. He doesn't speak those things
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   to the devil, he speaks them to people. In 2 Corinthians 5.11, Paul says,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   "Knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men." That's what he did.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   He went around the world persuading human beings. He didn't have this excessive
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   demon orientation. He didn't walk into synagogues and cast out demons.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He walked into synagogues and argued about the Old Testament.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   We speak directly to men. We don't do an end run around human mind or human heart
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   to try to attack the devil. The warfare for the souls of men is fought with truth
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   and gospel and word of God, speaking directly to men, not Satan,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   all the while praying in the spirit for supernatural power.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Now, even though Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4.4, "The God of this world has blinded
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   the minds of unbelievers," nevertheless, Paul's response to satanic blinding
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   is not to speak to Satan, but to speak directly to responsible, guilty,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   blinded human beings with the gospel while praying down the power of God.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   For example, in Acts 26.17, Jesus says to Paul, "I am sending you to open their eyes."
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   You, Paul. "I'm sending you to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Paul preaches the gospel straight to humans, and God uses the gospel
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   in the power of the Holy Spirit to set people free from satanic blindness.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Same thing in 2 Timothy 2.26. Paul teaches the truth to people,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   and then it says, "God may perhaps grant them repentance and escape from the snare of the devil."
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   So here's my conclusion about what Paul means when he says,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   "We don't wrestle with blood and flesh." Two things.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Number one, he means there is no such thing as a merely human adversary of the gospel.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   They don't exist. While this world is under the sway of the evil one, 1 John 5.19,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   the whole world lies under the evil one. While that's the case, unbelieving humans
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   are always influenced by and in step with the devil.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   We don't wrestle against mere human forces because there aren't any.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Number two, I think he mentions blood first in the pair.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   We don't wrestle against blood and flesh because he's drawing our attention to the fact
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   that this warfare is not like the ordinary battlefield of warfare among people marked by blood and gore.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   That's not what he's talking about, in other words. We don't fight like that.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   It's not a matter of chopping off arms or heads and blood and flesh.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Our warfare is always fought at a level that includes the supernatural.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Yeah, amen. Very insightful. Thank you for leading us through that, Pastor John.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And thank you for your look at the book videos. It's a wonderful teaching resource.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Really appreciate it. And thanks for your DG devotionals as well.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Thank you for listening today. You can ask a question of your own.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   You can search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   You can do all that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Well, Monday, we are back to hear from a disabled mother to two small kids.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   She reads Proverbs 31, the valiant woman, the diligent wife, up early, late to bed,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   endlessly busy inside and outside the house, and she physically can't do it.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So how can she be a faithful mother when Proverbs 31 is so far beyond what she can achieve
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   due to her physical limitations? You do not want to miss this one.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, Pastor John, and I will see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Have a great weekend.
