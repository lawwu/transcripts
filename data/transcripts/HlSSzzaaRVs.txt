[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.240]   - Welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.280]   I am here with Lana Rhodes.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.520]   Yeah, so people are gonna be surprised
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.880]   that we're on a podcast together,
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880]   but I actually came across one of your podcasts
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880]   that you used to do,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.720]   'cause I was messing with one of your friends,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.960]   and she sent me the podcast,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840]   and you were talking about just the dark sides
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.360]   of the adult film industry and the porn industry,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.160]   which you used to be a part of,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.840]   and it really just, I was really interested,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.760]   and honestly, inspired by your story.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.560]   So that's kinda why I wanna have you on,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.560]   and I appreciate you being vulnerable
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.200]   and coming on the podcast.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.680]   - No, thank you, that's so sweet.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.640]   - Yeah, no, for sure.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.460]   So let's start off just with your childhood.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.280]   I feel like a lot of people who end up
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.880]   in the sex industry at all kinda have
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.640]   an unorthodox kinda upbringing.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.720]   Was yours a usual upbringing, or how'd that go growing up?
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.120]   - So there's a lot of things
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.400]   that I've come to terms with recently
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.960]   that I didn't even realize were wrong in my childhood.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.280]   Like the past year, I have started going to therapy,
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.960]   and I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.200]   and I've been through so many things
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.160]   that I was like, oh, maybe this caused it,
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.760]   or this caused it.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.420]   And the one thing that really,
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.840]   I feel like if you don't have borderline BPD,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600]   you won't understand the feeling.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.000]   But basically, to figure it out,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.680]   I had to go back and think when was the first time
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.640]   that I had this feeling that no one loves me,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.520]   and just overwhelming emotions to the point
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.040]   where it feels like you have to hurt yourself in some way.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   And so that came from just like when you're a young child,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.980]   and you're developing your attachment to parents
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.480]   or emotional regulation skills,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.160]   if people invalidate you, like say you're crying,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.200]   and your parents yell at you to make you stop
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.760]   or they hit you, and I'm talking two, three years old,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.740]   obviously, you should never hit your kids.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.280]   It can cause that, and I just had no idea.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.320]   I actually thought that everyone's parents hit them,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.640]   and I really thought that.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.760]   I thought maybe it just started young doing it,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.320]   and I asked a couple of my friends,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.680]   I was like, how old were you when your parents hit you
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.520]   for the first time?
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.020]   And they were like, what, my parents never hit me?
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.880]   So there's just a lot,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.400]   and then I have a sister who has schizophrenia too.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   So I feel like I wasn't dealt the best hand of cards
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.060]   when it comes to family circumstances,
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.460]   which definitely contributed to the decisions
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.080]   that I made when I was older,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.520]   because if your brain is just completely warped
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.040]   from going through so much,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.000]   going through certain things can actually change
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.400]   your brain chemistry.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.240]   - 100%, yeah.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.160]   - And damage it.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   And so I don't think that I would've made the decisions
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.160]   that I made if I was in a better state of mind,
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.840]   because I only was in the industry
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   for a short period of time,
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.360]   and that was because I finally was able to get away
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.960]   from where I was living, and be separated,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.600]   and live my own life, and experience the world,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.440]   and kind of heal, 'cause I wasn't in that constant.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.320]   - Right, did you have your father around, or no?
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.920]   - No, so my parents got divorced
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.240]   when my mom was pregnant with me.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.720]   - Gotcha. - Yeah.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.640]   - So yeah, obviously growing up was tough.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.460]   I had a woman on the podcast
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.860]   who also, she kind of ended up in the industry.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.040]   She actually was trafficked,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.440]   and she had a similar childhood.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.160]   I don't think she had a father figure around,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.480]   and her upbringing wasn't the best,
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.040]   and it led her to hanging around some people,
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.800]   and idolizing certain things,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.320]   and she ended up in a really messed up situation.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   So you go through that childhood,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   and then I think your teenage years
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.760]   is when you kind of started getting into the industry.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.000]   How did that kind of unfold?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.440]   What was the steps that you took to even get into that?
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   - Well, yeah, it was kind of a progressive ladder effect.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.040]   I started out working at a restaurant
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.680]   similar to Hooters when I was 17.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.840]   And it's not that I don't know my dad at all.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.600]   I just don't spend a lot of time with him,
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.520]   but he signed the paper so that I could work there,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.280]   because it's a restaurant where you have to wear
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.420]   a sexy outfit, and I wasn't even 18.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.360]   So that was my first kind of job
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.040]   where men sexualize you and look at you in that way,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.880]   and I never thought that I was pretty
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.080]   or anything growing up.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.480]   So I was like, wow, they hired me here.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.480]   I'm pretty enough to work here.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.960]   And then guys coming up to me and giving me $20
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.880]   and being like, you're so hot, here's $20.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.320]   It was just like, it was so weird to me,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.040]   but also validating, 'cause I didn't have that self-esteem.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.000]   So I kind of went further down the rabbit hole.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.840]   When I turned 18, I left that job,
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.960]   and I went straight to becoming a dancer at a club.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.880]   And then after that, it was porn.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.720]   - Right.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.440]   And I don't want to spend too much time
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.980]   kind of in that period of your life,
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.480]   which is a very brief period.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.560]   I think total, you said you filmed around eight months?
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.160]   - Yeah, like two four-month stints.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.240]   - Gotcha.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.760]   What I really kind of want to get at is
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.640]   the fact that in terms of being a porn star,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.680]   you had everything that any girl in that industry would want.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.000]   You got the fame, you got the popularity,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.400]   probably were making more money than most girls.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.880]   And you kind of threw that all away,
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.160]   and now are kind of an advocate against a lot of this stuff.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.880]   And you speak openly, and you're very passionate
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.680]   about kind of what goes on in the dark sides
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.640]   of the porn industry and how it's not,
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.560]   everything kind of isn't as it seems.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.720]   So what kind of brought about your change in perspective?
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.680]   - Just, I actually had an experience last,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.920]   so I started doing OnlyFans again.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.600]   And I had an experience last night with another girl
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.400]   that reminded me of how I felt in those times.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.440]   So it's like, I actually couldn't sleep last night
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.080]   'cause I was just so hurt by this happening.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.920]   Me and one of my good girlfriends,
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.440]   we went live on OnlyFans last night,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   and I just recognized this facial expression that she had
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.840]   that she looked so uncomfortable.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.920]   And this was our third time doing it.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.520]   We're friends, we kiss off camera and stuff.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.840]   So I wasn't expecting it, but I was like, "Are you okay?
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.760]   "Are you comfortable?"
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.120]   And she's like, "I just have anxiety."
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.480]   And then she went off to the side and started just bawling.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.920]   And I turned the live off, and it's just such,
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.800]   like, I feel honestly destroyed
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   that I even had any part in someone feeling
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.120]   not comfortable with what they were doing.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.880]   And also, she was explaining to me
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.920]   that she needs to make money for certain things,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.400]   so she feels like she doesn't say no
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.600]   to all the things that she would want to.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.920]   And it's probably good that this experience happened with me
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   because I have been through that so much myself
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.280]   that I was able to give her really good advice,
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.440]   even though it's something that literally killed me inside
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.320]   to be part of.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.160]   But that's essentially what it was.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.640]   It's a bunch of really young girls
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.080]   who get into the industry.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.160]   The younger, the better for them.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.720]   These girls, when I started, I looked like a little kid.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.120]   I looked like a little kid.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.920]   And that's what they like.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.600]   That's what sells.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.200]   And a lot of girls, even my friends,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.720]   we don't feel comfortable saying no for some reason.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.280]   'Cause we just, I don't know,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.160]   it's just like a natural girl thing.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.160]   I think we're taught as children to be obedient,
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.640]   especially to men.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.040]   Or if you're raised in a religious family,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.240]   it's always like, obey your father, stuff like that.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.000]   And so it's a really big problem
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.960]   with girls feeling pressured by agents
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   who don't necessarily have their best interest in mind.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.680]   And I'm doing a lot of things that really hurt them.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.320]   For me, there are certain scenes that I did
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   that I felt like I didn't say anything to them
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.040]   because it's work and I wanted to be professional.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.600]   But for example, when the camera would be behind me
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.480]   and you couldn't see my face,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.640]   I would be gagging or crying
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.880]   because I felt like I was being raped
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.040]   because I did not want to be doing it.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.640]   And I didn't wanna be feeling
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.800]   the things in my body that I was feeling
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.320]   'cause I was honestly disgusted
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.520]   by the person that I was having to shoot with
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.400]   'cause you don't get to choose.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.040]   So it's just stuff like that that can be very damaging.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.600]   And it's not the other people's fault.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.720]   It's just a huge problem
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   that there's not really anything to set up
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.800]   to protect girls that are young and vulnerable
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.560]   that don't know how to say no
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.240]   or don't have self-respect for themselves yet
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.200]   or care for themselves or love themselves
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.640]   because they've been through so much and taught not to.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.360]   - And I feel like a lot of people,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.200]   I don't know if you guys received the backlash,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.240]   like, "Oh, you guys chose to do this," or whatever.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.720]   But when you're in your teenage years
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.040]   and then you're around these older men,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.120]   I'm sure they're all older.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.440]   - Yeah, they're all in their 40s.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.600]   They know exactly how to get you to do what you want,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.520]   what they want, to make them money.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.480]   - And then you guys don't even really make much, I'm sure.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.600]   - No, it's pickles.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.920]   I was the number one porn star
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.040]   and my rate was $1,200 for a sex scene.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.760]   - Yeah. - $1,200.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.800]   - That's unbelievable.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.200]   - But obviously a lot of these girls
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.920]   are coming from small towns.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.960]   Their families probably don't have money.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.120]   I thought $100 at the time was so much money.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.600]   So getting 1,200 was a big deal.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.640]   But then I met this boy who worked in,
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.280]   not the guy that I ended up dating for a long time,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.720]   but I met this other boy that worked in YouTube and Instagram
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.440]   and he shared with me that he was getting $15,000
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.120]   to pose with a Jeep on Instagram.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.400]   And I was like, "I'm getting $1,200 for a sex scene?
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.840]   This is not okay."
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.560]   - Yeah, and I think that's one thing like this industry,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.880]   like it continues to take off, you know, as time goes on,
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.440]   you know, more people are exposed to it at a younger age.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.600]   It's like, like porn is a real life addiction
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.880]   for a lot of people, but a lot of these young men
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.360]   that are introduced to it, they don't really know
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.720]   kind of behind the scenes what you guys deal with.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.880]   They look at these girls on camera and think like,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.560]   oh, they're enjoying it, this is what they like,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.840]   this is, you know, whatever.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.080]   And I think that it's important for people like you,
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.040]   especially super successful people like you
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.680]   that decided to leave, like to kind of educate young men.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.640]   And I guess young women now, I saw a lot of young women
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.200]   watch porn too, but just, it's not, that's not what it is.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.800]   It's not, it's glamorous and it's not like these,
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.720]   it's not what it appears to be, kind of.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.760]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.560]   It was like, you could probably could not tell at all
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.480]   that I felt the way that I did in the certain scenes
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.360]   because it's a job, it's acting.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.880]   And like, I had like pre-planned things
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.520]   that I was going to say during the scenes,
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.120]   like facial expressions that I was gonna make,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.760]   things that I was gonna do because it's fake, it's fake.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.120]   And I also think like the point that you made
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.400]   that the guys don't understand
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.040]   what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.320]   And then also that people are like,
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.720]   oh, you knew what you got into,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.400]   and like you get backlash for talking out about it.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.960]   I think it's because men like consuming porn
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.400]   and they don't wanna feel guilty for consuming it.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.160]   And so they don't wanna hear that I felt
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.600]   the way that I felt.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.360]   And they refuse to believe that I'm not like a giant whore
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.560]   that wants to get like fucked by like a bunch of big dicks.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.720]   Like I'm the biggest prude in real life.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.120]   - How did you, did you,
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.720]   because I know a lot of women that are in that industry,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.120]   it's very hard to get out,
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.000]   or like you almost feel like you're stuck.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.840]   And even the girls that do,
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.400]   sometimes the only way out to them may seem like suicide.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.360]   Like I saw a stat on your podcast
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.000]   where it was like the average life expectancy
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.880]   of someone in the sex industry for a woman is about 37.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.160]   And the average life expectancy
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.640]   outside of that industry is 78, I think.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.160]   And I was just like, how is that possible?
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.960]   So a lot of, obviously a lot of these girls
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.600]   feel like there's no way out.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.000]   How were you able to kind of get out
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.720]   and kind of just like, I guess,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.560]   find your identity outside of the industry?
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.840]   - I mean, I had to,
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.760]   or it probably would have led to that point
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.440]   of like killing myself.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.960]   'Cause I started like towards the end of it,
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.920]   I started having panic attacks, like before scenes,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.200]   'cause I really didn't wanna do them.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.080]   And I didn't know how to say, no, I don't wanna do this.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.640]   So there really was no choice for me.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.600]   It was either like probably going to kill myself
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   or just do anything to like make something else work.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.080]   And this is what I was telling my friend last night,
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.160]   'cause she was saying that she's not really happy
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.040]   with doing OnlyFans anymore.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.000]   And I'm like, she has other passions
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.880]   that she's interested in.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.760]   I really believe anyone,
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.600]   if they just work towards anything that they wanna do,
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   just a little bit every single day, like you can get there.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.240]   Just 'cause a lot of people aren't willing
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.360]   to like work every single day and put in the effort.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.800]   But if you do, it really does pay off.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.640]   When I quit porn,
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.880]   I only had like 200,000 followers on Instagram.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.480]   And I met this boy and I was like, okay,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.760]   I wanna do what he does.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.880]   I wanna be an Instagram influencer.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.720]   And I grew my account to over 10 million in one year,
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.280]   just by literally asking all my friends,
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   hey, can you take a picture of me today?
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.080]   Hey, can you help me with this?
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.520]   And just always posting, like working on my Instagram.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.440]   And then I started getting brand deals,
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.800]   which sustained me so that I didn't have to do any sex work.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.240]   And then it just progressed over time
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.040]   with the stuff that I do.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.120]   Like I ended up doing YouTube with my boyfriend,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.560]   then a podcast, and now I'm doing fashion.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.320]   So I really think like it doesn't really make sense
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.240]   where I came from in porn to where I am now.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.160]   And I think it's really just believing that you can
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.600]   and putting in effort every single day to get there.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.400]   - Yeah, I mean, I find that kind of inspiring
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.800]   because I know a lot of people,
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.760]   you hear the term selling yourself for fame or money,
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.240]   whatever, but like the fact that you were
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.000]   the number one porn star,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.200]   and then you chose to kind of like let all that go.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.680]   Like I know I've talked to some rappers who do the music,
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.000]   and they talk about how they don't really want
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.160]   to be making the type of music they do.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.440]   They don't wanna talk about the violence or the whatever.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.640]   They would rather be a positive message.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.360]   But the reason that they talk about these things
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.400]   is because it sells.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.880]   And they're making a lot of money,
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.280]   and they know if they change their message or whatever,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.080]   they wouldn't be as successful.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.040]   And it's similar in your story,
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   because you were doing all that,
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.160]   but you decided to step down from that
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.440]   and try to find ways to make money
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.840]   or find your identity outside of porn.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.760]   I feel like that obviously takes a big like leap of faith,
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.240]   and it's just very hard to do
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.600]   when you kind of have become something,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.720]   but you wanna completely shift away from it.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.560]   So I admire you for that.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.400]   - Thank you.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.360]   - And that's kind of why I wanted to talk to you about this.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.080]   But yeah, I think one thing that my sister mentioned
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.200]   was as this porn industry kind of increases,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.640]   you also see like an increase in just the human trafficking,
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.480]   the sex trafficking as well,
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.840]   which I find that to be like,
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.780]   I mean, it's probably pretty obvious
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.200]   why they grow together, but have you seen that?
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.120]   Can you speak on that?
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.400]   Or why do you think the rise in porn
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.160]   also equals the rise in the human trafficking?
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.720]   How do those kind of collide together?
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.120]   - I personally haven't like experienced human trafficking,
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.920]   or the closest like that I've ever been
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.320]   to meeting someone who has was,
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.560]   I went to Juvie when I was a teen,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.780]   and really like, it's really sad.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.820]   There are some of the most beautiful,
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.140]   amazing girls that I met in there,
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.500]   and they were like 12 years old,
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.660]   and like their parents had been like pimping them out
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.220]   since they were like 11.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.600]   And like this one girl looked like a model.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.900]   She was so beautiful.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.360]   And like, this was happening to her
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.260]   because her parents did dope.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.740]   And so they were pimping out their 11 year old daughter.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.280]   And I remember at one point she like,
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.720]   like there was like something on her butt or something,
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.480]   and like, she wanted me to look at it.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.920]   And like, she bent over and she didn't have like underwear on
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.640]   and like, because if girls like get raped very young
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.880]   or like have to have sex, it can like ruin their vagina.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.120]   And it was just like, I felt so bad for her
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.960]   'cause she was only 12 and it looked like
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.360]   just, I don't know, it's hard.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   But that's the closest experience that I've had with that.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.640]   And I'm not like too educated on what's going on with.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.120]   - Gotcha. - Yeah.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.760]   - Gotcha, now I was just curious about that.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.600]   So what advice would you then give to,
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.040]   so I guess a lot of girls are then going into this industry
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.400]   obviously by free will.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.320]   So what advice, you know, being where you are now
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.480]   and seeing what you've seen,
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.200]   what advice would you then give girls
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.640]   who are considering going into the industry?
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.680]   - There's a few things.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.520]   One, my experience and other girls' experiences
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.280]   may be different.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.240]   Like I know people, girls,
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.700]   who supposedly really like doing it.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.100]   And like, that's fine for them to like doing it.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.320]   The difference between me and those girls that I've noticed
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.260]   is that before I did porn, I was only with one guy.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.240]   Like I didn't hook up with people.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.640]   I still like have to be in love with someone
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.600]   to want to like be physical with them.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.360]   And the other girls before they did porn,
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.640]   the ones who like tend to like it more,
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   it's because they're already doing like gang bangs
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.800]   in their personal life
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.520]   or like being very sexually active already.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.560]   And so it like makes more sense to them.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.840]   - They were like already fucked.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.700]   - Yeah, they were already doing it.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.660]   And so they're like, why not make money off of it?
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.260]   And it's something that they enjoy supposedly.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:21.260]   I mean, I'm sure like some of them have had like days
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.580]   on set that didn't go well.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.780]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.420]   Do you feel like, so then what do you think contributes
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.300]   to the girls who end up in that industry
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.360]   doing so many drugs or the suicide rates?
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.420]   Why do you feel like that is so high then?
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.280]   Do you just feel like there's a lot of girls
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.300]   that do feel like you or do you just feel like,
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.980]   yeah, what do you think happens?
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.940]   - Kind of going back to like what happened
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.340]   with my friend last night.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.580]   She didn't want to be doing it,
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.260]   but she felt like she needed money.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.980]   And so like the piece of advice that I gave her was just,
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.020]   if there's a piece of yourself
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.000]   that you don't feel like you can give,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.440]   don't give it for anything
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.860]   because that's gonna end up like fucking you up
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.580]   so bad in the long run.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.140]   Like, I know because I gave way too much of myself
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.740]   that I didn't want to.
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.740]   And like no money is worth doing that really.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.720]   And I imagine like the girls wanting to kill themselves
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.440]   or like taking drugs, like even just to deal with it,
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.240]   like to do the scenes maybe
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.500]   if they don't wanna be doing it
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.620]   so they can like disassociate
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.440]   'cause they just need to like make money
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.860]   to sustain themselves at that point.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.700]   And also like if your body,
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.820]   it's just not natural for people, I think,
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.300]   to be having sex with people that they don't know
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.400]   and that they're not attracted to.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.240]   And also like, even if you do like doing sex work,
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.460]   there might be a day where you don't like having sex
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.300]   or you don't wanna be sexual
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.280]   and you still have to do it anyway.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.280]   So it's a bit traumatizing to share your body in that way
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.480]   'cause it's such an intimate thing.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.320]   - Right.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.560]   - And it's just not natural to be doing--
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.780]   - No, 100% agree.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.500]   - That stuff's like, imagine like you just meet someone
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.020]   in the lobby and like you're not attracted to them at all.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.060]   And it's like, okay, now you have to,
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.020]   you have to fuck them and pretend that you like it.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.880]   - Right, no, that's definitely--
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.340]   - It's awful.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.740]   - It's crazy, no, this is definitely crazy to think about.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.440]   It's definitely, I mean, I think it's something
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.040]   obviously more intimate.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.600]   But I think, you know, I'm sure guys in the industry,
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.000]   they don't, they probably don't process stuff
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.200]   the way females do.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.400]   Like they're in their, living their best life, probably.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.920]   - That's, so some of them,
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.920]   so like maybe when they first got into it,
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.360]   but a lot of them do have problems too.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.560]   Like there's like these injections
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.360]   that guys have to do before the scenes.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.400]   Like they can't even get hard anymore.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.020]   - Right, yeah, I didn't hear about that.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.800]   - Yeah, so they have to like shoot up their dick
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.720]   with some sort of stimulant, I don't know what it is.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.240]   Or I did date one guy when I was in the porn industry
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.560]   who was like a director and he performed in his own scenes.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.880]   And they get, which I've seen this with like celebrity men
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.800]   too that have hooked up with a lot of girls.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.680]   They get so like numb to just regular sex
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.600]   or just women that they end up having like these
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.620]   like really intense fetishes 'cause they can't like get off
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.020]   to normal things anymore.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.620]   Like I've met guys who liked being peed on,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.380]   who buy cookies with poop in them off the internet
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.340]   and watch those pooping.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.820]   - Honestly I know what you're talking about
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.700]   because I, even in the NBA, like you talk about,
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.900]   and this is why I think like porn is dangerous,
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.620]   but also hooking up with too many people
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.740]   and because you get desensitized to the normal thing.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.780]   And this happens in the NBA.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.580]   Like I hear wild stories about some of these dudes,
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.420]   but like you said.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.260]   - Oh, trust me.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.180]   (laughing)
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:06.020]   - Other celebrities too that their fetishes get so crazy.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.780]   You know, they might be a straight man,
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.820]   but they've done so much stuff with so many pretty girls
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.340]   and they have so much access to pretty girls
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.380]   that you know, now they're over here messing with trannies
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.220]   or now they're over here--
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.220]   - Or a man.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.740]   - Or now they're over here messing with dudes.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.900]   And it's like, it's crazy to think about.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.300]   And I think, obviously I think the porn industry
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.420]   has a part to play in that because you watch a,
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.620]   you know, when you first get introduced to it,
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.180]   just seeing a girl naked might be enough for you,
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.340]   but then you keep watching it
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.780]   and now you're looking at the craziest things
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.660]   and now normal sex in real life doesn't do it for you.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.300]   - Definitely, and also how old were you
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.100]   the first time that you saw porn?
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.700]   - Man, my mom caught me too.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.660]   (laughing)
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.360]   But I really didn't want, I just looked up,
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.200]   like I think I probably was in like, I don't know,
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.220]   maybe when I was like 11 or 12, maybe 13.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.820]   - So young, so you haven't--
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.300]   - And I just looked up like naked girls
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.140]   or something like that.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.620]   - Yeah, like you like Google boobs or something.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.460]   (laughing)
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.140]   - I was like, all I saw was a naked girl.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.620]   I was like, but then like, yeah, so I understand like--
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.220]   - But imagine like being young
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.460]   and having no sexual experience yourself
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.500]   and then you watch like a porn scene for the first time
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.040]   and then you think that's what sex is,
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.000]   like this like wild performance.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.320]   Like I think one of the first sex scenes I saw
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.120]   was like Sasha Gray and like she was like wild,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.120]   like licking toilet seats, doing like double anal gang bangs
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:41.000]   and so this is what I saw and like I thought
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.240]   when I like first hooked up with my husband,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.260]   which is the only person I slept with before porn,
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.440]   I thought that like how you suck a dick
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.160]   was like what I saw on camera,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.080]   which is like, oh, you have to like deep throat it,
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.840]   like everything that I thought about sex was what I watched,
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.440]   which now I've learned like
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.840]   that's not even what I like at all.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.080]   - Hold on, so you was married before you went into porn?
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:04.920]   - Yeah.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.840]   - So you were married at like what, like 17?
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.920]   - At 18.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.760]   - Oh, wow.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.020]   - I met him a week before I turned 18.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.440]   - Gotcha, that's crazy.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.840]   But now I feel you messes up kind of your perception
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.240]   of what it's supposed to be
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.240]   and even I think these dudes nowadays,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.200]   I mean, obviously some girls are into some crazy things,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.680]   but these dudes that are always watching porn,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.880]   they think that this is always what a girl wants
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.760]   and now they're going to these girls
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.960]   and not knowing really what they actually enjoy
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.160]   and like I said, some of these girls are out here
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.040]   and they're freaks, so they like all this stuff,
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.400]   but not all of them, you know what I mean?
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.200]   So I think it's really detrimental to young men
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.520]   and then if they go and they got a girl
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.120]   and the girl doesn't wanna do this,
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.760]   now they can't even really get off to him.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.480]   Like I know some dudes that would rather watch porn
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.600]   than hook up with their girlfriend
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.400]   because their girlfriend may not do all the things
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.960]   that they're seeing on the screen.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.800]   I feel like that is--
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.620]   - That's actually wild.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.080]   - That is super unhealthy.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.200]   - Yeah, no, that's, also I didn't know
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.160]   how I would feel about that as a girlfriend.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.880]   - Yeah, do you think that's considered,
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.920]   'cause I know a lot of dudes, you know,
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.560]   they might have a wife that's ready in the bedroom,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.160]   but like she's not doing the things that you see on camera,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.120]   so they're going to sneak in the bathroom and watching porn.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.220]   As a woman, do you feel like that would be considered
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.400]   cheating if you were married to a dude?
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.000]   - I personally feel it might also be a BPD thing,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.560]   like 'cause you're very sensitive to rejection,
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.840]   but I do get very upset if I have a partner
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.800]   and for whatever reason they don't wanna,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   they reject me for sex, it makes me spiral.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:44.080]   So I can only imagine if you're a significant other,
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.240]   doesn't wanna like fuck you,
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.840]   and they're more interested in seeing something else,
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.600]   yeah, it would be extremely hurt.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.720]   - Yeah, and I feel like that happens so much nowadays.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.960]   - And like rejected and feeling probably
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.800]   just like shit about yourself.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.520]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.360]   But outside, so like now you obviously
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.600]   have kind of turned your life around
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.800]   and you're not doing that anymore.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   Did it take you a while?
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.520]   I know you talk about how it's super frustrating for you
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.600]   anywhere you walk, anywhere you go,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.360]   people look at you and they see a porn star
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.860]   and you've been out of that for so many years now.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.700]   - Yeah.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.680]   - How do you deal with that?
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.560]   And did it take you a while to not be triggered by that?
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.720]   I know it's probably super frustrating.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.840]   You're doing your thing outside of that industry now,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.160]   but how has that gone for you?
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.800]   - I used to care a lot more than I do.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.780]   Like when I started my podcast with Olivia and Alexa,
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:51.720]   I kind of did it in a way to like make myself,
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.720]   like I wanted to use it in a way to like show people
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.800]   how I actually was or like really like focused
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.080]   on like speaking well to sort of beat the stereotype
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.000]   of like being a dumb porn star.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.680]   Like I used to really, really care what people think
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.760]   and like trying to prove that I wasn't this stereotype.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.320]   And then after, when I got pregnant,
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.520]   like the bullying online got so bad with it
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.960]   that I just became like tuned out to it
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.720]   and I don't give a fuck anymore.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.920]   Like I don't give a shit.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.920]   - I mean, nah, I mean, a lot of athletes
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.760]   have to go through that too.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.600]   So I feel you.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.200]   - Oh, you guys get hella bullied, bullied so bad.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.040]   Like the worst.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.320]   - People talk crazy to us.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.640]   And so I know how that feels.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.440]   And you really eventually reach a point where it's like,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.080]   man, I don't care what these people are talking about.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.120]   - No, you can't.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.520]   - They have no relevance in my life.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.960]   Why are they so concerned what I'm doing?
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.420]   - And also once you start to like truly know who you are
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.640]   and like your morals and values,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.460]   how can they tell you who you are if you know?
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.960]   - How has the, you know, being a mother now,
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.800]   and we talked about this before the podcast,
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.120]   everybody says there's speculations who the baby daddy is.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.240]   And, you know, like.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.080]   - Yeah, people are gonna say you're the baby daddy now.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.760]   They're gonna like put side by side pictures.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.800]   - I know, but like when we were in the playoffs,
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.360]   obviously like my teammate, Bruce,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.080]   who that's who I met you through,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.780]   we were all, we're kicking it somewhere out here in LA.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.080]   But, you know, like during the playoff we would clap,
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.040]   we were just like, bro, your picture, is this your baby?
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.080]   But obviously you probably, I mean,
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.000]   you're keeping that like on the low for a reason.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.960]   But how has being a mother kind of changed your life
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.000]   and changed your perspective?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.780]   Do you feel like, has it helped you?
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.380]   - It's kind of like you win some and you lose some,
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.040]   you know, my pregnancy caused a lot of like health issues
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.480]   that I finally like have gotten under control
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.080]   and like sort of those also diminished my mental health.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.160]   Like probably for the past two years until recently,
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.500]   I was in like the worst mental health state
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.720]   that I'd ever been in.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.560]   However, because I grew up in a house with a sister
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.880]   who was extremely mentally ill
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.080]   and it was like very toxic for me,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.360]   no matter what, I always make sure
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.520]   to never let my son see that.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.480]   And to always make sure that whether I'm depressed
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.740]   and stuck in bed, that he has the best nanny
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.540]   taking him to go and do activities
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.200]   if I can't do that with him,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.880]   or taking him out to dinner.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.080]   Because I, like, I don't want the things
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.120]   that I go through to affect him.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.960]   And I really don't think that they do
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.120]   'cause I'm super careful about it.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.880]   But, sorry, what was the original question?
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.480]   - No, I was just curious how just being a mother,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.200]   like, has this changed your life or perspective?
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.560]   - Well, recently, so I started taking medication,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.260]   like going to therapy and the relationship that I have
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.680]   with being a mother is just so great now.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.320]   Like, I really look at him and I'm like,
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.000]   oh my God, I'm like so lucky to have you.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.840]   - Yeah.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.400]   - Like, just really, really enjoying it.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.640]   Actually, recently, 'cause he usually goes to school,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.920]   and like, I haven't even been wanting
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.360]   to send him to school lately,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.560]   'cause I'm like, I need to spend all the time with you.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.640]   - Is the dad, like, around for real?
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.960]   Or like, is it just you or how's that going?
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.080]   - Just me, he's only met his dad one time.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:32.120]   And after that, like, the dad wasn't super nice to me.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.600]   He wasn't nice about it, so I was just like,
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.040]   I'm not trying this with you anymore.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.000]   - Was he more mad about the fact that you had the kid?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.720]   Or like, did he not want you to have the kid?
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.320]   Or why would, I can't imagine,
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.080]   even if it was like a girl who I messed up with
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.440]   and I don't want nothing to do with her.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.600]   If I had a kid with that woman,
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.640]   I don't care how much I don't like her,
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.280]   I'm still trying to spend time with my kid.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.200]   - Also, like, it wasn't a one-time thing.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.440]   Like, he told me that he loved me.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.760]   Like, and then there's like other things
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.560]   that like, we had quit talking
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.760]   before I even found out that I was pregnant.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.160]   And like, he might've even had a girlfriend
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.380]   that I didn't know about, which might be like part of it.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.440]   And so it always was just like,
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.240]   I actually wrote like a poem about this on my Tumblr.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.800]   He never asked me to get an abortion or anything like that.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.920]   But constantly throughout my pregnancy,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.040]   I had never seen him since like the night
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   that we conceived our son.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.680]   I actually saw him last week
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.480]   for the first time in three years.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.780]   But he would call me during my pregnancy,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.040]   like every few months and be like,
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.120]   "Hey, like, I'm worried that you're gonna like,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.800]   people are gonna find out this or that.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.280]   Like, can you please like do this?"
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.880]   Like expecting me to protect him.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.000]   And I did for so long, just like out of love.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.320]   Like, everyone's like, "Oh, he paid her money
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.760]   or she has an NDA."
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.880]   Like, no, I don't.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.120]   Like, that's the father of my child.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.440]   Like, I'm not trying to do anything bad to him.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   Like, my son looks just like him.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.080]   So like, no matter what happens,
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.960]   I automatically will always have so much love for him
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.640]   because he's like part of my son.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.240]   - Right, I think that's honestly like,
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.600]   that's every dude who gets a girl pregnant's dream
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.480]   is you could just tell her like, "Yo, can you..."
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.200]   - You just take care of it yourself?
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.280]   - Well, no, not even that.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.160]   It's more the fact that you,
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.240]   I think it's crazy how you,
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.520]   I mean, a lot of dudes would pay the girl
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.760]   not to say who it was
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.000]   or just pay the girl to take care of the baby.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   But like, you just didn't even,
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.440]   you never have really come out and criticized the father
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.280]   or talked down about the father.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.400]   You've just, you know, been a mother.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.880]   - I mean, I've made some jokes online about it,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.360]   but he's gotten mad about.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.440]   No, nothing crazy.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.800]   Like, I've made like jokes, like in passing,
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.840]   like, "Don't have kids with NBA players."
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.200]   Or like, one time I was like shooting a hoop
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.960]   and I was like, "Well, I did have NBA DNA in me
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.440]   "for 10 months."
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.560]   - Yeah, you got a chip.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.400]   - I got a call after that.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.960]   I did not like those jokes.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.560]   - Really?
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.760]   Man, no, that's crazy.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.440]   My, one of my last questions for you is,
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.440]   like, you talk about how it's been a process
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.880]   to kind of find an identity,
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.720]   like outside of the industry and whatever.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.240]   And your real name's actually not Lana.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.640]   It's Amara, correct?
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.480]   - Amara.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.880]   - So if you kind of like, have you ever considered
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.360]   just going and leaving the Lana Rhodes, like behind
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.520]   and going by your real name and like,
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.160]   or is, I just wondered, like,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.560]   I thought your real name was Lana.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.400]   And then I was doing some.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.640]   - Yeah, sometimes I think my real name is Lana.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.480]   - Yeah, I was doing some research before this podcast
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.120]   and it was like Amara Maple.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:47.960]   And I was like, "Huh."
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.400]   - All my friends call me Lana.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.240]   - Really?
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.080]   - Yeah.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.040]   - So you just, that's just, that's just the name?
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.000]   - It might be like going back to like the BPD thing.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.640]   Like you really don't have like a sense of identity.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.080]   So I've never really resonated with like having a name.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.880]   Like even when I was a dancer, I had Farrah as my name.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.240]   And all my friends called me that,
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.600]   that I knew from the club.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.040]   Or Amara, which is what my family calls me.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.920]   I think like when I have boyfriends,
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.400]   like sometimes we like switch on and off
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.240]   from using Amara or Lana.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.280]   But I just, I really don't notice.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.240]   And sometimes I actually do think that my name is Lana.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.480]   - Huh, that's interesting.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   So what going forward for you, like, is your,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.720]   like going forward, where do you want to go from here?
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.800]   Like, is it just continue with the,
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.720]   with the OnlyFans stuff and influencer stuff?
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.760]   Or do you have other goals in your life going forward?
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.000]   Or kind of, where do you go from here?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.120]   - I just, I want to
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.560]   just keep having something that I'm like impassioned about.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.440]   And right now it's making clothes
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.600]   and just like even designing my own furniture for my house.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.360]   Or recently writing,
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.280]   which I never thought that I was good at
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.440]   'cause I dropped out of school in eighth grade.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.240]   But I wrote a few poems on Tumblr and people were like,
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.000]   "Oh my God, you're like such a good writer."
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.880]   And I never thought that I was.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.520]   So that's helped me a lot recently.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.520]   Just like always having a passion.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.000]   And then like, if you can find a way
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.680]   to turn that passion into income,
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.920]   like that's obviously amazing.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.640]   And, but the most important thing to me
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.760]   is just like being the best mom ever.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.320]   Like that comes first before anything.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.360]   - He looks like his baby daddy.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.960]   - Yeah.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.360]   - Have you ever thought about writing a book?
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.560]   Like, I feel like-
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.280]   - Everyone on Tumblr is telling me to.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.400]   They're like, "You're writing so good,
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.680]   you have to write a book."
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.600]   - No, that'd be cool.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.520]   I mean, I don't know if you'd write fiction or nonfiction,
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.920]   but I feel like your story,
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.120]   it is a good story like to get out there.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.640]   Just because I feel like it helps a lot of people.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.080]   When you can hear from a woman like you
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:37:59.920]   who was in the industry,
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.000]   but has so much to say about what it's really like,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.520]   it can kind of, you know,
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.680]   you can't really watch that stuff
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.880]   and look at these girls the same.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.560]   And I feel like a lot of men like objectify women,
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.720]   you know, it's just like a natural,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.280]   I don't know if it's definitely not natural,
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.120]   but it's like-
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:16.960]   - Part of like culture.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.080]   - It's part of the culture now.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.960]   And I feel like a lot of women even nowadays
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.640]   fall into that thinking like,
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.880]   "Oh, this is just how it is.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.280]   Like men objectify me, this is what I'm gonna do."
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.240]   - Or like they feel like they have to like
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.440]   have sex with men to get love or-
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.200]   - Or you live in LA and it's even like these girls,
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.320]   like I know these girls out here doing anything
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.200]   for acceptance or job opportunities or,
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.040]   and I just think-
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.280]   - Or even like a guy like flies around there,
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.600]   like, "Oh my God, he bought me a flight,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.080]   now I have to have sex with him."
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.360]   Like, what? No.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.080]   - You don't think if a dude fly you out,
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.400]   the girl gotta be giving it up?
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.480]   - Fuck no, no.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.600]   I've had a guy buy me a private jet to go somewhere
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.720]   and I didn't hook up with him.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.520]   - He wasn't hot?
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.360]   - No, it's not.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.600]   I have some of the most attractive men I've ever seen.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.440]   - No, I'm saying he wasn't mad.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.120]   Like he wasn't mad that you didn't use.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.480]   - I don't care.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.280]   I'm not doing something that I don't wanna do.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.120]   - No, for sure.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.400]   I'm just saying like-
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.160]   - Like they can be mad all that they want.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.560]   And if they show that they're mad,
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.240]   then I'm not gonna talk to them anymore, so.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.560]   - Yeah, that's definitely,
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.800]   I think dudes that are flying girls out,
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.280]   I think there's definitely an expectation.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.040]   I don't know if it's a good expectation.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.480]   I think if a dude is like,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.320]   "I'm spending any money on this girl,"
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.440]   like, yeah, like, she better be worth it.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.120]   - But that's not, the girl should not,
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.680]   like she should feel like she's worth more
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.120]   than whatever money he spent on it.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.160]   And also not feel obligated to give,
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.240]   like going back to like giving someone something
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.600]   that you don't have to give.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.640]   Like if you're not 100% sure
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.000]   that you wanna have sex with that person,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.720]   or give your body to that person,
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   or be intimate with them for like,
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.880]   'cause you really want it,
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.320]   and it's like for some other reason,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.400]   or you're unsure, like you shouldn't,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.880]   you definitely should not do it.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.920]   - And it's crazy you say that,
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.520]   'cause we had this conversation with some of my teammates
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.280]   the other day on the bus.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.680]   We were talking about like a girl who we would view
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.880]   as like a wifey, or like a girlfriend,
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.720]   like a girl you would cuff,
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.280]   versus a girl that you would just hook up with.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.000]   And we were like, "Okay, if she's giving it up
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.280]   "the first night, like how would you view her?"
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.800]   And we were all kinda like,
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.240]   "Well, we probably wouldn't wife that girl,
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.580]   "'cause if she's giving it up on the first night,
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.520]   "then she probably has done that multiple times."
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.160]   Then we were like, "Okay, then when is the right time
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.620]   "to give it up, second night, third night,
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.780]   "like for a date, whenever?"
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.100]   - And it really is, I think, for these girls out there
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.140]   that think that they should be giving it up
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.720]   when a dude is pressuring them,
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.640]   or he does something nice for 'em,
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.740]   but they really don't have that connection yet.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.580]   Like, dudes aren't gonna view you as a girlfriend,
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.140]   or like, they would never wanna cuff you
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.000]   if you're just giving it up right away.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.860]   So, your advice is really good.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.460]   - If you stand on your ground,
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.780]   and like you respect yourself in that way,
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.620]   like, I've honestly never had any problems
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.180]   with guys being mad about it.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.620]   And like, I did porn before,
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.540]   so people automatically assume
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.460]   that I'm going to sleep with people,
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.560]   or that I've slept with all the NBA players
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.060]   that I've hung out with.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.180]   I've never slept with any of them,
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.140]   besides the one that I have a kid with.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.760]   But none of these guys have gotten upset with me
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.320]   for not sleeping with them,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.380]   no matter what they had bought me,
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.860]   or like, we've gone on trips together.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.300]   - They tend to respect you.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.900]   - Yeah, like we end up having
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.860]   like a respectful, good friendship.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.100]   - I think, yeah, and I think that these girls nowadays
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.220]   definitely kind of think the opposite.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.160]   They get pressured, or they wanna make a dude happy.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.140]   Or like you said, that you kind of struggle
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.300]   with the people-pleasing thing.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.660]   They think that they gotta make this dude happy.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.060]   But if you really wanna,
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:00.980]   I don't know what these girls want.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.620]   Some girls just want to be able to say,
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.980]   oh, I hooked up with this guy, whatever.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.420]   But if you're a girl that really wants
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.660]   to be valued by a dude,
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.660]   and not just thought of as like a whatever,
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.380]   like an object, like we've been talking about,
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.340]   then it's not always bad to wait a while.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.260]   - Also, you mentioned having a connection.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.540]   So perhaps it's not necessarily like,
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.700]   oh, she slept with him too early.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.440]   But say she does sleep with him
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.860]   before they have that connection,
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.540]   and it's not someone that you actually have
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.140]   that chemistry or connection with,
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.060]   then it's not gonna work anyway.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.900]   You know?
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.180]   You can't force it from having sex with them early.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.100]   - Yeah, that might mess it up even worse.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.100]   But if you wait a while,
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.740]   now even the sex would probably be better,
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.780]   because you actually got to know them as a person.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.500]   - Or you could decide that you don't wanna sleep with them.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.780]   Usually I'll hang out with a guy four times,
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.260]   and on the fourth time, I know if there's someone
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.780]   that I'm going to be in love with and wanna have sex with.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.980]   If it doesn't happen with the fourth time,
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.060]   I'm like, okay, I don't like him like that.
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.700]   - How has the dating thing been for you
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:10.140]   since you've kinda left that industry?
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.340]   Is it difficult for you?
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.180]   Is it easy?
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.660]   How does that go?
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:18.660]   - Dating was easier after than when I was younger,
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.540]   because I had more respect for myself.
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.740]   My last relationship was really good,
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.620]   but I ended up getting pregnant two months after.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.040]   And then now I just really don't have time
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.620]   for a relationship.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.220]   I haven't hooked up with anyone since April,
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.940]   which is, I was super in love with that boy,
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.700]   but we're not dating or anything,
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:41.900]   because I don't have time.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.020]   I can't text a boy all day long.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:45.860]   I have to work.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.380]   I have to take care of my kid.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.940]   I'm not gonna go out and leave my child every night
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.060]   to go hang out with you.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.740]   So I just don't have time right now.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.300]   - Do dudes ever try to hold?
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.100]   'Cause I know dudes are petty.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.100]   Even me, I'm not acting like I'm--
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:00.940]   - He's an angel.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.140]   Oh, I know.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.220]   - How do you know?
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.420]   - I've heard your talks.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.460]   - No, I'm talking more like,
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:12.500]   do dudes try to hold things over your head from the past?
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.340]   'Cause I know me, I could be messing with a girl,
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.540]   and I hear something about something she did in the past
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.780]   or whatever, and it'll still make me mad.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.300]   I don't know if that's, that's probably not good,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.700]   but it'll still make me mad.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.780]   Do dudes try to hold things over your head?
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.600]   - I mean, that's probably something
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.980]   that you need to work on.
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:30.820]   - You know?
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.660]   - Yeah, no, it is.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.380]   I don't know why, I don't know why I do that.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.540]   - No, no, it happens.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.700]   How old are you?
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.540]   - 25.
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.940]   - Oh, see, you're still so young.
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.460]   Like, I used to be-- - How old are you?
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.100]   - I just turned 27.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.660]   But I used to be super jealous, too.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.300]   And honestly, it changes over time.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.340]   And you just, when you get older,
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.380]   you have a better understanding
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.540]   of relationships and connections.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.100]   And I personally, if I ever was to be in a relationship,
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.620]   I would never be, even though I don't wanna sleep
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.940]   with other people, I'd never be like,
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.740]   "Oh, you can't sleep with other people,"
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.380]   or, "You have to do this or do that."
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.460]   'Cause I personally think that it's way more powerful
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.060]   if you believe that you have this like,
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.500]   or you're with someone that you have
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.740]   a really special connection with,
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.940]   but you know they can't find somewhere else.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.980]   And it's more powerful if someone,
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.900]   like they have the options to do whatever they want,
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.380]   but they always choose you.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.220]   - 100%.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.660]   - You know, so that's kind of like what elite,
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.220]   having that mindset got rid of like that jealousy
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.300]   and insecurity that I used to have.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.340]   But guys have held it over my head.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.380]   And me and my ex, we got in a really like,
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.140]   crazy fight one night.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.700]   And actually I've had two boyfriends say this to me.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.460]   They would say, "No one's ever going to love you
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.540]   "because you did porn and you're a whore."
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.380]   - Seriously?
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.460]   - And yeah. - So then why would they,
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:49.700]   if that's really what they thought,
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.540]   they would still love you? - Well 'cause they try
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.540]   to tell you like, "Oh, I'm the only one
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.900]   "that's ever gonna love you, so you have to stay with me."
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.500]   - They're toxic, not me. - Yeah, yeah, no.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.060]   - That's crazy, yeah.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.500]   Nah, I definitely, as I've gotten older,
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.300]   I've realized when I was watching a podcast,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.500]   I think with, do you know a girl named Brittany Rayner?
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.340]   Do you know who that is?
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.500]   - Oh yeah, no, I love her.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.300]   - I was watching a podcast,
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.940]   I think she was on there with Andrew Tate.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:17.060]   I was watching the podcast and she was talking about,
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.020]   just, you know, she's done some things in the past,
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.340]   but she's not doing them anymore.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.740]   And like, are women like redeemable,
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:24.220]   like in the eyes of men,
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.620]   like if they've done things in the past
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.580]   and now they're a whole different person,
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.380]   like you, or I don't know if she's changed
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.380]   what she was doing, but like her.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.260]   And I think Andrew Tate said something like,
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.540]   "It just depends on the dude," or something.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.820]   I forget exactly what he said,
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.540]   but I think the right dude, you know,
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:47.620]   obviously in a mature man, for me,
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.820]   I've had to think about why do I get so mad
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.940]   about something that the girl might have did in the past
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.340]   or who she was messing with in the past,
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.980]   because, and I'm a dude who-
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.620]   - She had no idea she was gonna meet you in the future.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.660]   - And I've done wild stuff in the past too,
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.180]   so if a girl was gonna hold that over my head,
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.180]   then I would be in trouble
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.460]   because I've done some wild stuff.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.380]   And I've definitely been a dude back in the day
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.620]   who had like double standards,
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.060]   like, oh, I can have a crazy past,
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.260]   but she can't have any type of past,
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.700]   so I'm not messing with her.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.220]   But I think, like you said, as you get older
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.380]   and you see people like for who they are,
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.460]   and you kind of like meet them where they're at,
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.980]   like if you fall in love with this person
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.820]   and you like this person,
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.420]   you got to accept them for who they are
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.540]   and what they've done and-
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.180]   - Yeah, 'cause that's what made them
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.060]   the person that you love,
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.060]   all the experiences that they had.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.100]   - 100%, so I definitely think that's something
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.620]   that comes with maturity.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.500]   But now, I really appreciate you coming on.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.060]   I don't like to keep people on here that long.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.380]   I just, you know, people that I find either inspirational
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.100]   or people that I'm just curious about their stories
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.220]   or whatever, I like to have them on here
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.900]   and just ask a few questions that I'm curious about
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.060]   and then let 'em go.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.460]   So I appreciate you. - Curious Mike.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.380]   - I appreciate you helping on the podcast.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.660]   - Was it inspired by Curious George?
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.340]   - Sierra came up with it.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.900]   'Cause I've always just been a curious dude.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.580]   I'd always ask wild questions and just speak my mind.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:14.020]   And honestly, the podcast kind of came about
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.420]   because you know how people on the internet are.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.820]   And if you tweet something that's kind of like
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.540]   against the norm or you Instagram something,
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.740]   you get like crucified and people don't even know
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.820]   like what you were talking about.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.380]   They don't know context.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.100]   They'll take like a tweet or whatever and blow it up.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.500]   So I was like, what if I came out with a podcast
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.300]   and I could have like unfiltered conversations
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.260]   or conversations that people are kind of scared to have
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.900]   or whatever and just be like open.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.060]   'Cause I feel like, you know, that creates a space
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.420]   for understanding and more.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.260]   So that's kind of how I feel.
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.620]   - Yeah, you can hope so.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.220]   Some people never will though.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.380]   You can hope so that people understand
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:51.540]   that sometimes they never will.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.180]   - Right, nah, and you gotta accept that.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.700]   But nah, I appreciate you Lana.
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.540]   - Thank you.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:56.380]   - For sure.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.340]   Curious Mike out.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.420]   (laughing)
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.160]   (upbeat music)
