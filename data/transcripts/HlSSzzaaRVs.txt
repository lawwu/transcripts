[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.240]   - Welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.280]   I am here with Lana Rhodes.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.520]   Yeah, so people are gonna be surprised
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.880]   that we're on a podcast together,
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880]   but I actually came across one of your podcasts
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880]   that you used to do,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.720]   'cause I was messing with one of your friends,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.960]   and she sent me the podcast,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840]   and you were talking about just the dark sides
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.360]   of the adult film industry and the porn industry,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.160]   which you used to be a part of,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.840]   and it really just, I was really interested,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.760]   and honestly, inspired by your story.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.560]   So that's kinda why I wanna have you on,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.560]   and I appreciate you being vulnerable
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.200]   and coming on the podcast.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.680]   - No, thank you, that's so sweet.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.640]   - Yeah, not for sure.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.460]   So let's start off just with your childhood.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.260]   I feel like a lot of people who end up
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.440]   in the sex industry at all
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.600]   kinda have an unorthodox kinda upbringing.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.320]   Was yours a usual upbringing,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.720]   or how'd that go growing up?
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.080]   - So there's a lot of things
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.360]   that I've come to terms with recently
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.920]   that I didn't even realize were wrong in my childhood.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.240]   Like the past year, I've started going to therapy,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.900]   and I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder,
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.160]   and I've been through so many things
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.120]   that I was like, oh, maybe this caused it,
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.720]   or this caused it.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.400]   And the one thing that really,
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.840]   I feel like if you don't have borderline BPD,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.560]   you won't understand the feeling.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.960]   But basically to figure it out,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.640]   I had to go back and think,
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.800]   when was the first time that I had this feeling
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.620]   that no one loves me,
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.860]   and just overwhelming emotions
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.520]   to the point where it feels like
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.020]   you have to hurt yourself in some way.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.020]   And so that came from just like when you're a young child
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.940]   and you're developing your attachment to parents
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.460]   or emotional regulation skills,
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.880]   if people invalidate you,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.220]   like say you're crying and your parents yell at you
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.420]   to make you stop or they hit you,
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.760]   and I'm talking like two, three years old,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.720]   obviously you should never hit your kids.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.520]   It can cause that.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.240]   And I just had no idea.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.280]   I actually thought that everyone's parents hit them.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.600]   And I really thought that,
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.720]   I thought maybe it just started young doing it.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.280]   And I asked a couple of my friends,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.680]   I was like, how old were you
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.800]   when your parents hit you for the first time?
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.640]   And they were like, what?
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.960]   My parents never hit me.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.840]   So there's just a lot.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.360]   And then I have a sister who has schizophrenia too.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   So I feel like I wasn't dealt like the best hand of cards
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.040]   when it comes to like family circumstances,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.440]   which definitely contributed to the decisions
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.040]   that I made when I was older,
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.480]   because if your brain is just like completely like warped
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.200]   from going through so much,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.600]   like going through certain things
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.080]   can actually change your brain chemistry
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.160]   and damage it.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.120]   And so I don't think that I would have made the decisions
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.120]   that I made if I was in a better state of mind,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.800]   because I only was in the industry
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   for a short period of time.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.320]   And that was because I finally was able to like get away
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.920]   from where I was living and like be separated
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.560]   and live my own life and experience the world
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.160]   and kind of like heal.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.400]   'Cause I wasn't in that constant.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.340]   - Right, was there, did you have your father around or no?
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.900]   - No, so my parents got divorced
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.220]   when my mom was pregnant with me.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.700]   - Gotcha. - Yeah.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.620]   - So yeah, obviously like growing up was tough.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.420]   I had a woman on the podcast
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.820]   who also she kind of ended up in the industry.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.380]   She actually was trafficked and she had a similar childhood.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.100]   I don't think she had a father figure around
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.420]   and her upbringing wasn't the best
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.020]   and it led her to hanging around some people
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.780]   and idolizing certain things.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.260]   And she ended up, you know, in a really messed up situation.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.420]   So, you know, you go through that childhood
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.300]   and then I think your teenage years
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.740]   is when you kind of started getting into the industry.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.140]   How did that kind of unfold?
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.700]   Like, what was the steps that you took
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.400]   to even, you know, get into that?
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.860]   - Well, yeah, it was kind of like a progressive
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.420]   like ladder effect.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.020]   I started out working at like a restaurant
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.660]   similar to Hooters when I was 17.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.820]   And it's not that I don't like know my dad at all.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.580]   I just don't spend a lot of time with him.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.500]   But he like signed the paper so that I could work there
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.700]   because it's like a restaurant
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.100]   where you have to wear like a sexy outfit
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.400]   and I wasn't even 18.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.320]   So that was like my first like kind of job
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.980]   where men sexualize you and look at you in that way.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.860]   And I never thought that I was like pretty
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.060]   or anything growing up.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.020]   So it was, I was like, wow, they hired me here.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.460]   Like I'm pretty enough to work here.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.940]   And then like guys coming up to me and giving me $20
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.860]   and being like, you're so hot, here's $20.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.300]   It was just like, it was so weird to me
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.540]   but also validating
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.020]   'cause I didn't have that self-esteem.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.980]   So I kind of went further down the rabbit hole.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.820]   When I turned 18, I left that job
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.940]   and I went straight to becoming a dancer at a club.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.860]   And then after that, it was porn.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.700]   - Right.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.420]   And I don't wanna spend too much time
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.960]   kind of in that period of your life
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.460]   which is a very brief period.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.500]   I think a total, you said you filmed around eight months?
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.120]   - Yeah, like two, four months stints.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.200]   - Got you.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.660]   What I really kind of wanna get at is the fact that,
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.460]   in terms of being a porn star,
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.460]   like you had everything that any girl
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.660]   in that industry would want.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.940]   You got the fame, you got the popularity,
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.380]   probably were making more money than most girls.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.820]   And you kind of threw that all away
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.140]   and now are kind of an advocate against a lot of this stuff
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.840]   and you speak openly and you're very passionate
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.220]   about kind of what goes on
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.500]   in the dark sides of the porn industry
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.520]   and how it's not, everything kind of isn't as it seems.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.740]   So what kind of brought about your change in perspective?
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.700]   - I am just, I actually had an experience last,
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.940]   so I started doing OnlyFans again
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.660]   and I had an experience last night
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.980]   with another girl that reminded me
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.420]   of how I felt in those times.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.460]   So it's like, I actually couldn't sleep last night
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.220]   'cause I was just so hurt by this happening.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.900]   Me and one of my good girlfriends,
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.460]   we went live on OnlyFans last night
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.340]   and I just recognized this facial expression that she had
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.860]   that she looked so uncomfortable.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.940]   And this was our third time doing it.
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.560]   We're friends, we kiss off camera and stuff.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.940]   So I wasn't expecting it, but I was like, are you okay?
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.780]   Are you comfortable?
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.120]   And she's like, oh, I just have anxiety.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.500]   And then she went off to the side and started just bawling
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.940]   and I turned the live off and it's just such,
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   I feel honestly destroyed that I even had any part
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.620]   in someone feeling not comfortable
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.060]   with what they were doing.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.860]   And also she was explaining to me
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.880]   that she needs to make money for certain things
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.360]   so she feels like she doesn't say no
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.560]   to all the things that she would want to.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.900]   And it's probably good that this experience happened with me
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.900]   because I have been through that so much myself
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.300]   that I was able to give her really good advice,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.620]   even though it's something
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.320]   that literally killed me inside to be part of.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.180]   But that's essentially what it was.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.620]   It's a bunch of really young girls
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.860]   who get into the industry.
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.140]   Like the younger, the better for them.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.420]   These girls, like when I started, I looked like a little kid
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.500]   like I looked like a little kid.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.580]   And that's what they like, that's what sells.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.200]   And a lot of girls, even my friends,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.680]   we don't feel comfortable saying no for some reason.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.260]   'Cause we just, I don't know,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.180]   it's just like a natural girl thing.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.180]   I think we're taught as children to like be obedient,
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.620]   especially to like men
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.820]   or like if you're raised in a religious family,
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.220]   like it's always like obey your father, stuff like that.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.980]   And so it's a really big problem
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.940]   with girls feeling pressured by like agents
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.900]   who don't necessarily have their best interest in mind.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.420]   And I'm doing a lot of things that really hurt them.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.260]   Like for me, there are certain scenes that I did
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.280]   that I felt like I didn't say anything to them
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.020]   because it's work and I wanted to be professional.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.580]   But for example, when the camera would be behind me
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.460]   and you couldn't see my face,
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.620]   I would be gagging or crying
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.860]   because I felt like I was being raped
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.000]   because I did not want to be doing it.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.460]   And I didn't wanna be feeling the things in my body
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.780]   that I was feeling.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.280]   'Cause I was honestly like disgusted
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.500]   by the person that I was having to shoot with
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.380]   'cause you don't get to choose.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.020]   So it's just stuff like that that can be very damaging.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.560]   And it's not the other people's fault.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.220]   - It's just a huge problem that there's not really anything
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.820]   to set up to protect girls that are young and vulnerable
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.540]   that don't know how to say no
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.260]   or don't like have self-respect for themselves yet
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.180]   or care for themselves or love themselves
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.640]   because they've been through so much and like taught not to.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.340]   - And I feel like a lot of people,
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.180]   I don't know if you guys received the backlash,
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.220]   like, oh, you guys chose to do this or whatever.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.740]   But when you're in your teenage years
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.060]   and then you're around these older men,
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.100]   I'm sure they're all older.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.460]   - Yeah, they're all in their 40s.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.620]   They know exactly how to get you to do what you want,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.560]   what they want, to make them money.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.460]   - And then you guys don't even really make much, I'm sure.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.820]   - No, it's pickles.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.900]   Like, I was the number one porn star
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.900]   and my rate was $1,200 for a sex scene, $1,200.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.740]   - That's unbelievable.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.820]   - But obviously like a lot of these girls are coming from
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.900]   small towns, like their families probably don't have money.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.100]   I thought $100 at the time was like so much money.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.620]   So getting 1,200 was like a big deal.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.620]   But then I met this boy who worked in,
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.260]   not the guy that I ended up dating for a long time,
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.620]   but I met this other boy that worked
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.660]   in like YouTube and Instagram.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.400]   And he shared with me that he was getting $15,000
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.100]   to pose with a Jeep on Instagram.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.380]   And I was like, I'm getting $1,200 for a sex scene.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.820]   This is not okay.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.540]   - Yeah, and I think that's one thing like this industry,
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.860]   like it continues to take off, you know, as time goes on,
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.420]   you know, more people are exposed to it at a younger age.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.620]   It's like, like porn is a real life addiction
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.560]   for a lot of people.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.060]   But a lot of these young men that are introduced to it,
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.760]   they don't really know kind of behind the scenes
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.700]   what you guys deal with.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.900]   They look at these girls on camera and think like,
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.540]   oh, they're enjoying it, this is what they like,
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.820]   this is, you know, whatever.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.100]   And I think that it's important for people like you,
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.020]   especially super successful people like you
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.660]   that decided to leave, like to kind of educate young men.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.700]   And I guess young women now,
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.260]   I saw a lot of young women watch porn too,
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.220]   but just that it's not, that's not what it is.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.780]   It's not, it's glamorous and it's not like these,
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.740]   it's not what it appears to be kind of.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.740]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.540]   It was like, you could probably could not tell at all
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.460]   that I felt the way that I did in the certain scenes
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.340]   because it's a job, it's acting.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.860]   And like, I had like pre-planned things
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.500]   that I was going to say during the scenes,
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.100]   like facial expressions that I was gonna make,
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.740]   things that I was gonna do because it's fake, it's fake.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.140]   And I also think like the point that you made
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.380]   that the guys don't understand
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.020]   what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.300]   And then also that people are like,
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.740]   oh, you knew what you got into.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.380]   And like, you get backlash for talking out about it.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.940]   I think it's because men like consuming porn
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.420]   and they don't wanna feel guilty for consuming it.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.620]   And so they don't wanna hear
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.580]   that I felt the way that I felt.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.340]   And they refuse to believe that I'm not like a giant whore
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.620]   that wants to get like fucked by like a bunch of big dicks.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.660]   Like, I'm the biggest prude in real life.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.100]   - How did you, did you,
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.700]   because I know a lot of women that are in that industry,
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.100]   it's very hard to get out
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.980]   or like you almost feel like you're stuck.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.820]   And even the girls that do,
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.380]   sometimes the only way out to them may seem like suicide.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.380]   Like I saw a stat on your podcast
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.020]   where it was like the average life expectancy
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.900]   of someone in the sex industry for a woman is about 37.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.180]   And the average life expectancy
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.660]   outside of that industry is 78, I think.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.180]   And I was just like, how is that possible?
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.940]   So a lot of, obviously a lot of these girls
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.620]   feel like there's no way out.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.020]   How were you able to kind of get out
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.700]   and kind of just like, I guess,
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.580]   find your identity outside of the industry?
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.860]   - I mean, I had to,
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.740]   or it probably would have led to that point
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.980]   of like killing myself.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.980]   And 'cause I started like towards the end of it,
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.700]   I started having panic attacks,
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.180]   like before scenes 'cause I really didn't wanna do them.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.060]   And I didn't know how to say, no, I don't wanna do this.
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.660]   So there really was no choice for me.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.620]   It was either like probably going to kill myself
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.620]   or just do anything to like make something else work.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.060]   And this is what I was telling my friend last night,
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.180]   'cause she was saying that she's not really happy
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.020]   with doing OnlyFans anymore.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.980]   And I'm like, she has other passions
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.860]   that she's interested in.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.700]   I really believe anyone,
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.540]   if they just work towards anything that they wanna do,
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.580]   just a little bit every single day, like you can get there.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.220]   Just 'cause a lot of people aren't willing
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.340]   to like work every single day and put in the effort.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.740]   But if you do, it really does pay off.
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.620]   When I quit porn,
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.860]   I only had like 200,000 followers on Instagram.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.220]   And I met this boy and I was like,
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.700]   okay, I wanna do what he does.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.820]   I wanna be an Instagram influencer.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.660]   And I grew my account to over 10 million in one year,
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.180]   just by literally asking all my friends,
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.180]   hey, can you take a picture of me today?
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.020]   Hey, can you help me with this?
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.460]   And just always posting, like working on my Instagram.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.380]   And then I started getting brand deals which sustained me
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.700]   so that I didn't have to do any sex work.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.140]   And then it just progressed over time
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.940]   with the stuff that I do.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.060]   Like I ended up doing YouTube with my boyfriend,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.580]   and then a podcast, and now I'm doing fashion.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.300]   So I really think like it doesn't really make sense
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.220]   where I came from in porn to where I am now.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.140]   And I think it's really just believing that you can
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.580]   and putting in effort every single day to get there.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.420]   - Yeah, I mean, I find that kind of inspiring
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.820]   because I know a lot of people,
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.740]   you hear the term selling yourself for fame or money
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.180]   or whatever, but like the fact that you were
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.940]   the number one porn star,
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.180]   and then you chose to kind of like let all that go.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.620]   Like I know I've talked to some rappers who do the music,
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.940]   and they talk about how they don't really want
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.100]   to be making the type of music they do.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.420]   They don't wanna talk about the violence or the whatever.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.580]   They would rather be a positive message.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.340]   But the reason that they talk about these things
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.340]   is because it sells.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.860]   And they're making a lot of money,
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.300]   and they know if they change their message or whatever,
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.060]   they wouldn't be as successful.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.700]   And it's similar in your story because you were doing
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.180]   all that, but you decided to step down from that
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.420]   and try to find ways to make money
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.820]   or find your identity outside of porn.
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.740]   I feel like that obviously takes a big like leap of faith.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.540]   And it's just very hard to do when you kind of have become
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.700]   something, but you wanna completely shift away from it.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.300]   So I admire you for that.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.200]   And that's kind of why I wanted to talk to you about this.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.060]   But yeah, I think one thing that my sister mentioned
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.200]   was as this porn industry kind of increases,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.620]   you also see like an increase in just the human trafficking,
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.820]   the sex trafficking as well, which I find that to be like,
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.700]   I mean, it's probably pretty obvious why they grow together,
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.220]   but have you seen that?
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.140]   Can you speak on that?
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.540]   Or why do you think the rise in porn also equals the rise
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.140]   in the human trafficking?
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.720]   How do those kind of collide together?
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.120]   - I personally haven't like experienced human trafficking.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.180]   Or the closest like that I've ever been to meeting someone
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.540]   who has was I went to Juvie when I was a teen
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.780]   and really like, it's really sad.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.820]   There were some of the most beautiful, amazing girls
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.500]   that I met in there and they were like 12 years old
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.660]   and like their parents had been like pimping them out
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.240]   since they were like 11.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.620]   And like this one girl looked like a model.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.360]   She was so beautiful and like this was happening to her
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.060]   because her parents did dope.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.740]   And so they were pimping out their 11 year old daughter.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.260]   And I remember at one point she like,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.740]   like there was like something on her butt or something
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.460]   and like she wanted me to look at it.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.900]   And like, she bent over and she didn't have like underwear on
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.620]   and like, because if girls like get raped very young
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.900]   or like have to have sex, it can like ruin their vagina.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.100]   And it was just, I felt so bad for her
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.100]   'cause she was only 12 and it looked like just,
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.360]   I don't know, it's hard.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.420]   But that's the closest experience that I've had with that.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.660]   I'm not like too educated on what's going on with.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.140]   - Gotcha. - Yeah.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.780]   - Gotcha, now I was just curious about that.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.620]   So what advice would you then give to,
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.020]   so I guess a lot of girls are then going into this industry
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.400]   obviously by free will.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.340]   So what advice, being where you are now
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.500]   and seeing what you've seen,
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.180]   what advice would you then give girls
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.340]   who are considering going into the industry?
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.700]   - And there's a few things.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.500]   One, my experience and other girls' experiences
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.220]   may be different.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.820]   Like I know people, girls who supposedly
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.660]   really like doing it.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.060]   And like, that's fine for them to like doing it.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.300]   The difference between me and those girls that I've noticed
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.220]   is that before I did porn, I was only with one guy.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.220]   Like I didn't hook up with people.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.580]   I still like have to be in love with someone
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.580]   to want to like be physical with them.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.380]   And the other girls before they did porn,
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.620]   the ones who like tend to like it more,
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:58.660]   it's because they're already doing like gang bangs
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.820]   in their personal life
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.500]   or like being very sexually active already.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.540]   And so it like makes more sense to them.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.820]   - They were like already fucked.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.700]   - Yeah, they were already doing it.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.700]   And so they're like, why not make money off of it?
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.300]   And it's something that they enjoy supposedly.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:21.300]   I mean, I'm sure like some of them have had like days
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.620]   on set that didn't go well.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.820]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.460]   Do you feel like, so then what do you think contributes
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.340]   to the girls who end up in that industry
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.380]   doing so many drugs or the suicide rates?
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.460]   Why do you feel like that is so high then?
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.340]   Do you just feel like there's a lot of girls
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.980]   that do feel like you?
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.860]   Or do you just feel like, yeah, what do you think happens?
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.980]   - I'm kind of going back to like what happened
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.340]   with my friend last night.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:55.580]   She didn't wanna be doing it,
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.260]   but she felt like she needed money.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.980]   And so like the piece of advice that I gave her was just,
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.020]   if there's a piece of yourself
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.020]   that you don't feel like you can give,
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.460]   don't give it for anything
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.860]   because that's gonna end up like fucking you up
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.580]   so bad in the long run.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.140]   And like, I know because I gave way too much of myself
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.740]   that I didn't want to.
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.740]   And like no money is worth doing that really.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.740]   And I imagine like the girls wanting to kill themselves
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.460]   or like taking drugs, like even just to deal with it,
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.260]   like to do the scenes maybe
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.500]   if they don't wanna be doing it
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.620]   so they can like disassociate
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.420]   'cause they just need to like make money
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.180]   to sustain themselves at that point.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.660]   Also like if your body,
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.820]   it's just not natural for people I think
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.300]   to be having sex with people that they don't know
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.380]   and that they're not attracted to.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.220]   And also like, even if you do like doing sex work,
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.460]   there might be a day where you don't like having sex
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.300]   or you don't wanna be sexual
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.260]   and you still have to do it anyway.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:08.260]   So it's a bit traumatizing to share your body in that way
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.500]   'cause it's such an intimate thing.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.340]   - Right.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.580]   - And it's just not natural to be doing--
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.940]   - No, 100% agree.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.540]   - That stuff's like, imagine like you just meet someone
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.060]   in the lobby and like you're not attracted to them at all
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.860]   and it's like, okay, now you have to fuck them
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.060]   and pretend that you like it.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:25.900]   - Right.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.900]   No, that's definitely--
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.340]   - It's awful.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.180]   - It's crazy.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.860]   No, this is definitely crazy to think about.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.780]   That's definitely, I mean,
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.060]   I think it's something obviously more intimate.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.620]   But I think, I'm sure guys in the industry,
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.060]   they probably don't process stuff
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.180]   the way females do,
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.380]   like they're in there living their best life probably.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.900]   - That's, so some of them,
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.900]   so like maybe when they first got into it,
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.340]   but a lot of them do have problems too.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.540]   Like there's like these injections
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.380]   that guys have to do before the scenes.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.340]   Like they can't even get hard anymore.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.020]   - Right, yeah, I didn't hear about that.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.780]   - Yeah, so they have to like shoot up their dick
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.700]   with some sort of stimulant, I don't know what it is.
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.220]   Or I did date one guy when I was in the porn industry
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.540]   who was like a director and he performed in his own scenes.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.900]   And they get,
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.380]   which I've seen this with like celebrity men too
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.780]   that have hooked up with a lot of girls.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.700]   They get so like numb to just regular sex
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.820]   or just women that they end up
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.620]   having like these like really intense fetishes
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.020]   'cause they can't like get off to normal things anymore.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.620]   Like I've met guys who like being peed on,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.340]   who buy cookies with poop in them off the internet
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.300]   and watch those pooping.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.820]   - Honestly, I know what you're talking about
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.660]   because even in the NBA, like you talk about,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.900]   and this is why I think like porn is dangerous,
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.580]   but also hooking up with too many people
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.700]   and because you get desensitized to the normal thing.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.780]   And this happens in the NBA.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.580]   Like I hear wild stories about some of these dudes,
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.420]   but like you said.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.340]   - Oh, trust me.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.100]   (both laughing)
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.300]   Other celebrities too that their fetishes get so crazy.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.780]   They might be a straight man,
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.820]   but they've done so much stuff with so many pretty girls
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.340]   and they have so much access to pretty girls
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.380]   that now they're over here messing with trannies
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.740]   or now they're over here messing with dudes.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.940]   And it's like, it's crazy to think about.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.340]   And I think, obviously,
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.340]   I think the porn industry has a part to play in that
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.780]   because you watch a,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.620]   when you first get introduced to it,
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.220]   just seeing a girl naked might be enough for you,
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.380]   but then you keep watching it
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.820]   and now you're looking at the craziest things
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.700]   and now normal sex in real life doesn't do it for you.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.540]   - Definitely.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.140]   And also, how old were you the first time that you saw porn?
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.660]   - Man, my mom caught me too.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.700]   (both laughing)
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.400]   But I really didn't want, I just looked up,
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.240]   like I think I probably was in like, I don't know,
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.260]   maybe when I was like 11 or 12, maybe 13.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.020]   - So young to where you haven't--
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.940]   - And I just looked up naked girls or something like that.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.700]   - Yeah, like you Google boobs or something.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.060]   (both laughing)
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.260]   - All I saw was a naked girl, I was like,
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.620]   but then like, yeah, so I understand.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.260]   - But imagine being young
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.460]   and having no sexual experience yourself
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.500]   and then you watch a porn scene for the first time
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.060]   and then you think that's what sex is,
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.020]   like this wild performance.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.340]   Like I think one of the first sex scenes I saw
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.540]   was Sasha Gray.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.920]   And like, she was like wild, like licking toilet seats,
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.980]   doing like double anal gang bangs.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.860]   And so this is what I saw.
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.860]   And like, I thought when I first hooked up with my husband,
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.300]   which is the only person I slept with before porn,
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.460]   I thought that like how you suck a dick
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.220]   was like what I saw on camera,
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.120]   which is like, oh, you have to like deep throat it.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.860]   Like everything that I thought about sex was what I watched,
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.460]   which now I've learned like,
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.860]   that's not even what I like at all.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.100]   - Hold on, so you was married before you went into porn?
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.940]   - Yeah.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.860]   - So you married at like what, like 17?
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.940]   - At 18.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.780]   - Oh, wow.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.060]   - I met him a week before I turned 18.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.500]   - Got you, that's crazy.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.980]   But now I feel you, it messes up
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.300]   kind of your perception of what it's supposed to be.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.280]   And even I think these dudes nowadays,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.220]   I mean, obviously some girls are into some crazy things,
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.720]   but these dudes that are always watching porn,
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.940]   they think that this is always what a girl wants
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.780]   and now they're going to these girls
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.980]   and not knowing really what they actually enjoy.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.220]   And like I said, some of these girls are out here
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.100]   and they're freaks, so they like all this stuff,
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.460]   but not all of them, you know what I mean?
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.260]   So I think it's really detrimental to young men.
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.580]   And then if they go and they got a girl
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.180]   and the girl doesn't wanna do this,
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.820]   now they can't even really get off to him.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.540]   Like I know some dudes that would rather watch porn
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.640]   than hook up with their girlfriend
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.420]   because their girlfriend may not do all the things
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.980]   that they're seeing on the screen.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.580]   I feel like that is-- - That's actually wild.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.100]   - That is super unhealthy.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.220]   - Yeah, no, that's, also I didn't know
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.220]   how I would feel about that as a girlfriend.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.900]   - Yeah, do you think that's considered,
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:05.940]   'cause I know a lot of dudes, you know,
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.560]   they might have a wife that's ready in the bedroom,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.160]   but she's not doing the things that you see on camera,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.140]   so they're going to sneak in the bathroom and watching porn.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.240]   As a woman, do you feel like that would be considered
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.420]   cheating if you were married to a dude?
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:24.420]   - I personally feel it might also be a BPD thing,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.540]   'cause you're very sensitive to rejection,
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.820]   but I do get very upset if I have a partner
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.800]   and for whatever reason, they don't wanna,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   they reject me for sex, it makes me spiral.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:44.060]   So I can only imagine if your significant other
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.000]   doesn't wanna fuck you and they're more interested
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.580]   in seeing something else, yeah, I would be extremely hurt.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.700]   - Yeah, and I feel like that happens so much now.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.940]   Like, rejected and feeling probably
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.820]   just like shit about yourself.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.520]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.380]   But outside, so like now you obviously
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.600]   have kind of turned your life around
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.800]   and you're not doing that anymore.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.820]   Did it take you a while?
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.540]   I know you talk about how it's super frustrating for you
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.620]   anywhere you walk, anywhere you go.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.380]   People look at you and they see a porn star
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.880]   and you've been out of that for so many years now.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.660]   How do you deal with that?
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.540]   And did it take you a while to not be triggered by that?
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.740]   I know it's probably super frustrating.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.860]   You're doing your thing outside of that industry now,
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.180]   but how has that gone for you?
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.780]   - I used to care a lot more than I do.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.780]   Like when I started my podcast with Olivia and Alexa,
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:51.700]   I kind of did it in a way to like make myself,
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.700]   like I wanted to use it in a way to like show people
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.800]   how I actually was or like really like focused
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.060]   on like speaking well to sort of beat the stereotype
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.980]   of like being a dumb porn star.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.660]   Like I used to really, really care what people think
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.760]   and like trying to prove that I wasn't the stereotype.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.320]   And then after, when I got pregnant,
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.520]   like the bullying online got so bad with it
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.960]   that I just became like tuned out to it
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.680]   and I don't give a fuck anymore.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.920]   Like I don't give a shit.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.760]   - I mean, a lot of athletes have to go through that too.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.600]   So I feel you.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.480]   - You guys get hella bullied, so bad, like the worst.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.320]   - People talk crazy to us.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.680]   And so I know how that feels.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.440]   And you really eventually reach a point where it's like,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.120]   man, I don't care what these people are talking about.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.120]   - No, you can't.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.520]   - They have no relevance in my life.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.960]   Why are they so concerned what I'm doing?
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.440]   - And also once you start to like truly know who you are
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.680]   and like your morals and values,
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.520]   how can they tell you who you are if you know?
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.000]   - How has the, you know, being a mother now,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.840]   and we talked about this before the podcast,
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.160]   everybody says there's speculations who the baby daddy is.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.240]   And you know, like I--
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.080]   - Yeah, people are gonna say you're the baby daddy now.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.760]   They're gonna like put side by side pictures.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.820]   - I know, but like when we were in the playoffs,
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.320]   obviously like my teammate, Bruce,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.040]   who that's who I met you through,
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.560]   we all were kicking it somewhere out here in LA.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.040]   But, you know, like during the playoffs we would clap,
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.840]   we would just like, bro, your picture, is this your baby?
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.040]   But obviously you probably, I mean,
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.960]   you're keeping that like on the low for a reason.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.940]   But how has being a mother kind of changed your life
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.000]   and changed your perspective?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.760]   Do you feel like, has it helped you?
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.380]   - It's kind of like you win some and you lose some,
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.060]   you know, my pregnancy caused a lot of like health issues
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.500]   that I finally like have gotten under control
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.100]   and like sort of those also diminished my mental health.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.180]   Like probably for the past two years until recently,
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.500]   I was in like the worst mental health state
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.700]   that I'd ever been in.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.620]   However, because I grew up in a house
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.900]   with a sister who was extremely mentally ill
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.100]   and it was like very toxic for me.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.380]   No matter what, I always make sure
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.540]   to never let my son see that.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.500]   And to always make sure that whether I'm depressed
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.740]   and stuck in bed, that he has the best nanny
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.540]   taking him to go and do activities
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.220]   if I can't do that with him.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.900]   Or taking him out to dinner.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.100]   Because I, like I don't want the things
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.100]   that I go through to affect him.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.980]   And I really don't think that they do
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.120]   'cause I'm super careful about it.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.940]   But, sorry, what was the original question?
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.500]   - No, I was just curious how just being a mother
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.380]   like has just changed your life or perspective?
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.580]   - Well, recently, so I started taking medication,
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.620]   like going to therapy and the relationship
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.700]   that I have with being a mother is just so great now.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.240]   Like I really look at him and I'm like,
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.300]   "Oh my God, I'm like so lucky to have you."
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.420]   Like just really, really enjoying it.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.660]   Actually recently, 'cause he usually goes to school
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.300]   and like I haven't even been wanting to send him
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.800]   to school lately 'cause I'm like,
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.540]   "I need to spend all the time with you."
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.660]   - Is the dad like around for real?
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.940]   Or like, is it just you or how's that going?
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.160]   - Just me.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.060]   He's only met his dad one time.
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:32.120]   And after that, like the dad wasn't super nice about it.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:37.420]   So I was just like, "I'm not trying this with you anymore."
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.580]   - Was he more mad about the fact
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.980]   that you like had the kid
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.540]   or did he not want you to have the kid or why would...
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.740]   I can't imagine, even if it was like a girl
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.940]   who I messed up with and I don't want nothing
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.420]   to do with her.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.600]   If I had a kid with that woman,
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.620]   I don't care how much I don't like her,
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.260]   I'm still trying to spend time with my kid.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.180]   - Also like it wasn't a one-time thing.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.460]   Like he told me that he loved me.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.740]   Like, and then there's like other things
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.460]   that like we had quit talking before I've even found
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.660]   out that I was pregnant.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.140]   And like, he might've even had a girlfriend
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.380]   that I didn't know about, which might be like part of it.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.420]   And so it always was just like,
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.220]   I actually wrote like a poem about this on my Tumblr.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:30.780]   He never asked me to get an abortion or anything like that.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.900]   But constantly throughout my pregnancy,
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.020]   I had never seen him since like the night
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.980]   that we conceived our son.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.300]   I actually saw him last week for the first time
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.500]   in three years.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.780]   But he would call me during my pregnancy,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.020]   like every few months and be like,
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.140]   "Hey, like I'm worried that you're gonna like,
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.820]   people are gonna find out this or that.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.300]   Like, can you please like do this?"
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.900]   Like expecting me to protect him.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.020]   And I did for so long, just like out of love.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.340]   Like everyone's like, "Oh, he paid her money
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.740]   or she has an NDA."
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.860]   Like, no, I don't.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.140]   Like that's the father of my child.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.420]   Like, I'm not trying to do anything bad to him.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.460]   Like my son looks just like him.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.100]   So like, no matter what happens,
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.940]   I automatically will always have so much love for him
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.660]   because he's like part of my son.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:16.500]   - Right.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.220]   I think that's honestly like,
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.580]   that's every dude who gets a girl pregnant's dream
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.460]   is you could just tell her like, "Yo, can you?"
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.220]   - You just take care of it yourself.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.300]   - Well, no, not even that.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.220]   It's more the fact that you,
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.300]   I think it's crazy how you,
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.580]   I mean, a lot of dudes would pay the girl
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.780]   not to say who it was
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.980]   or just pay the girl to take care of the baby.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.060]   But like, you just didn't even,
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.460]   you never have really come out and criticized the father
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.300]   or talked down about the father.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.420]   You've just, you know, been a mother.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.860]   - I mean, I've made some jokes online about it.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.700]   - You've talked to him?
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.380]   - Like he's gotten mad about.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.460]   No, nothing crazy.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.820]   Like I've made like jokes, like in passing,
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.820]   like don't have kids with NBA players.
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:59.140]   Or like, one time I was like--
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.220]   - I think we're good fathers.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.940]   - Shooting a hoop and I was like,
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.380]   well, I did have NBA DNA in me for 10 months.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.540]   - Yeah, you got a chip.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.860]   - I got a call after that, I did not like those jokes.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.540]   - You really?
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.260]   Man, now that's crazy.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.420]   One of my last questions for you is,
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.420]   Mike, you talk about how it's been a process
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.820]   to kind of find an identity
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.700]   like outside of the industry and whatever.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.220]   And your real name is actually not Lana,
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.660]   it's Amara, correct?
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.500]   - Yeah, Amara.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.420]   - So if you kind of like,
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.820]   have you ever considered just going
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.340]   and leaving the Lana Rhodes like behind
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.540]   and going by your real name?
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.940]   And like, or is, I just wondered,
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.540]   like I thought your real name was Lana.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.380]   And then I was doing some--
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.620]   - Yeah, sometimes I think my real name is Lana.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.460]   - Yeah, I was doing some research before this podcast
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.140]   and it was like Amara Maple.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:47.980]   And I was like, huh, like--
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.380]   - All my friends call me Lana.
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.220]   - Really?
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.060]   - Yeah.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.020]   - So you just, that's just, that's just it now?
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.980]   - It might be like, going back to like the BPD thing,
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.620]   like you really don't have like a sense of identity.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.100]   So I've never really resonated with like having a name.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.700]   Like even when I was a dancer,
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.260]   I had Farah as my name and all my friends called me that,
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:12.300]   that I knew from the club or Amara,
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.020]   which is what my family calls me.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.940]   I think like when I have boyfriends,
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.420]   like sometimes we like switch on and off
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.240]   from using Amara or Lana.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.300]   But I just, I really don't notice.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.260]   And sometimes I actually do think that my name is Lana.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.500]   - Huh, that's interesting.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.520]   So what going forward for you, like, is your,
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.760]   like going forward, where do you want to go from here?
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.860]   Like, is it just continue with the,
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.780]   with the OnlyFans stuff and influencer stuff?
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.820]   Or do you have other goals in your life going forward
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.900]   or kind of, where do you go from here?
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.180]   - I just, I want to
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.580]   just keep having something that I'm like impassioned about.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.500]   And right now it's making clothes
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.660]   and just like even designing my own furniture for my house
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.400]   or recently writing,
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.300]   which I never thought that I was good at
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.460]   'cause I dropped out of school in eighth grade.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.300]   But I wrote a few poems on Tumblr and people were like,
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.020]   "Oh my God, you're like such a good writer."
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.920]   And I never thought that I was.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.580]   So that's helped me a lot recently,
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.540]   just like always having a passion.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.060]   And then like, if you can find a way
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.740]   to turn that passion into income,
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.460]   like that's obviously amazing.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.700]   But the most important thing to me
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.780]   is just like being the best mom ever.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.380]   Like that comes first before anything.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.420]   - He looks like his baby daddy.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.000]   - Yeah.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.420]   - Have you ever thought about writing a book?
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.580]   Like, I feel like-
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.300]   - Everyone on Tumblr is telling me to.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.460]   They're like, "You're writing so good.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.740]   You have to write a book."
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.620]   - No, that'd be cool.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.580]   I mean, I don't know if you'd write fiction or nonfiction,
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.960]   but I feel like your story,
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.140]   it is a good story like to get out there.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.660]   Just because I feel like it helps a lot of people.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.100]   When you can hear from a woman like you
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:37:59.960]   who was in the industry,
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.020]   but has so much to say about what it's really like,
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.540]   it can kind of, you know,
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.740]   you can't really watch that stuff
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.900]   and look at these girls the same.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.580]   And I feel like a lot of men like objectify women,
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.740]   you know, it's just like a natural,
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.340]   I don't know if it's definitely not natural,
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.160]   but it's like-
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.000]   - Part of like culture.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.100]   - It's part of the culture now.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.980]   And I feel like a lot of women even nowadays
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.700]   fall into that thinking like,
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.900]   "Oh, this is just how it is.
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.300]   Like men objectify me, this is what I'm gonna do."
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.260]   - Or like they feel like they have to like
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.460]   have sex with men to get love or-
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.220]   - Or you live in LA and it's even like these girls,
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.340]   like I know these girls out here doing anything
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.220]   for acceptance or job opportunities or,
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.060]   and I just think-
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.140]   - Or even like a guy like flies around,
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.620]   they're like, "Oh my God, he bought me a flight.
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.100]   Now I have to have sex with him."
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.340]   Like what? No.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.140]   - You don't think if a dude fly you out,
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.420]   the girl gotta be giving it up?
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.460]   - Fuck no, no.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.620]   I've had a guy buy me a private jet to go somewhere
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.700]   and I didn't hook up with him.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.540]   - He wasn't hot?
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.380]   - No, it's not.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.540]   I have some of the most attractive men I've ever seen.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.380]   - No, I'm saying he wasn't mad,
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.140]   like he wasn't mad that you didn't use.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.500]   - I don't care.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.300]   I'm not doing something that I don't wanna do.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.420]   - No, for sure, I'm just saying like-
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.140]   - Like they can be mad all that they want.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.540]   And if they show that they're mad,
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.300]   then I'm not gonna talk to them anymore.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.540]   So they probably wouldn't.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.780]   - I think dudes that are flying girls out,
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.260]   I think there's definitely an expectation.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.020]   I don't know if it's a good expectation.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.460]   I think if a dude is like,
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.300]   "I'm spending any money on this girl."
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.420]   Like, yeah, like she better be with him.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.100]   - But that's not, the girl should not,
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.660]   like she should feel like she's worth more
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.100]   than whatever money he spent on it.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.140]   And also not feel obligated to give,
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.220]   like going back to like giving someone something
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.580]   that you don't have to give.
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   Like, if you're not 100% sure
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.940]   that you wanna have sex with that person,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.700]   or give your body to that person,
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.700]   or be intimate with them for like,
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.860]   'cause you really want it,
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.260]   and it's like for some other reason,
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.380]   or you're unsure, like you shouldn't,
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.820]   you definitely should not do it.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.860]   - And it's crazy you say that,
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.740]   'cause I had this conversation
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.220]   with some of my teammates the other day on the bus.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.020]   We were talking about like a girl
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.900]   who we would view as like a wifey,
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.700]   or like a girlfriend, like a girl you would cuff
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.220]   versus a girl that you would just hook up with.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:23.980]   And we were like, "Okay, if she's giving it up
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.260]   "the first night, like how would you view her?"
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.780]   And we were all kind of like,
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.220]   "Well, we probably wouldn't wife that girl,
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.540]   "'cause if she's giving it up on the first night,
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.500]   "then she probably has done that multiple times."
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.140]   Then we were like, "Okay, then when is the right time
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.580]   "to give it up, second night, third night,
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.740]   "like for a date, whenever?"
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.060]   And it really is, I think, for these girls out there
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.100]   that think that they should be giving it up
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.700]   when a dude is pressuring them,
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.600]   or he does something nice for 'em,
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.700]   but they really don't have that connection yet.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.540]   Like, dudes aren't gonna view you as a girlfriend,
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.100]   or like, they would never wanna cuff you
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.980]   if you're just giving it up right away.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.820]   So, your advice is really good.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.420]   - If you stand on your ground,
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.740]   and like you respect yourself in that way,
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.620]   like I've honestly never had any problems
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.180]   with guys being mad about it.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.620]   And like, I did porn before,
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.540]   so people automatically assume
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.460]   that I'm going to sleep with people,
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.580]   or that I've slept with all the NBA players
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.080]   that I've hung out with.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.180]   I've never slept with any of them
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.080]   besides the one that I have a kid with.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.760]   But none of these guys have gotten upset with me
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.320]   for not sleeping with them,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.380]   no matter what they had bought me,
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.840]   or we've gone on trips together.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.860]   - They tend to respect you.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   - Yeah, like we end up having a respectful, good friendship.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.100]   - I think, yeah, and I think that these girls nowadays
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.220]   definitely kind of think the opposite.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.140]   They get pressured, or they wanna make a dude happy.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.120]   Or like you said, that you kind of struggle
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.300]   with the people-pleasing thing.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.660]   They think that they gotta make this dude happy.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.060]   But if you really wanna,
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.000]   I don't know what these girls want.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.580]   Some girls just want to be able to say,
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.980]   "Oh, I hooked up with this guy," or whatever.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.980]   But if you're a girl that really wants to be
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   valued by a dude, and not just thought of as a whatever,
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.380]   like an object, like we've been talking about,
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.340]   then it's not always bad to wait a while.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.260]   - Also, you mentioned having a connection.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.440]   So perhaps it's not necessarily like,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.680]   "Oh, she slept with him too early."
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.440]   But say she does sleep with him
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.860]   before they have that connection,
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.540]   and it's not someone that you actually have
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.140]   that chemistry or connection with,
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.740]   then it's not gonna work anyway.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.140]   - You can't force it from having sex with them early.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.060]   - Yeah, that might mess it up even worse.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.060]   But if you wait a while,
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.720]   now even the sex would probably be better,
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.740]   because you actually got to know them as a person.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.460]   - Or you could decide that you don't wanna sleep with them.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.780]   Usually I'll hang out with a guy four times,
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.220]   and on the fourth time, I know if there's someone
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.780]   that I'm going to be in love with and wanna have sex with.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.940]   If it doesn't happen with the fourth time,
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.060]   I'm like, "Okay, I don't like him like that."
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.700]   - How has the dating thing been for you
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:10.140]   since you've kind of left that industry?
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.340]   Is it difficult for you?
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.180]   Is it easy?
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.660]   How does that go?
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:18.660]   - Dating was easier after than when I was younger,
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.540]   because I had more respect for myself.
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.740]   My last relationship was really good,
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.620]   but I ended up getting pregnant two months after.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.040]   And then now I just really don't have time
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.620]   for a relationship.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.220]   I haven't hooked up with anyone since April,
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.940]   which is, I was super in love with that boy,
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.700]   but we're not dating or anything,
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:41.900]   because I don't have time.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.020]   I can't text a boy all day long.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:45.860]   I have to work.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.380]   I have to take care of my kid.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.940]   I'm not gonna go out and leave my child every night
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.060]   to go hang out with you,
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.740]   so I just don't have time right now.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.300]   - Do dudes ever try to hold...
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.100]   'Cause I know dudes are petty.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.060]   Even me, I'm not acting like I'm--
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.180]   - An angel, oh, I know.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.220]   - How do you know?
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.140]   - I've heard your talks, though.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.340]   - Chill.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.460]   No, I'm talking more like,
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:12.500]   do dudes try to hold things over your head from the past?
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.380]   'Cause I know me, I could be messing with a girl,
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.580]   and I hear something about something she did in the past
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.780]   or whatever, and it'll still make me mad.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.300]   I don't know if that's, that's probably not good,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.700]   but it'll still make me mad.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.540]   Do dudes try to hold things over your head?
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.380]   - I mean, that's probably something
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.980]   that you need to work on.
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:30.820]   You know?
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.660]   - Yeah, nah, it is.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.340]   I don't know why, I don't know why I do that.
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.500]   - No, no, it happens.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.660]   How old are you?
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.620]   - 25.
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.900]   - See, you're still so young.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.420]   Like, I used to be-- - How old are you?
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.060]   - I just turned 27.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.620]   But I used to be super jealous, too,
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.260]   and honestly, it changes over time,
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.300]   and you just, when you get older,
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.340]   you have a better understanding
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.500]   of relationships and connections,
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.060]   and I personally, if I ever was to be in a relationship,
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.580]   I would never be like,
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.300]   even though I don't wanna sleep with other people,
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.740]   I'd never be like, oh, you can't sleep with other people,
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.380]   or you have to do this or do that,
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.460]   'cause I personally think that it's way more powerful
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.820]   if you believe that you have this,
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.060]   like, or you're with someone
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.740]   that you have a really special connection with
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.940]   that you know they can't find somewhere else,
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.980]   and it's more powerful if someone,
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.900]   like, they have the options to do whatever they want,
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.500]   but they always choose you.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.340]   - 100%.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.660]   - You know, so that's kind of like what,
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.220]   having that mindset got rid of that jealousy
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.300]   and insecurity that I used to have.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.300]   But guys have held it over my head.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.380]   Me and my ex, we got in a really, like,
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.140]   crazy fight one night,
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.700]   and actually, I've had two boyfriends say this to me.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.500]   They would say, no one's ever going to love you
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   because you did porn and you're a whore.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.340]   - Seriously? - And, yeah.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.460]   - So then why would they,
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:49.700]   if that's really what they thought,
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.540]   do you just not love them? - Well, 'cause they try
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.620]   to tell you, like, oh, I'm the only one
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.900]   that's ever gonna love you, so you have to stay with me.
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.980]   - They're toxic, not me. - Yeah.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.060]   - Yeah, no. - That's crazy, yeah.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.500]   Nah, I definitely, as I've gotten older,
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.300]   I've realized, when I was watching a podcast,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.500]   I think with, do you know a girl named Brittany Rayner?
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.500]   Do you know who that is? - Oh, yeah, no, I love her.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.300]   - I was watching a podcast,
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.940]   I think she was on there with Andrew Tate.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:17.060]   I was watching the podcast, and she was talking about,
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.020]   just, you know, she's done some things in the past,
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.340]   but she's not doing 'em anymore,
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.740]   and, like, are women, like, redeemable,
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.020]   like, in the eyes of men, like,
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.620]   if they've done things in the past,
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.580]   and now they're a whole different person,
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.220]   like, you know, like you, or, I don't know,
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.380]   she's changed what she was doing, but, like, her,
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.380]   and I think Andrew Tate said something, like,
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.540]   it just depends on the dude, like, or something,
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.820]   I forget exactly what he said,
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.540]   but I think, like, the right dude, you know,
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:47.620]   obviously, in a mature man, you know, for me,
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.820]   I've had to think about, like, why do I get so mad
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.940]   about something that the girl might've did in the past,
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.340]   or who she was messing with in the past,
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.940]   because, and I'm a dude who--
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.500]   - She had no idea she was gonna meet you in the future.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.660]   - And I've done wild stuff in the past, too,
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.180]   so if a girl was gonna hold that over my head,
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.180]   then I would be in trouble,
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.460]   because I've done some wild stuff,
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.820]   and I've definitely been a dude,
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.620]   back in the day, who had, like, double standards,
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.060]   like, oh, I can have a crazy past,
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.220]   but she can't have any type of past,
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.700]   so I'm not messing with her.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.220]   But I think, like you said, as you get older,
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.380]   and you see people, like, for who they are,
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.460]   and you kinda, like, meet 'em where they're at,
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.940]   like, if you fall in love with this person,
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.900]   or you like this person, you gotta accept them
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.540]   for who they are, and what they've done, and--
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.180]   - Yeah, 'cause that's what made them
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.100]   the person that you love. - Exactly, 100%.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   - All the experiences that they had.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.060]   - 100%, so I definitely think that's something
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.620]   that comes with maturity.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.500]   But, nah, I really appreciate you coming on.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.060]   I don't like to keep people on here that long.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.380]   I just, you know, people that I find either inspirational,
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.100]   or people that I'm just curious about their stories,
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.220]   or whatever, I like to have 'em on here,
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.940]   and just ask a few questions that I'm curious about,
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.060]   and then let 'em go.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.500]   So I appreciate you. - Curious Mike.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.380]   - I appreciate you helping on the podcast.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.660]   - Was it inspired by Curious George?
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.340]   - Sierra came up with it, she,
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.900]   'cause I've always just been a curious dude.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.580]   I'd always ask wild questions, and just speak my mind,
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:14.020]   and honestly, the podcast kinda came about
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.420]   because you know how people on the internet are,
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.820]   and if you tweet something that's kinda, like,
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.540]   against the norm, or you Instagram something,
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.980]   you get crucified, and people don't even know
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.380]   what you were talking about, they don't know context.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.100]   They'll take a tweet, or whatever, and blow it up.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.500]   So I was like, what if I came out with a podcast,
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.300]   and I could have unfiltered conversations,
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.260]   or conversations that people are kinda scared to have,
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.900]   or whatever, and just be open?
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.060]   'Cause I feel like, you know, that creates a space
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.980]   for understanding, and more, so that's kinda how I--
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.620]   - Yeah, you can hope so.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.220]   Some people never will, though.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.380]   You can hope so that people understand,
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:51.500]   but sometimes they never will.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.180]   - Right, nah, and you gotta accept that.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.700]   But nah, I appreciate you, Lana.
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.540]   - Thank you.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.340]   - For sure, Curious Mike out.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.540]   (laughing)
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.300]   (upbeat music)
