[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   One night, we went to Cocktail Barn, which is actually a really cool cocktail bar.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   Like, not speakeasy in that it's hidden, but really kind of creative, high-end cocktails.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.000]   They had an entire train car inside the restaurant.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.040]   One of them said the ingredient was electricity.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.440]   I don't know what that means, but it was absolutely delicious.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.320]   But we had a lot of people join us that night.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.920]   It was like a free afternoon in Reykjavik on the tour.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.000]   And a bunch of people just all, even though we'd all been hanging out together
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.840]   nonstop, we still were enjoying each other's company so much that we checked out a bar together.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.800]   And then from there, we ended up going to Sumac for dinner, which was phenomenal.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.160]   Yeah, it might be one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in a long time.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.200]   And the chef has another restaurant called Ox, which is like a fixed price, multi-course.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.480]   I think they have exactly 17 seats, pretty high-end expensive experience.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.840]   And then also this other restaurant, which is like Icelandic food and ingredients
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.120]   merged with Middle Eastern flavors and highly recommend.
