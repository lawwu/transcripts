[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220]   My wife, Amy, loves to bake.
[00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.800]   Sometimes there's banana bread.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.560]   Sometimes there's cookies and all kinds of stuff.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.500]   And I don't have a lot of self-control.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.120]   And so instead of saying no, which just doesn't work for me that well, I say yes in five minutes.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.380]   I find that if there's three dozen cookies sitting on the counter and I say, hey, I can have one of these.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.560]   I just have to wait five minutes.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.400]   In that five-minute period, I've moved on.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.620]   I've gone to do something.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.220]   And I've completely forgotten about the cookie.
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.880]   Now, maybe I come back.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.000]   Maybe I repeat the thing.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.640]   Maybe I reward myself with a cookie.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.380]   But it's such a benefit to me and has prevented me from binge eating a lot of cookies, which is something that I often have found myself doing in the past.
