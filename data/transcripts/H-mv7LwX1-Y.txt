[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.880]   Well, we finished the week of episodes on preaching
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.800]   with another question from a seasoned preacher
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.940]   who wishes to remain anonymous.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.140]   And it's a question a lot of people, I think,
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.580]   wanna ask you, Pastor John,
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.760]   and I'm surprised we haven't gotten around to it yet.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.200]   Here it is, Pastor John,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   can a sermon be too short or too long?
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.420]   How can we know the ideal sermon length?
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.960]   Is there a single length for all?
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   Should some be shorter, some be longer?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400]   If so, when, how would you talk to preachers
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.760]   about how long the sermon should be?
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.760]   No, there is no one length the sermon should be
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.840]   that's ideal for every situation.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.540]   Yes, some sermons should be shorter and some longer.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.300]   Yes, it is possible that a sermon be too long or too short.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.960]   Those are my answers.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.580]   Now, let me give some factors
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.280]   that we should just take into consideration
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480]   when we're pondering, okay, how long should I preach?
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400]   Factor number one, I would say that vastly more important
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.760]   than length is whether the sermon is faithful
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.760]   to the biblical text and rich with God-glorifying,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.640]   soul-transforming truth.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.960]   Far better to have a truth-laden,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.840]   Christ-exalting, textually faithful, clearly spoken,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.680]   deeply felt 10-minute homily
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.920]   than to have a totally fascinating,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.920]   biblically vacuous, textually unrooted, story-laden
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.740]   piece of inspirational moralism that lasts for an hour.
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.740]   Substance is vastly more important than length.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.880]   But of course, if there is soul-nourishing,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.000]   Christ-exalting, mind-engaging substance,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.840]   10 minutes will ordinarily be too short.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.220]   Okay, that's factor number one.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.220]   Number two, another factor is the nature
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.600]   of the biblical text.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.680]   We are trying to communicate to our hearers
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   how long is the text, how complex is the text.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.080]   Longer texts may require longer sermons.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.240]   Not always, but they might.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.720]   And the more complex the text is,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.140]   the more time it takes to make it clear
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.660]   and compelling in practical ways for people.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.520]   The logic of some texts and the vocabulary of some texts
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   demand closer attention and therefore more time.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.720]   Factor number three, take into consideration
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.520]   the nature of the audience.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.600]   Are they unbelievers?
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.720]   Did they choose to be there?
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.400]   Or was there some kind of compulsion?
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.680]   Thinking like maybe some chapel setting.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.460]   How old are they?
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.240]   If they're believers, how mature are they?
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.440]   What are they used to?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.700]   How well have they been taught?
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.400]   What have they been trained in?
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.680]   How tired are they?
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.120]   Is this late night service?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.080]   They've been working all day?
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.140]   All of these will affect the length of the sermon.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.240]   But I would add that over time,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.560]   a pastor may train his people to love
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.920]   the preaching of the word of God
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.880]   so that they will be unsatisfied
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.120]   with a mere 20 or 30 minute message
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.160]   if they are being fed rich food
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.040]   that holds their attention and satisfies their souls.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.120]   Number four, factor number four to take into consideration,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.000]   consider your gifts as a preacher.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Some people are so, some speakers are so compelling
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.800]   to listen to that the time goes by so quickly
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.320]   that you hardly even know it's gone.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.440]   And we need to know ourselves
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.580]   and the kind of response we are getting from our people.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.360]   Can we hold their attention for 45 minutes
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.160]   or do we not have that gift?
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.120]   Factor number five, what's the situation
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.880]   in which the message is being given?
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.160]   Is it a wedding?
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.320]   Probably, keep it short.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.800]   I mean, this is one of the hardest situations
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.920]   in which to preach because people frankly
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.040]   are looking at the bridegroom or the bride
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.880]   and the wedding party and their hair
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.440]   and their dresses and oh, good grief.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.040]   And you're supposed to be connecting them
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.160]   with the living God.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.160]   Well, I would much rather preach a funeral than a wedding.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.000]   I'll mention why maybe in a minute.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.360]   But here again, know your audience.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.120]   There are some weddings where the spiritual maturity
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.400]   is so deep that they want a rich feast
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.100]   about the glories of covenant married love.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   At funerals, people are usually tender and hungry
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.280]   for truth, some strong, clear word from God
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.080]   about death and hope and resurrection.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   However, even here, the emotional nature of the day
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   is such that a long drawn out service can be uncharitable.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.160]   Preaching out of doors at the quad, at the university
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.620]   may call for something shorter than Sunday morning
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.240]   to the people of God.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   Preaching at a businessman's gathering once a week
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.000]   over the lunch hour will probably demand
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.640]   a 20 or 30 minute limitation.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.080]   Having three services on Sunday morning
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   with difficulty clearing the parking lot
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.400]   between services is gonna affect the sermon length.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.280]   And never forget the dear nursery workers.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.800]   Yeah, they get the most important job
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.920]   according to Mark 9 37.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.760]   Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.840]   Good night.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.680]   That's the most awesome verse in the Bible
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.880]   for a nursery worker.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.800]   Remember them too.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.520]   But I would end by simply saying that what I have found
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.400]   in particular, my particular cultural setting
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.760]   after years of experience with the same people
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   is that both they and I would be frustrated
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.840]   if I didn't take the time while preaching
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   to do the serious explanatory work of exposition
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.620]   as well as appropriate application.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.620]   And in my experience, this simply seldom could be done
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.720]   in less than 40 minutes, more often 50.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.920]   And that's just where we settled in as a church
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.040]   and I mentioned it for consideration.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.800]   And it seems to me as I look around the nation
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.280]   that there are many hundreds, maybe thousands
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.560]   of growing churches where pastors preach,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.240]   rich, Christ exalting, God-centered, Bible saturated,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.320]   textually rooted, intellectually challenging,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.240]   emotionally moving, life altering sermons
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.240]   for 50 or more minutes and very few people get frustrated
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.520]   that they are too long.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.280]   It is a mark of immaturity in a congregation
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.760]   if we live by the clock in such a limiting way
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.120]   that we don't give time for extended lingering
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   in the presence of God in singing
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.580]   and lingering in the presence of God
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.320]   in expository exaltation.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.520]   So know yourself, know your people,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.200]   know your text, know the situation
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.840]   and pack as much as you can into the time you have
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.680]   for the glory of God and the good of your people.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.600]   - Yeah, such a good episode on Preaching Length.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.800]   Thank you, Pastor John, for your decades
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.080]   of thinking about these things.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.120]   And this closes out our week of episodes on preaching,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.240]   celebrating the new book by John Piper
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.120]   titled Expository Exaltation.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.780]   Preaching is the theme of this new book
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.060]   which caps a 1,000-page trilogy of books
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.040]   which answer three really critical questions.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.360]   Question number one, can we trust the Bible?
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.480]   That was answered in book number one, A Peculiar Glory.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.740]   And then question number two,
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.520]   how should I go about reading the Bible
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.340]   to get God's meaning?
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.920]   That was answered in book number two,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.840]   Reading the Bible Supernaturally.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.180]   And now finally, question three,
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.040]   what should I expect from my church and from my pastors
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.480]   when they proclaim this book to me?
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.160]   That's answered in book number three, now out,
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.360]   titled Expository Exaltation,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.520]   Christian Preaching as Worship.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.680]   Well, speaking of sermons,
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.160]   Sunday marks the 18th anniversary
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.200]   of one of John Piper's most famous sermons ever,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.280]   the Don't Waste Your Life sermon,
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.340]   also known as the Seashells sermon,
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.300]   which was delivered outdoors in Memphis
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.080]   at a Passion Conference gathering on May 20th, 2000,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.780]   18 years ago.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.680]   And I'm gonna ask John Piper to reflect on the occasion
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.560]   and the book that resulted, Don't Waste Your Life.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.880]   I cannot wait for this episode, but I must.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.160]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:21.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
