[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [intro music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Christ has triumphed over Satan and over every power and principality.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   He did this through his death and through his resurrection from the dead,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   and so why does Satan still exist to exert his rage?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   It's a question Pastor John addressed in a Q&A setting several years back.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   "If God is sovereign, then it's clear that he could destroy Satan at any time.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Why does God allow Satan to live?"
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Let's make sure that we agree that it's true,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   that God could take him out any time he chose,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   because I think there's some who would say
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   he really can't because of rights or authority or independence or free will that Satan has.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   But the reason I know he can take him out
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   without turning me into an automaton or breaking any rules is because he's going to take him out.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   He's going to throw him into the lake of fire.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And the question is, why didn't he do it yesterday?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   If he had done it yesterday, I wouldn't be tempted the way I am today.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And the Bible says, "Lead me not into temptation."
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Well, the best way not to be led into temptation is to take the tempter away.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Isn't it? Take him out!
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I've got sin in my life of plenty to get me to have a struggle.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I don't need Satan on top of this sin that I have to make my life miserable.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So God, take him out because you have a right to take him out.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   You have the power to take him out.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   You're doing nobody wrong when you take him out.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Take him out!
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And he doesn't do it.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Why?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Now, the Bible doesn't answer why directly.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And so, it's kind of inferences that we go on.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   But here's my best shot.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   God has ordained that Satan have a long leash,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   with God holding on to the leash,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   because he knows that when we walk in and out of those temptations,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   struggling both with the physical effects that they bring and the moral effects that they bring,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   more of God's glory will shine in that battle than if he took him out yesterday.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   There will be evidences of God's patience with us as we struggle with sin,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   evidences of his mercy to us as we struggle with sin,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   evidences of his sustaining grace through horrific physical suffering
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   that Satan was the immediate cause of.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It says that in the Bible.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   This woman was struck by Satan.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   For, what, 18 years she had this bent over back.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And Satan was doing it.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   God was ordaining that he be allowed to do it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And all of that, that the glory of God, his mercy, his justice, his grace, his wisdom,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   would shine more brightly.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And we can argue with that.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We can say, "I don't agree.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I don't think God should run the world this way."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And if we ultimately disagree, then we will reject God,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   we'll reject the biblical testimony, and we will perish forever in hell.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And I choose to trust him that his way of managing the devil
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and managing evil that comes at me is wiser than the way I might choose to manage it.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And perhaps the other thing I should say is that he sent his son
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   right into the middle of this satanic warfare.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And it was Satan that put it in the heart of Judas to betray him.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   So Jesus exposes himself to the horrors of Satan's deceit and lie and murder.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   He's a murderer from the beginning and a liar.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And dies in order, it says in Colossians 2.15,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   to make a public display of the principalities and powers in his defeat of them.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   There is more glory that will come to Jesus Christ
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   because of suffering to destroy Satan than powerfully shooting Satan in the head.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And there's more glory that will come to Jesus Christ
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   by our sharing in the sufferings of Christ,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   holding onto his supreme value,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   than if we had been able to say, "Satan, depart!"
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and never have another problem.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And I think the reason for that, this is my ultimate final answer,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I think the reason for that is the glory of God shines most brightly,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   the glory of Christ shines most brightly
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   when we are seen to be supremely satisfied in Christ
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   in spite of Satan's torments, which exist,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   rather than having those torments removed and liking Jesus because of it.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's when you love Jesus in spite of it and through it
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   that his glory shines the most brightly,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   rather than when we have life made easier for us by his removal
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   and we like Jesus because of it.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   That was Pastor John in a Q&A setting several years back.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And related to this, two other Ask Pastor John episodes
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   deal with the nature and existence of Satan.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   See episode #204, "Does it make God evil to ordain evil?"
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and episode #280, "Does God cause all sickness?"
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   You can find these episodes in the Ask Pastor John archive.
