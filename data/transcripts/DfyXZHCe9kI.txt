[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, let my people go."
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.240]   Such a classic movie moment from Charlton Heston playing Moses in the 1956 movie The
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.480]   Ten Commandments.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:21.440]   The exodus of Israel out of Egypt is the greatest redemptive event in the Old Testament.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.000]   Let that sink in for a moment.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.680]   If our publishing age is marked by the cross, it is because the cross is shorthand for the
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800]   death and resurrection of Christ.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.720]   His cross marks the centerpiece of redemptive history as we know it.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.600]   But before the cross, there was the exodus.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.160]   And so if the world of publishing today talks a lot about the cross-centered life and the
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.520]   cross-centered church, it would seem that a fitting analogy would be perhaps to imagine
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.040]   the Old Testament era saints to have had the impulse to write and publish books on the
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.280]   exodus-centered life and the exodus-centered synagogue.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.920]   It's a major key to understanding the Old Testament and it's a major key to unlocking
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.600]   the meaning of the entire biblical plotline.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.120]   To explain, I called Dr. Don Carson.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.600]   On occasional Fridays, I call him up as part of our relationship with our friends at The
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.760]   Gospel Coalition.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.120]   Carson is the co-founder and president of The Gospel Coalition and also the editor of
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   the NIV Zondervan Study Bible, which is the study Bible version of what we're doing in
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.560]   these occasional Friday podcasts.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.880]   I called up Dr. Carson, asked him to explain the exodus.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.360]   Here's what he said.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.360]   The exodus is simultaneously the escape of the people of God, the Israelites, from Egypt,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.560]   the land of slavery.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.920]   They exit out of slavery into the promised land.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.200]   It's the exodus.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.320]   And at the same time, it's a one-word way of referring to the events surrounding the
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080]   exodus.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.160]   That includes, therefore, the judgment of God on the Egyptians, the plagues.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.920]   It includes also, eventually, the giving of the law, the years of wilderness wanderings,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.800]   and eventually, entrance into the promised land.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.280]   So sometimes when people speak of the exodus, they are referring to the narrow event of
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.920]   the escape.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.640]   And sometimes they're referring to the much larger event that includes, for example, the
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.520]   giving of the law and the revelation of God at Sinai, and the whole Mosaic Code.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.400]   So one has to be careful as to how the word is used in a particular theological context.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.080]   What is clear is that in the Old Testament, the exodus is bound up with at least two huge
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.920]   controlling themes.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.240]   The first is that in some ways, this is the reconstitution of the Israelites.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.960]   The beginning of the Hebrew-Israelite heritage is, of course, with Abraham.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.040]   And God makes a covenant with him, which we have subsequently called the Abrahamic Covenant,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.840]   which itself could be nicely traced through the Old Testament and into the New in a variety
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.840]   of ways.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.440]   But at that point, the land promises, for example, are still referring to things way
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.280]   off in the future.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.080]   And even when Abraham does finally have a son, and the son begets two more sons, and
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.880]   one of them begets 12 patriarchs and so forth, yet this fledgling people is not in any sense
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.880]   a nation.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.760]   And before they become a nation, they end up in Egypt at the time of the famine, where
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.400]   in the providence of God, Joseph provides all the food they need, until hundreds of
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.680]   years later, they are enslaved, and they have never been a nation.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.280]   So the exodus then reconstitutes them, as it were, but this time making them a nation.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.480]   So this is not only an exit from slavery and from Egypt, it is reconstituting the people
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.400]   with a new covenant, the Sinai Covenant, or the Mosaic Covenant, or the Law Covenant,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.120]   as it's variously called, and gaining entrance into the Promised Land and the beginnings
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.680]   of their pilgrimage as a nation.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.440]   That's the first thing that is obvious right on the surface of the text.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:27.800]   The second thing that is stunning is how the exodus controls a great deal of the discussion
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.080]   of the entire rest of the Old Testament.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.720]   And for example, the way the Ten Commandments begin in Exodus chapter 20, "And God spoke
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.640]   all these words, 'I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.640]   of slavery.'
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.200]   And then the commandments begin, 'You shall have no other gods before me.'"
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.040]   So although the commandment to worship God and adhere to him is sometimes grounded in
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.760]   creation, God's sovereign, providential, kingly rule, he is their maker and their judge.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.120]   Here, in this case, it's grounded in their redemption, that is, their redemption from
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.540]   slavery.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:15.300]   And that becomes the basis for a very large number of prophetic appeals for psalmic meditation
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.760]   and so on.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:25.120]   And it's striking that God has freed them, he has led them out, and on that basis, then,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.600]   he then gives them law and instruction.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.280]   It's not that he gives them instruction and if they obey the law adequately, then God
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.620]   will spare them.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.720]   He reaches down sovereignly and saves them, in fact, from slavery and leads them out.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.640]   And in the course of doing so, then, says, "I am the God who has freed you from the land
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   of slavery.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.160]   Here, then, is the covenant I impose.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.040]   Here is the contract, as it were, the covenant that I make."
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.320]   And that way of thinking returns again and again and again.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.040]   In every part of Scripture, I have in front of me literally scores of passages that I've
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.200]   accumulated over the years on that point.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.360]   Let me pick up just a couple of them so that you can get a feel for this.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.520]   Here is Psalm 77, beginning at 13.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.400]   "Your ways, God, are holy.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.680]   What God is as great as our God?
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.820]   You are the God who performs miracles.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.680]   You display your power among the peoples.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.400]   With your mighty arm, you redeemed your people."
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.920]   That's a reference to the Exodus.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.520]   "The descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.920]   The waters saw you, God.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.400]   The waters saw you and writhed.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.520]   The very depths were convulsed.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.960]   The clouds poured down water.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.800]   The heavens resounded with thunder.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.440]   Your arrows flashed back and forth.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.640]   Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.960]   Your lightning lit up the world.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.880]   The earth trembled and quaked.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.460]   Your path led through the sea.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.900]   Your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.720]   You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron."
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.600]   The specificity of Moses and Aaron and leading the people through the mighty waters and that
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.280]   sort of thing is transparently referring to the crossing of the Red Sea and the like.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.640]   And that sort of thing happens again and again and again.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.440]   That's Psalm 77.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.400]   Psalm 78 has a similar passage.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:28.680]   But then prophetic warnings can be cast with reference to the Exodus likewise.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.920]   For example, in Jeremiah 7, 21, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says,
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.300]   "Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.720]   For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.320]   commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, but I gave them this command, 'Obey me and
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.600]   I will be your God and you will be my people.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.060]   Walk in obedience to all I command you that it may go well with you.'
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.380]   But they did not listen or pay attention.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.540]   Instead they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.500]   They went backward and not forward.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.300]   From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again, I sent
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.700]   you my servants, the prophets, but they did not listen to me or pay attention.
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.100]   They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors."
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.580]   And so on and so on.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:23.800]   You find similar passages in Isaiah and Ezekiel and in the minor prophets and so forth.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:29.080]   And then later on, when it's a question of coming back from the exile, the exile being
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.040]   a kind of, the return from exile being a kind of mini-Exodus all over again, then in the
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:42.440]   prayers of confession in Nehemiah, for example, Nehemiah chapter 9, again there's reference
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.960]   back to the Exodus as the great redemptive turning point in the people's history from
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.680]   which they have strayed.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.400]   So the Exodus is the greatest redemptive event in the Old Testament to which all subsequent
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.480]   Old Testament revelation points again and again and again.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:08.520]   And sometimes it's, the references are in elusive language.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.560]   There's the very famous passage, of course, from Hosea chapter 11, "Out of Egypt I called
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   my son."
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.360]   The first reference there, of course, is quite clearly to Israel.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:27.400]   As early as Daniel chapter, as Exodus chapter 4, God says, "Israel is my firstborn son."
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.340]   And I say, "Let my son go."
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.800]   That is in the Exodus, that he may worship me.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.940]   And then centuries later, Hosea records God's words, "Out of Egypt I called my son," looking
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.560]   back on the event.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.960]   So that's all part of the background that dominates the Old Testament storyline before
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.000]   you get to the New Testament.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.560]   Then in the New Testament, it's not long before this is picked up.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:59.440]   In Matthew chapter 2, for example, Jesus is transported down to Egypt by his mother and
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.760]   his stand-in father, escaping the wrath of Herod, and then eventually returns.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.560]   And this, we're told, fulfills the word, "Out of Egypt have I called my son," referring
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.320]   to Hosea chapter 11.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:21.400]   And what is being established there is what might be called an Israel typology.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.480]   The ultimate Israel is Jesus himself.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.480]   And that's why, for example, in Matthew chapter 4, when Jesus is led by the Spirit into the
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:39.880]   desert to be tempted by the devil, he quotes Deuteronomy two or three times.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.280]   In one passage, for example, he says, "Man does not live by bread alone, but by every
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.160]   word that proceeds from the mouth of God."
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.500]   That, of course, is directly from Deuteronomy chapter 8, given to the people of Israel.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.440]   The people of Israel heard that word, but unfortunately did not value God's word even
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.400]   more highly than their own food.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.560]   But Jesus, the ultimate Israel, does.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:09.320]   And so Jesus turns out to be, in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the ultimate Adam, but also
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.040]   the ultimate Israel, and also the ultimate David.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:21.440]   And on the Israel side, then, quite clearly to apply Hosea chapter 11, 1 to him, means
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.880]   that the son language is purposely being used in a slightly different way.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.280]   Or the most striking passage is perhaps Luke chapter 9, verse 31.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:40.400]   This is the account in Luke's Gospel of the Transfiguration, Luke 9, 28 and following.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:48.280]   And as part of that spectacular event, we're told, "Two men," verse 30, "Moses and Elijah,
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.200]   appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.920]   They spoke about his departure."
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.180]   The word is exodus.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.800]   And there are other ways of talking about departure.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.240]   To speak of this as the exodus is meant to be evocative.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.280]   It's meant to call the biblically literate reader's mind back to the exodus.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.120]   So Jesus, as the ultimate Israel, is going to depart.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.880]   He's going to leave.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.400]   He's going to exit.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.840]   And we begin to see what it means to bear 20 verses later, when in 9.51 we read, "As
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.920]   the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven," that's his departure, "through
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.440]   the cross, the burial, the resurrection, and the ascension."
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   Taken up to heaven.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.880]   As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.960]   Jerusalem.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.000]   And then from there on, and this is chapter 9, you're barely a third of the way through
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.600]   the Book of Luke.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.400]   From there on, you're reminded five times that Jesus has resolutely set his face to
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   Jerusalem.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's sometimes called Luke's travel narrative.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.320]   And that is put in your face again and again and again until he arrives in Jerusalem in
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.000]   chapter 19.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.380]   And so that everything that is said and done, all the parables, all the miracles, everything
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:23.480]   that is said and done is under the impending, anticipated exodus.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:31.160]   His travel to Jerusalem means he is heading for the cross, the resurrection, the ascension.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   His exodus as the true Israel, taking his people, as it were, in triumphant array into
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.300]   the new heaven and the new earth.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:51.260]   So this becomes part of the way of thinking of Christ as the one who effects our exodus,
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.100]   likewise from sin and judgment, and bringing us into the promised land.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:02.460]   And that's why, without even pausing for a blink of an eye, the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:08.860]   5, 6 and following, can say, "Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us."
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:15.180]   Well, the Passover, of course, is what takes place at the time of the exodus.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.660]   The people of God are instructed to sacrifice the Passover lamb, put the blood of the lamb
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.860]   on the doorposts and the lintel.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:29.260]   Those in the house are safe, but everywhere else, families lose their firstborn son.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:35.460]   Now Christ is our Passover in that he is guaranteed that the angel of wrath, the destruction of
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.300]   right judgment, passes over us because Christ is born in our place.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.100]   This is an exodus theme.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.540]   And then sometimes the exodus theme plays out slightly differently.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:56.800]   In 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and in Hebrews 3, 7 and following, we discover that the people
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.380]   of God at the time of the exodus, the Israelites, constitute a kind of moralizing lesson for
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.380]   us.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.700]   They escaped from, but they did not get into.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.820]   That is, God rescued them from the land of slavery.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:18.300]   But that first generation, 20 and older, they died in the desert because of unbelief and
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.940]   disobedience.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.680]   So they never did get into the promised land.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.660]   It was the next generation that got into the promised land.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:32.340]   And so both 1 Corinthians 10 and Hebrews 3 draws an applicable moralizing point for the
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.740]   people of God today.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.020]   Make sure that you persevere to the end.
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.860]   Don't fall away for lack of perseverance.
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:44.260]   Hebrews 3, 14 goes so far as to say that we are made sharers in Christ.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:49.420]   We are truly Christians if we hold our beginning confidence, our beginning conviction, our
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:55.460]   beginning faith steadfastly to the end, which is precisely what so many of the Israelites
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.200]   did not do at the time of the exodus.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.380]   So there are all of these sorts of connections.
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:09.060]   But now, of course, the New Testament Christians look back at their great redemptive event,
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:15.900]   even greater by far than the event of the first exodus, namely the cross, resurrection,
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:22.580]   and ascension, which is the exodus of Jesus himself as the ultimate Israel in whom we,
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.260]   the people of God, Jew and Gentile alike, are caught up.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:32.420]   Let me mention two things.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:38.180]   This theme shows up in not only specific texts like the ones I've mentioned, and I've mentioned
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.120]   only a small handful of them, but in subtle ways.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:53.380]   For example, in Mark's Gospel, there was for many, many decades an ongoing, lingering debate
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:17:01.140]   about whether Mark constantly refers elusively to the exodus of the Old Testament.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.500]   And one side said, "Yes, yes, the themes are transparently there.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.680]   They're on the surface of the text."
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:13.340]   And the other side said, "Yes, but every time that he seems to be talking about these exodus
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:20.200]   themes, in fact, he could use the language of the Old Testament, the Greek Septuagint,
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:27.460]   he could use that language, but in fact, he seems almost to avoid it.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.080]   He writes his own way, choosing his own words.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.100]   If he really wants to make an allusion to the Old Testament exodus narrative, why doesn't
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.740]   he use the actual words drawn from exodus?"
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.140]   And so the debate went back and forth.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.540]   But a friend of mine nailed it.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.740]   It was about 20 years ago now.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.100]   He did a doctoral dissertation at Cambridge.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.180]   His name was Ricky Watts.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:58.640]   And what he shows, in my view, very convincingly, is that the exodus themes are truly there,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.780]   but the language is Isaiah's.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:06.540]   That is, Isaiah picks up on the exodus theme again and again and again, sometimes referring
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:16.620]   to it in the past, and sometimes using it as a way of talking about the impending exile,
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.740]   where because of sin the people are going to be cast out of the land again and be drawn
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.340]   back by God.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.780]   This is all exodus motif, but now in Isaiah's words.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:34.220]   And when Mark refers to the exodus themes, he does so repeatedly, using Isaiah's words.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:40.120]   And what that suggests, then, is that, born along by the Spirit of God, Mark, in writing
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:48.820]   Scripture, is thinking profoundly, he's thinking in a way that we would call biblical theological.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.860]   He's seeing the trajectories in Scripture himself, and he's choosing to use the words
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.380]   of Isaiah, knowing full well that they're referring back, in the first instance, all
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.540]   the way to the exodus itself.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.380]   And that becomes the matrix out of which he talks about what Christ is doing.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.120]   In other words, these trajectories that we find through Scripture, by the time you get
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:17.020]   to the New Testament, you find again and again that the New Testament writers themselves
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.660]   have seen the trajectories and are working from them, thinking about them, using language
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.780]   that reflects them, and so on.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.980]   So that all of these things become ultimately a spectacular way of anticipating and pointing
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:37.220]   to the greatest redemption from slavery imaginable, as God's people are prepared by Christ's
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.380]   exodus to enter into the promised land of the new heaven and the new earth, the home
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.740]   of righteousness.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:48.180]   The last thing I'll mention is that this exodus theme has, in the last 40 years, been
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.300]   used in another way that we should at least be aware of.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:56.700]   It's not nearly as dominant now as it once was, but in an era of global theology, it's
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.360]   still pretty important.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.000]   About 40 years ago, there was, first of all in Latin America, then it spread elsewhere,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.660]   the rise of what came to be called "liberation theology."
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:19.260]   It was promulgated by a number of Spanish-speaking, occasionally Portuguese-speaking, largely
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:24.060]   Catholic, somewhat liberal theologians.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:30.700]   They saw the injustices in the land, the extreme poverty, the corruption, and so on, and they
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:40.540]   looked for biblical warrants to escape all of this, and they settled on the exodus.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:46.860]   This included people like Gustavo Gutierrez, a chap called José Bonino, and a number of
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.500]   others, some of whose works were eventually published in English, although some of them
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.340]   remained only in Spanish.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:21:01.680]   They started Bible studies and action groups and so on, largely in the Catholic Church,
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.700]   in terms of what they call themselves "liberation theology," a theology of liberation.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:15.500]   What they meant by this was that the account of God saving his people from slavery at the
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:21.020]   time of the exodus ought to become a kind of paradigm event for the people of Latin
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:27.980]   America to escape their oppression and slavery at the hands of endless, petty dictators and
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.300]   corrupt politicians and governments and so on.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.940]   And if you ask them, "What warrants you choosing that particular story?
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.420]   Why are you basing all of your theology on the exodus account?"
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.580]   Then their argument was what they called "praxis."
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:50.580]   That is, this is where we are in our life, and the demands of where we are must be aligned
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:58.100]   most closely with a biblical account that gives us hope and a pattern for escape.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:04.180]   And so the ultimate control of what story prevails to warrant liberation theology is
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:10.060]   itself not shaped by reading Scripture as a whole, but shaped by the experience of the
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.660]   people by praxis.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.740]   And eventually, evangelicals were a little late to get into that discussion, but eventually
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.320]   there was some serious reflection upon it.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.940]   The question can be raised, "What warrants that story?"
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.980]   as opposed to, let's say, the story that's taking place at the time of Jeremiah, where
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:32.620]   what God is telling the people through the prophet Jeremiah is, "Stay where you are.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.940]   Don't rebel.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:40.980]   The Babylonians that are oppressing you and taking over, they are God's messengers to
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.980]   chastise you.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.740]   Don't rebel against them, because then the destruction of Jerusalem will be all the worse."
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:53.020]   And so the question then becomes, biblically, what warrants choosing the Exodus account,
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:59.340]   where you end up with liberation, versus the Jeremiah account, where you end up being told
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.500]   to stay where you are, and if you head for liberation, you're rebelling against God
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.500]   Almighty.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.380]   And the answer again and again was simply praxis.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:15.180]   But what was seen eventually by a lot of evangelicals who were wrestling with these things was that
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.900]   the Exodus account needs to be put within the framework of the entire biblical storyline,
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.660]   a whole biblical theology.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:30.620]   And the ultimate liberation is achieved by that to which the Exodus points, namely, Christ
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.860]   himself.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:38.540]   Otherwise, one can go through the Scripture and pick up a story that seems to fit best
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.820]   my circumstances and merely apply it without further thought, without seeing what other
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.220]   stories might apply that seem to run in a different direction.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.500]   In other words, the stories of Scripture have to be fit within the context of the Bible's
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.980]   storyline itself.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:58.260]   Otherwise, we're constantly controlling Scripture by focusing on our situation and
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:04.780]   randomly taking passages and applying them to ourselves.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:12.220]   So in this connection, the proper use of Exodus is shaped not only by how Exodus functions
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:18.340]   in the Old Testament, but how it's picked up and is completed by what is disclosed in
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.500]   the New Testament.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:26.020]   Even in the Old Testament, however, the Exodus account looks a bit different from what Gutierrez
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.940]   and Bonino were arguing for.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.940]   After all, God takes action for his people in the Exodus.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.060]   They seem rather slow to latch on.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:40.700]   Every time there's a discouragement, they're ready to abandon ship.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:50.260]   It's not as if the people were incited to revolution and revolt and thus kick off into
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.980]   some new adventure and seek out a promised land.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.980]   Rather, God reaches down and saves them, which is not exactly what Gutierrez and Bonino had
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:24:59.980]   in mind.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.940]   So, in other words, they were domesticating the Scripture, admittedly for the sake of
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:12.740]   the freedom of the people, but nevertheless the cost of domesticating Scripture was far,
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:18.180]   far, far too high, and it ended up never pointing to Christ and the liberation that we have
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.260]   received from him.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.980]   We have to remember that people have done this sort of thing with Scripture many, many,
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.980]   many times.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.640]   At the time of the American Revolution, of course, there was a lot of usage of Scripture
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.500]   to justify the American Revolution.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:45.260]   It was understandable, but it is an ironic fact that those who didn't want to revolt
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.900]   but who chose instead to remain faithful to the crown—they were called United Empire
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:55.620]   loyalists who traveled north into Canada to stay there instead—they had their sermons
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.960]   and tried to justify their abandoning the American cause and escaping into Canada by
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.060]   appealing to a whole lot of Scripture again, which reminds all of us that we must be careful
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.300]   in our application of Scripture to work first and foremost within the Bible storyline to
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:18.620]   see how things come to Christ before we draw applications that sometimes are shaped much
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.660]   more by praxis than by a humble and attendant reading of the Word of God.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.660]   Amen.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.860]   That is so good.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.160]   From his home office, that was Dr. Don Carson, the co-founder and president of the Gospel
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.500]   Coalition and editor of the NIV Zondervan Study Bible, which is a study Bible version
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.740]   of what we're doing in these podcasts, which is generally called Biblical Theology.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.800]   And if you want more on how Mark uses Exodus language to explain the life and the work
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.740]   of Christ, the work of Rick Watts was mentioned here.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:55.140]   Rick wrote the notes in the Gospel of Mark in the NIV Zondervan Study Bible that I mentioned
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.260]   earlier, and those notes are really great and it's an affordable, easy way to go deeper
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:05.020]   into the fascinating theme of how the Exodus terminology from Isaiah gets worked out as
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.660]   Mark explains the life and work of Christ.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.660]   Check it out.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.860]   Well, next week is special for us because we have a pile of questions on the topic of
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.820]   transgenderism.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.660]   It is growing in political momentum in the West.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.280]   So where did it come from?
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.280]   How should we respond?
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.420]   I'll attempt to bring 10 of the best questions I have on the topic and we will talk with
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.660]   a leading pastor and theologian who is looking into the transgender movement today.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.660]   You don't want to miss it.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.140]   That's all next week on the podcast.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.980]   For now, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.020]   Have a great weekend.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.520]   [END]
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.520]   1.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   Is there a difference between a transsexual and a non-transsexual?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   2.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.520]   Is it a political decision to be transsexual?
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   3.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   Is it a political decision to be non-transsexual?
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:50.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
