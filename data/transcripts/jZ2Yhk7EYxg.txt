[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.720]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 158.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.400]   We're actually trying something new today that we're quite excited about.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.320]   This is the first time we have had the technical capability to actually record
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.600]   and film an entire episode of this podcast live, as opposed to doing
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.800]   multiple cuts and takes, recording a question, stopping, bringing another
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.720]   question, doing another question, stopping.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.200]   We're actually going to try to do this whole thing live, which includes the
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.160]   ability to actually cut to a camera that shows our intrepid producer.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.040]   Jesse, how are you doing?
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.000]   I'm doing well, thank you.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.960]   Thank you for, you know, wearing black for the black background today.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.000]   I always appreciate that.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.640]   I didn't think about what I should wear as thoroughly as I probably should have.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.200]   Well, in fairness, I sort of surprised Jesse by bringing a whole bag full of
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.000]   cables to the HQ this morning, which actually makes this possible for the first
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.320]   time.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.120]   So it turns out there's a lot involved.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.000]   The other thing we're going to be able to do today is it's a listener calls episode.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.440]   Jesse can play the calls live as if this was a live call-in show.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.360]   We don't have to put those in, in post.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.680]   So we really will be able to, in theory, roll through this whole episode.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.920]   Now, of course, just to make things particularly well-suited for our first
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.160]   live episode, I'm getting over a pretty nasty cold.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.480]   So my voice is definitely where you want to be for talking for an hour straight.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.560]   So I think we, Jesse, we really timed this one out well.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.360]   Good stuff.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.280]   I'm excited about it.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.200]   The cords are all set up and we're ready to rock here.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.080]   So one quick bit of business before we get into the calls.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.000]   Last week, I asked Jesse if we should decorate the Deep Work HQ and today he
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.480]   hasn't seen it yet, but I brought in a artificial garland that has built in
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.920]   Christmas lights that I am going to put on the desk in the main office of the HQ.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.240]   So I, I believe that counts and we can with no exaggeration now describe the
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.240]   HQ as being a winter wonderland when it comes to the level of
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.600]   decorations I've just introduced.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.560]   I'm excited about that.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.600]   We'll see it all in action soon.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.960]   All right.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   So with that out of the way, let's see what we can break.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.840]   And we're going to take our swing at doing our first live listener call show.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.600]   So let's jump into some calls.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.160]   Jesse, what is our first call about?
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.240]   All right.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.040]   So our first call, we have Nikola.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.240]   He's going to ask you a question about the Serbian scientist Tesla.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.800]   So here we go.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.400]   All right.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.520]   You regard Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla as the ultimate Deep Work thinker because
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.240]   he was 100% focused on his inventions and that led him to become the greatest
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.880]   inventor of all time.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.080]   I don't know if I would say, so it's a good question.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.200]   So if I'm hearing it correctly, the question is, do I personally consider
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.960]   Tesla Nikola Tesla to be the greater and greatest inventor of all time?
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.640]   I'm not sure if I would say that.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   I mean, it depends how we want to actually define what makes you the
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.200]   greater, greatest inventor of all time.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.600]   I recently read a pretty dense Edison biography.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.040]   And so something Edison had, for example, that Tesla didn't was the
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.520]   ability to commercialize, to take an idea, but then actually push that idea
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.920]   through into something that could be mass produced, sold at mass.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.160]   Tesla was not interested in that.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.080]   He was interested more in the technology.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.360]   There's also some mythology around Tesla.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.800]   I think the Tesla mythology has grown to the point where he's seen as basically
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.880]   inventing every technology ever in a 10 year period, like, well, Tesla thought
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.080]   about that and he thought about this.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.440]   And I think that's a little exaggerated.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.560]   All that being said, from what I know about Tesla, he was a good exemplar of deep work.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.240]   He had social phobias.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.960]   He did not like being around other people.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.280]   He could focus intensely on a problem and made some really big breakthroughs
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.880]   and particular breakthroughs about how to actually make alternating current.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.320]   Practical, how you could actually build devices to run an alternating current.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.040]   I mean, this is maybe getting a little bit in the weeds, but the advantage of
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.200]   direct current is that you can directly drive a motor and driving a motor is one
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.640]   of the most important early applications of electricity because it replaced
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.320]   steam engines and factories.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.160]   Alternating current, if you just hooked it up to a direct electromagnetic motor,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.960]   would have the motor go back and forth, back and forth.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.680]   So you actually had to invent a clever electrical apparatus that would allow
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.800]   the alternating current, current to still drive a continuous motor forward.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.760]   And there's also some other work he did on transformers, et cetera.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.880]   Anyways, great inventor, great example of someone who focused on being so good.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.640]   They couldn't be ignored.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.000]   Pushing the technology, pushing the technology.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.520]   Clearly he played a big role in Westinghouse's rise, the downfall of Edison,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.120]   the rise of AC over DC current.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.960]   So I like the question, good example of deep work.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.160]   Don't know if he is the greatest inventor of all time, but he does have a car
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.920]   named after him, so that's not so bad.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.280]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.520]   All right.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.160]   Next question.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.360]   We got Andrew.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.400]   He's got some ideas about writing for a technical audience and
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.800]   he wants your thoughts on that.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.000]   So let's fire away with Andrew here.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.960]   Hi Cal, long time listener, first time caller.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.000]   My name is Andrew and I work as a virtual CFO who also builds
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.640]   data pipelines for my clients.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.880]   I found some interesting topics when combining those two worlds
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.200]   that I'd like to write more about.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.240]   I'm specifically writing more about timeless business management
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.280]   principles and combining those with the new data rich world that we're in.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.280]   I've written for more of a general audience in the past, but I'm
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.440]   toying with the idea of writing for an academic or research journal type audience.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.840]   My background is in finance and accounting, which did not have a lot of
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.880]   writing in school, so I feel like this is a blind spot for me.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.480]   What advice do you have for a non-academic trying to write for this world?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.120]   And are there any resources you'd recommend checking out?
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.200]   Thanks Cal.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.320]   There definitely is a gap between general audience writing and academic writing.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.920]   Probably as much as anyone else in the world I know about this gap is I'm someone
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.880]   who has done quite a bit of both.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.400]   General audience writing in some sense is harder, right?
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:43.320]   Because you actually have to deploy more craft to do general audience writing well.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.080]   So the actual writing itself is harder to do.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.800]   The clarity of the ideas, the structure of the writing, the examples you give,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.360]   the narrative momentum that brings people from one idea to the other, the
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.880]   introducing a lay audience to complicated ideas without overwhelming them, giving
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.120]   them enough to latch onto so they can keep figuring out what you're trying to talk
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.320]   about, that's all hard from a craft perspective.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.360]   When it comes to technical writing for, let's say, a journal, an academic journal,
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.640]   you have to be clear, but no one really cares about the craft.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.840]   You don't have to have a lot of narrative momentum in your journal article.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.040]   You don't have to have nice illustrative examples.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.360]   You don't have to worry about redundancies.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.240]   You don't have to worry about the issue of, you know, I mentioned this thing
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.960]   earlier and it needs to pay off here and I need the end to call back the beginning.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.040]   You don't need a turn or a nut necessarily in academic writing.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.080]   It's more workmanlike.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.720]   You want to write clearly, you're conveying the information, but the real
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.480]   craft in academic writing is generating that information in the first place.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.840]   Here's the theory, here's the experiment, here's the idea.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.080]   So it's two very different worlds.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.760]   Now, I will say as an aside, I sometimes bring the craft that I have worked on in
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.800]   the world of general purpose writing to my academic papers, I will sometimes, for
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   example, as I'm known among my collaborators to do, obsess over
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.200]   introductions, wordsmith them so it flows really well and there's a storyline.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.760]   Here's the thing, none of that really helps.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.640]   I mean, I think the readers appreciate it.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.440]   I have not seen a discernible impact on whether or not my papers get accepted or
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.800]   not into academic venues if I write at a, let's say a New Yorker style
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.400]   introduction to my academic paper.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.320]   So I do it because I can't help it, but it doesn't really matter.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.120]   If you're going to do academic writing, don't wing it.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:45.840]   You have to understand for the venue that you're writing for, what is required for a
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.920]   paper to be accepted for publication?
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.560]   Who needs to be on that?
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.440]   Like, can you do this as a virtual CFO who specializes in building data pipelines
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.880]   for the journal you want to write for?
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.240]   Can you just write for them from that perspective or do you need an academic
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.800]   coauthor?
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.520]   So who needs to be on these paper?
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.680]   What is the level of original theory or ideas that needs to be in here?
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.200]   What sort of backing do you need?
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.080]   What type of literature reviewer understanding do you have to convey?
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.480]   This is a big piece of a lot of academic writing is showing a sophisticated
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.000]   understanding of the landscape.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.040]   Of existing publications and showing that you understand where your work fits
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.840]   into the landscape.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.080]   It's one of the big sins in academic writing that if a reviewer senses you don't
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.000]   know our field well, they're not going to publish your piece.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.760]   Don't guess at all this.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.600]   You really need to know the right answers because your papers will not get accepted
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.640]   if you try to wing it.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.880]   There's very specific parameters for each different particular venue that you might
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.720]   try to publish in.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.120]   So that would mean at the easiest deconstruct existing papers in the venues
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.920]   you want to publish.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.320]   Perhaps more effective, though slightly harder, is to talk with people who are
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   publishing in those venues already.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   People who are writing similar articles.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.000]   Talk to them about their work and what's required for these things to get
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.600]   accepted.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.520]   Even more effective and even more difficult would be get a coauthor who is
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.280]   experienced.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.240]   Convince someone who is already publishing multiple times in a venue.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.680]   The coauthor a paper with you.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.520]   Learn on the job what is required.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.160]   What do we need?
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.400]   What standard of evidence?
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.080]   What review?
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.360]   What is what does it really take?
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.000]   But all this comes back to the same idea.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.320]   You need information.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.040]   You need hard, realistic, on the ground information about how this type of
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.120]   publishing works before you try to do it.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.960]   And I'm going to attempt to generalize this for lots of different issues because
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.880]   I think this comes up a lot when people are thinking about new projects or
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.440]   endeavors.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.960]   It is very easy to come up with what you want to be the reality.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.880]   Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.200]   Here's what I want it to be.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.360]   I want to be a novelist and that means I'll do National Novel Writing Month
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.240]   with a proper Scrivener configuration and that will make me a novelist.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.360]   Right?
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   We want the story to be what we want it to be, but the reality might be, no,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.720]   there's a lot more training involved.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.480]   There's a lot higher bar that you have to pass.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.640]   Here's how you can tell if you're at the right level.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.880]   And so in general, I like to push that advice.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.360]   When doing something new, first do the work of figuring out about what is
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.200]   actually required to succeed.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.240]   What is actually required to succeed?
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.520]   So there's a story I told in a podcast interview recently.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.120]   It has not come out yet.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.000]   I don't usually reveal interviews I've done until after they've come out.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.880]   But I think Jesse knows who I'm talking about here.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.400]   I did a podcast interview recently with a relatively large podcaster.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.720]   You'll verify it was a pretty large podcaster.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.080]   Yes, for sure.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.920]   I'm a fan of his podcast as well.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.400]   All right.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.200]   That's all we'll say for now.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   And that's coming out in the new year at some point.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.120]   But one of the things we got into in that interview was how did I get
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.680]   started in nonfiction book writing?
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.000]   And I got into detail about the path I took because I was 20.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.800]   I was 20 years old when I got serious about writing books.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.000]   And I signed my first book deal with Random House right after I turned 21.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.880]   So we're getting into it on this podcast interview.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.240]   How did I make that work?
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:19.040]   And what I did, I think this is the biggest differentiating factor between me and the
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.360]   other sort of weird, nerdish 20 year olds who might think about writing books is I
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.240]   said, I want to get the real answer about what would be required for someone my age
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.000]   to get a book deal.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.560]   And so I used a family friend who was in journalism and said, can you connect me
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   with a literary agent?
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.480]   And you can make it clear to this agent that I'm not going to try to sell them
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:42.760]   something.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.960]   I'm not going to get her to sign me.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.200]   I just want 30 minutes information.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.480]   And so my memory is he hooked me up with a phone call with an agent.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.560]   She was a fiction agent.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.680]   So this was good.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.400]   There was no, no chance I was going to try to sell her.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.520]   She, she primarily focused on fiction, but she was very well established, knew the
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.120]   industry well.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.000]   I said, look, I'm a 20 year old.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.800]   I want to try to sign a book deal.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.040]   What would really be required?
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.840]   And she gave me the reality.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.440]   And honestly, it's probably not what you'd want to hear.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   I think what I wanted to hear was like, you're great.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.880]   Your idea is great.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.000]   Just start writing every day and you know, your book will be published.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And it's not what she told me.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.480]   It's like, look, there's going to be a huge bar for you to cross as a, someone that
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.400]   young trying to get a book deal.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:24.960]   It's a risk.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.440]   So here's the things you're going to have to do.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.680]   I think what you need to do first of all, is get more publication credits.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.400]   You have to start writing articles that are on the topic you want to sell the book
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:35.600]   on.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.960]   They're going to want to see writing samples in this genre to see that you
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.040]   really know how to write.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.760]   So you got to sell it.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.800]   Also, you're going to want to do a lot of research in advance.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.640]   They're not going to trust you to come up with the right idea.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.160]   So you need to do that all in advance.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.280]   I would do as much of the research for the book as possible in advance that you can
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.480]   give the agent followed by the publisher.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.720]   A really detailed table of contents.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.120]   Here's what I'm thinking.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.600]   So I can write on this topic.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.480]   People have paid me to write on this topic.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.960]   I've done all the research.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.080]   Here's the content.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.600]   You can see exactly what's going to be.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.720]   She said, you're probably going to have to do some pretty extensive sample chapter
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:09.960]   writing.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.040]   So I took that all to heart and it took me a while.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.440]   I went out there and got commissions.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.720]   There were small publications.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.840]   My first books were aimed at college students.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.600]   So these were student focused publications.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.240]   Some of these were online only.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:30.600]   Some of these were paper magazines that they would distribute for free on college
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.080]   campuses.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.240]   There used to be a publication called Business Today.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.000]   I'm sure if that still exists.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.520]   Came out of Princeton University students would run it, but whatever.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.480]   There's these publications.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.680]   They weren't high bar publications, but they were publications.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.800]   And I began pitching articles that were student advice oriented.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.600]   And as part of that effort, I did all of the research for my first book.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:57.320]   It was one article commission that required me to talk to a small number of Rhodes
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.960]   scholars for the article commission.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.480]   And I took that commission and interviewed 25 people.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.960]   Way more than I needed for that article, but it was all the research I needed for the
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.880]   first book I was going to pitch, How to Win a College.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.920]   So I did that work and it was a pain and it's not what I wanted the answer to be.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.360]   And it took me a year.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.480]   But then when I was done, I could get an agent like that and she could turn around
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.600]   and sell that book like that.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.800]   And we were off to the races.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.480]   If I had done what I wanted the right answer to be, which is just people will recognize
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   your brilliance when you give them a one page summary of your idea and they'll just give
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.280]   you a lot of money.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.760]   I never would have started writing.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.240]   So this is my broader interpretation here.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.880]   If you want to do something new, regardless of what it is, face the hard truth by talking
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.560]   to experts about what's really required.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.920]   It stinks in the moment because it's usually more than you want to do, but it is a huge
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.600]   competitive advantage in the long term.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   Because it means you're actually going to put your energy on the things that really
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:53.920]   matter.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.360]   While all of your potential competitors trying to get started in the same world will be doing
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.480]   National Novel Writing Month and optimizing their Scrivener configurations and they're
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.280]   never going to get there.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.440]   All right.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.320]   I think that works.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.840]   Jesse, would you be excited to read a book about virtual CFOs and rich data pipelines?
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.920]   Uh, possibly.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.960]   That was a good answer, though.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.520]   I mean, you gave Andrew a lot of content there.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.880]   Andrew's going to be happy.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.440]   I hope so.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.440]   It'd be funny if what Andrew was really wanting to write was a, like a thriller novel, but
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.520]   about virtual CFOs who through the construction of a rich data pipeline saves the world from
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.800]   a meteor strike and gets the girl in the end.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.120]   I'd be there for that book.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.840]   And he also throws like a mean fastball.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.520]   Because he plays baseball on the side.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.880]   He plays baseball on the seat.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.560]   Richard, we're giving you the secret here.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.040]   That's the book you need to write.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.560]   Forget what everyone tells you.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.680]   Just start writing, man.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.360]   10 pages a day.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.120]   Follow the muse.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:02.000]   You're going to be Dan Brown this time next year, the baseball throwing virtual CFO who's
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.360]   rich data pipelining.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.880]   He's been using just to attract women, but decides to put his skill to use and takes
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.360]   a break from his pitching responsibility slash data pipeline responsibilities to save the
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.560]   earth from meteor.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.440]   I love it, man.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.000]   You're set.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.720]   All right.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.440]   What do we got next?
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.960]   All right.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.680]   Our next question.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:26.320]   We got a question about the deep work buckets and then Keystone habits.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.520]   So let's take a listen.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.920]   Hi, Cal.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.880]   It's an effect here.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.120]   I'm wondering if you could explain the difference between.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:48.480]   Deep work and the roles that you play and your buckets.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:55.840]   And your Keystone habits in those, I'm assuming you have other things you do in the buckets.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:03.760]   And I'm just not clear how you see the relationship between the buckets and your roles.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.680]   And I suppose deep work.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.440]   Thanks.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.040]   All right.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:15.360]   This is a good question because we can clarify the relationship between the deep life.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.760]   The philosophy that includes the buckets and deep work, which is a type of professional
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.560]   activity.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.320]   Jesse, let me ask you the right off the bat.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.920]   I sort of stumbled into this terminology of buckets early in the pandemic when I was.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.680]   Thinking through the deep life and now we're kind of stuck with them.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.200]   You think this is a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.080]   You've talked about the buckets for a while because I've been listening to your podcast
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.880]   since the very beginning.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.800]   I like the terminology and I remember you mentioning it even before I.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.560]   Started working with you, but I've always been a fan of the buckets.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.440]   I use it when I explain it to certain people, so I think it's fine.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.800]   But yeah, all right.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.000]   So we got what it is.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.560]   Buckets.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.520]   We're stuck with buckets.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.040]   Let me do, by the way, let me do an update on the book and then I'll get to this answer.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:08.800]   But I just finished my sixth version of the potential outline for this book.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.480]   I've gone through six versions.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.760]   Had a hard time with it.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.280]   I did the first version that I actually sent off to my literary agent and said, OK, I
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.480]   think I think I have this thing cracked.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.400]   I think I might be ready to write a proposal.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.560]   Jesse, let me do an update.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.800]   Let me give you the latest update on the potential book I will be writing about the deep life
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.840]   and then we'll get to the meat.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.040]   We'll get the meat of this question.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.640]   Yeah, let's do it.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.280]   So here's what was struggling with me before.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.200]   I was struggling before when I was thinking about this book because it was important to
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.560]   me that for this subject matter that the book was, for lack of a better word, smart.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.760]   I didn't want to tackle something as.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.520]   Philosophically resonant as living a deep life.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.960]   I didn't want to tackle it with.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.640]   And now here's the seven steps and here's bullet points and here's.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.760]   Lazy writing, which in the nonfiction space, the pragmatic nonfiction space, you know,
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.560]   you get lazy writing when a lot of rhetorical questions enter the scene.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.920]   That's a little tip when you get a lot of.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.000]   But would this really work?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.160]   What about a what about a buzz like, man, that's your notes for like what you need to
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.200]   craft good writing about.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.280]   You can't just put the rhetorical questions into the writing.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.440]   So I thought this topic really needed it to be smart.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.160]   I mean, it's a complicated topic, but my issue was.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.280]   When all I was doing was trying to come up with a table of contents for the book.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.680]   I was putting all of the necessity to make the book smart onto the table of contents.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.520]   And so it was leading me down these unusual and contrived structures for the book, because
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.840]   it's like, well, I want the structure itself to convey that this is something different.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.680]   And eventually what I realized was, no, keep the structure simple.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.920]   And let the writing do the work.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:03.680]   And in fact, not only make it simple, why don't we just still down to its essence, like
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.720]   the very elements of a Cal Newport book and simplify them down to its purest form.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.160]   So the structure is there and it's there, but in a minimalist form, and then let your
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.120]   writing do all the work of showing the philosophical depth of this topic.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:25.360]   And so that's what I ended up doing with my current outline in the prologue.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.960]   Right up there in the prologue, it's me, it's early pandemic.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.600]   This topic arise, I coined the term buckets.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.360]   And I just let this one short prologue is going to do all the work of just motivating
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.480]   why this topic matters.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.520]   It's been around forever.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.400]   Each whatever, each generation comes at it differently.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.440]   We have our own moment where we're kind of re-appraising this topic, but no, like multiple
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.040]   chapters with citing 70 things, a prologue that is just grounded in a place and a time
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.880]   and me, boom.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.120]   Right?
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.240]   Then we go to a next chapter, prepare.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:02.880]   All of the stuff we've talked about, I mean, the buckets, in general, what makes a deep
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.360]   life deep?
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   I mean, I've pretty much simplified it in my own thinking that the definition of a deep
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:15.040]   life is you radically align, radically aligning your life to be in alignment with things that
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:15.760]   you really value.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.840]   So it's about not just aligning elements of your life, but being willing to make radical
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   changes to your life to align it to things that you value.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.640]   I think just let's just give the definition.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.640]   Let's talk about it.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.000]   Like, what's the hard thing about it?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.520]   Well, it's hard to figure out what changes to make.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.160]   We have this bucket system we'll talk about in a second that can help, but like, there
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.120]   it is just one chapter, call it prepare out of the way.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.640]   Not dragging this out, not going whatever, just boom.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   And then the whole rest of the book, I have five chapters.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:49.040]   Each is a different element of something you might radically align as part of building
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:55.600]   a deep life, naming them with one word verbs and let the writing do the work.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.080]   So you have this prologue, you have this prepare chapter, and then it's right now, the
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:07.520]   terminology I have is move, quit, serve, train, wonder.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.240]   It's the current list and the list might change, but one word, one verb, like I'm trying to
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.120]   get down to the essence.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.120]   Like, let's get down to the essence of a Cal Newport book.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.160]   Here's the problem.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.440]   Here's the solution.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.000]   Let's look into how you implement the solution.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.040]   Just getting it down to the essence.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.680]   And then I can let the writing do the work.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   I'm going to follow my own journey through these chapters.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.120]   I'm a character in this.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.400]   They're going to be asymmetrical.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.320]   So it's not like every chapter has the same structure as every other one.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.120]   I really want to get away from opening story, interpretation of the opening story, complicating
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.400]   story, four bullet points.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.200]   It's going to be some chapters be different than others.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.800]   I'm a character in it.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.600]   Let's be nuanced in tackling these issues.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.240]   Take these different elements of building a deep life and really go try to understand
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.120]   why do they resonate?
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.240]   What's at the core of them?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.560]   What do you have to think about if you're trying to do an alignment here?
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.120]   Give some respect to the reader to help put the pieces together.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.240]   So that's where I am now.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.920]   Very simple structure.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.200]   Now it then ends with an epilogue.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.560]   Okay, here's how I've changed my own life.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.000]   Very simple structure.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.200]   One word chapter titles.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.760]   Get down to the core of it.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.640]   And then we'll really let a journey unfold.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.560]   Let the writing do what the writing needs to do.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:18.960]   I don't know.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.000]   So what do you think, Jesse?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.600]   Better or worse than where I was before?
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   I like it.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.720]   So I have a question.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.840]   When you were doing, when you were trying to make the book seem smart and you were
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:37.760]   developing the table of contents, how did you explain that to the agent or whoever you
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.120]   submitted it to that it was the writing that was going to be the smart work?
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.280]   Or did you write the epilogue as well so they had an example?
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.000]   You know, so yeah, it's a good question.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.080]   So like what I was doing before is I was getting too cute with the structure.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.760]   Well, I think the last time I talked about on the podcast, maybe at that point I was
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.680]   doing paths like here are the four main paths that people follow.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.240]   And that wasn't quite right.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.160]   I want to get to the crux of the matter.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.680]   Like what are the actual changes that create the depth, the resonance?
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.200]   I want to be more concrete.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.640]   So that seemed too complicated.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.440]   And then I had a form where each chapter was a setting.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.080]   So it was like, I'm at this farm.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.920]   I'm at this like writer's retreat or something like this.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.280]   And then I would build out from the setting.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   But I was like, this is again, it's not clear to the reader.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.360]   Why are we at this setting?
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.200]   And I don't want this to be just one of these reflection books where I just like I have
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.920]   these kind of reflections and I prove that I'm smart with my writing.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.320]   And that seemed too cute.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:44.160]   And so really, and then I had more complicated traditional structures where, you know, here's
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.200]   like three, four chapters on like what's needed to prepare, you know, for the deep life.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.040]   And it was like spending all this time on it.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.480]   Like that felt forced or whatever.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.200]   So I just simplified it down to these one word chapters.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.680]   And I sent it off just for my agent to look at.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.640]   But I was like, the structure should make a lot of sense here.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.280]   It's my standard.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.160]   I've just simplified it.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   But the writing is going to do what the writing does.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.120]   It's going to follow my story.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.560]   Not every chapter is going to be the same.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.360]   And it was more for me.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.480]   I just felt a clarity.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   And I felt like a book like this needed a lot of clarity.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.880]   Just you look at the table of contents, like I know what you're up to.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.520]   Let's get into it.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.880]   If that makes sense.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.080]   Got it.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.480]   So this being the sixth version, how long is that process?
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.360]   Like six months?
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.600]   Like you submit a version every month or is it?
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.560]   So this is the first version I submitted.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.920]   So it's like the first five versions, I was like, no.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:40.320]   So my whole thing, my whole process is I rely heavily on my sense of taste.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:46.000]   To borrow the terminology from Ira Glass, that like the first step in trying to produce
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.160]   something good is you have to develop the taste to recognize good things.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.160]   And it can be frustrating because then you know when you're doing stuff that's not hitting that.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.440]   That's not hitting that level.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.320]   So I know what I'm looking for.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   And I'm very empathetic.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:07.040]   So I can, I put myself into the head of a potential reader and try to simulate what's
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.240]   that response?
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.640]   Is there an aspirational response or not?
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:10.880]   Right.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.000]   So I'm very empathetic.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.680]   I'm like this in person, by the way, too.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.720]   I very strongly read and feel empathetically what's going on in a room.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.320]   If I'm talking to someone, like every little nuance about their state of mind and how they're
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   feeling, it hits me really big.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.560]   Right.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.040]   And this has negatives and positives.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.560]   It has some social implications that aren't great, but it's good for writing because I can.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.400]   I can simulate the mind of the reader really well.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.280]   And so I really began working on this in earnest in July, just trying to get an outline.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.840]   And for the other five, I would finish it.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.240]   I would sit with it and it was just a feeling.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.680]   It's not right.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.360]   It's hard to explain.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.040]   It's like a little premonition of like something's not right here.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.960]   There's some grit in the gears and I would sit on it and I just say, this is not right.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.000]   And then I would try again.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.320]   And I think it's not quite right.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.120]   And I would try again.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.000]   But it's not quite right.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.080]   So it's really for me, it's all this intuition.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.800]   I just have an intuition when I finally feel like I think I'm honing in on.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.640]   I think I'm honing in on something that the reader's it's going to get.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:10.960]   It's good.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.280]   It's all about pressing the buttons I want to press.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.760]   I want the experience of reading the book to be exciting.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.040]   Like you have the sense of I'm going to change something in my life and I'm getting some
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.760]   revelation and there's a whole sense that I'm going for.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.520]   And so I've been sitting with this one for a while and feel better about it.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.640]   So I think I'm getting closer.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:35.600]   Did you influence at all by your friend Ryan Holiday's new books with the one chapter titles
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.120]   that he's been doing?
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.800]   Did that influence at all with the one chapter?
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.200]   Yeah, yes.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.600]   So Ryan, I think Ryan is a great example of this of keeping the form, keeping the form
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:57.040]   simple and clear and then letting the writing do the work of actually affecting the person.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.400]   Yeah, I think he's a great example of that.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:05.120]   If we're going to be really highfaluting about this and self-important, as you know, I went
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.120]   through this phase of reading a lot about film, film studies, et cetera.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.880]   Technically, you could think about what I'm interested in is the pragmatic nonfiction
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.520]   equivalent of auteur theory in film.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.560]   So in film, when you look at Fellini and auteur theory, there is this sense of like what the,
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.760]   especially in the 70s and 80s, that these auteur directors would take a well-established genre
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:33.120]   and then they would work within the constraints of that genre to create art.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.880]   And it was actually in the tension of their work against the constraints that you would
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.640]   subvert this or what they would do with this, that you would actually create the value that
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.640]   somehow that there was something to this that was even more special or magical than just
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.080]   starting with a blank slate.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   So this would be the difference between Ford working within the constraints of the Western
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.800]   and visually and storytelling-wise working with it or Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven, which
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:05.520]   I recently re-watched, taking the constraints of the genre that he helped define earlier
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.800]   in his career and is in the subverting of the constraints that actually the power comes
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.440]   out.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.600]   And then comparing that, for example, to Terry Malick, who was just like, "I'm going to
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.800]   construct this thing from scratch.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.080]   This movie is going to be whatever it's going to be."
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.400]   The auteur theory, you work within the genre.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.320]   I think it's an incredibly self-important way of describing how-to books that I write.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.560]   But at least it gives me some sort of motivation.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.040]   And Ryan does this too, work within the constraints of the genre.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.320]   So I have a very clear constraint, motivation, idea.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.960]   All right, so here's this issue.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.040]   Here's my original idea about what to do about it.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.600]   Digital minimalism, deep work, replacing the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.640]   Then a journey to understand how to implement it.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:02.320]   Which is where you help the reader instantiate in their own mind how their life might actually
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.760]   change to act on that promise.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.120]   That's my Western movie or detective novel.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.040]   And I'm trying to work within it.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.400]   So that's what I'm doing with this new one.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.720]   Let's just distill it down to one word, incredibly simple.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.040]   Get the motivation to a prologue.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.280]   Get the whole, here's the idea down to just one chapter.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.760]   Use all the new muscles I've been building at The New Yorker to be clear and well-crafted
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.360]   and balanced and momentum going.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.280]   And then just see where it goes.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.560]   So this is like the self-important stuff I tell myself.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.480]   So I don't get bored.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.560]   I don't know, would you buy this?
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.240]   It might, this is probably going too far, right?
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.680]   Talking about auteur theory.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.800]   No, I like it a lot.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.960]   In fact, if it becomes a movie, we can get Andrew from the previous call to be a character.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.960]   And it's got all those other traits.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.320]   Yeah, I left that.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.200]   I did leave that out.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.080]   That's going to be a big part of the book is going to be these big call-out boxes.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:56.400]   And I'm going to have a sketch of Andrew, a really dramatic sketch of Andrew, and a lot
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.640]   of details on rich data pipelines.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.560]   Because you've got to subvert expectations.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.400]   You're like, oh man, what's going to happen?
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.680]   This guy's going to quit his job.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.760]   And then it's XML formats for maximum data portability.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.600]   That's, I think that's where the magic is going to be.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.800]   I love the explanation.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.520]   I think it was great.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.000]   There's an actual question lurking in there, wasn't there?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.360]   Yeah, so the question was about deep work and working with the keystone habits.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.040]   You get this type of question a decent amount.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.440]   But I always love hearing the explanation because I'm a big firm believer that people
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.280]   need to be continually coached.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.000]   So yeah.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.640]   OK, so yeah.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.960]   Now let's get back to the meat of it.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.480]   All right, so we have the deep life.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.440]   We have this growing definition of the deep life that I've been refining, where it's really
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.120]   about living your life in radical alignment with things you value.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   So you're aligning the things you value.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.360]   You're willing to make radical changes to actually make that alignment, maybe radical
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.680]   changes to where you live and work or the structure of your day.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:58.320]   Implicit in this definition is also you're comfortable missing out on other things to
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.200]   do this priority.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.120]   So I'm going to really focus on a few things that really matter and radically align my
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.320]   life with it.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.320]   All right, so that's my vision of the deep life.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.560]   The hard part about the deep life, and this is something I've been refining when I've
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.160]   been thinking about this potential book.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.400]   The hard part is, well, figuring out what that is, like what's really important.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.760]   How do you align your life to it?
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.680]   There's some preparation that's actually required to get better in tune with yourself
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.640]   and to get more comfortable with the idea that you have efficacy, that you can actually
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.560]   influence the way your life unfolds.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.640]   A lot of us aren't really used to that, except for in very minor ways, like trying a new
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.520]   exercise routine.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:40.560]   And so the bucket, the bucket system I talk about on the podcast a lot is in some sense
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:46.400]   a way of doing that preparation, beginning to learn what's important to you, beginning
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.920]   to build that muscle of aligning your life with the things that are important, even if
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.640]   that requires sacrifices or deemphasizing other things.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   It's the preparation stage.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.120]   And then once you're done with that preparation stage, then you might actually make some more
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:01.920]   radical steps.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:08.080]   Now I'm ready to like with confidence move across the country, go to the farm, radically
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.320]   change our work situation, whatever it's going to be.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:17.600]   So I see now the buckets as a preparatory step towards a more extreme push towards a
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.100]   deep life.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:23.760]   The idea briefly is you identify the important areas of your life.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.520]   I call these the deep life buckets.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.080]   The examples I give often are alliterative, and I'll start with C.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.800]   So the original group I used to talk about was craft, community, constitution, and
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.720]   contemplation, but people have different lists of what's important to them.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:45.760]   And what I would recommend in this system is that you start, step one, identifying a
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.720]   keystone habit for each of these buckets, something you do on a daily basis and track
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.880]   that you actually did it that's not trivial, but is also tractable.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:01.120]   So it's not, you know, I clap my hands twice, but it's also not I ran a half marathon
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:01.620]   every day.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.520]   These keystone habits should be something that advances something you care about in
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.080]   that bucket.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.480]   The idea here is not that this will radically transform your life, but that you begin to
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.800]   get used to this idea of I intentionally prioritize each of these things.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.560]   Each of these things gets attention.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.360]   So that's step one.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:28.560]   Step two, then I recommend taking each of these buckets in turn and giving it four,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.680]   six, maybe eight weeks.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.440]   So I usually say average out four to six weeks where you focus just on that area of your
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.680]   life and overhaul it.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.720]   Like what more permanent changes do I want to make?
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.840]   What things do I want to eliminate?
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.040]   What new things do I want to do?
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.200]   What more permanent changes do I want to make to make sure that that part of my life is
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.160]   getting a good amount of attention and I'm extracting from it a good amount of value
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.040]   in my day-to-day life?
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.800]   That takes some time and experimentation.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.280]   So that's why I say take at least four to six weeks for each.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:02.560]   This is a concept that I stole from the medieval Jewish practice of Musar, M-U-S-S-A-R, which
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.760]   is a practice of virtue cultivation where you actually focus one month at a time on
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.800]   different virtues that you're trying to improve and then you cycle back again.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.880]   Very into that idea.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.520]   I think it's a really cool idea that should be known more widely.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.960]   So I'm sort of pulling from there.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:24.400]   And then when you're done with those overhauls, you are going to be in a state now where you
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.480]   know what's important to you because you have been experimenting with it and trying to amplify
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.920]   things and just getting in touch with those intimations for each of the areas of your
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.080]   life.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.720]   You've just spent a month thinking nothing about that.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:40.800]   And you feel a lot more efficacious because you've now done non-trivial rewiring of elements
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.200]   of your life to make sure that each of these buckets is being satisfied.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.600]   That by itself is going to put you on a much more stable foundation.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.360]   If you did nothing else, I think your life is going to be deeper.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.520]   It also puts you into the right place if you want to make the radical changes.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.480]   Because now you really know what you're all about and you're confident you can make changes.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.400]   So that's the deep life bucket system.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:09.040]   Deep work, by contrast, is a particular type of professional effort.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.360]   It is when you're working on something that is cognitively demanding and you don't context
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:13.840]   switch.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.960]   So you give it your full attention.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.560]   Much more minor in the grand scheme of things.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.400]   So where might that show up in here?
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.760]   Well, what I call the craft bucket is the bucket that's dedicated to what you produce
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.560]   professionally.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.920]   It also, by the way, can cover other things you produce that maybe is not at the core
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.480]   of your job.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.280]   But any type of producing of things that are valuable.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:39.840]   If you're the actor Nick Offerman, for example, from Parks and Recreation, he has this fantastic
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:46.240]   woodshed warehouse in the suburb of Los Angeles somewhere where he builds these great wood
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.280]   creations.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.720]   Yeah, it's not a business for him, but it's craft and that's important to him.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.520]   So it's building things, but definitely a professional life is covered there.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.240]   When you're considering craft, deep work matters.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.080]   Because as we talk about, you want to produce things of value.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.360]   That means you want to make sure that you have good time protected for deep work.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:09.760]   And you want to work on the load of work in your life, probably so that you have enough
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.880]   ratio of deep to shallow work.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   Yeah, that's all considerations that apply narrowly when you're trying to figure out
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.760]   your craft bucket.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.600]   So to get to the definitive answer to the original question, the deep life is this big
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.080]   idea.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:28.320]   If you're going through my preparatory deep life bucket system during the time you're
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.240]   focused on a craft or whatever your equivalent is of the craft bucket, that's real care
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:34.960]   about deep work.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:42.720]   And I like to make this point because I think deep work as a concept has inflated for some
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.160]   people to cover a lot of things.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.680]   And I'm trying to keep these separations more clear.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.200]   So this is why I like to talk about, let's get deep work narrow to what it is, focusing
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.480]   on something hard without distraction.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.120]   And let's use the term deep life to capture this broader goal of living a life that's
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.600]   radically aligned with your values.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.840]   All right, so I don't know.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:09.280]   Do you think-- I think, Jesse, that's probably the-- I'm breaking records here for length
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:14.640]   of answers before we actually get to any information relevant to the original question.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.480]   That was a good one.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.200]   That one was 21 minutes, probably?
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:19.760]   Pretty close.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.320]   Oh, dear Lord.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:20.800]   We're rolling.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.360]   It was solid.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:21.920]   All right.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.320]   All right.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.360]   You know, I'm going fast.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.640]   I'm going fast.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.280]   This is my challenge.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.400]   Fast answer on this next one.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.040]   Be ready for it.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.600]   All right, so here we go.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:40.480]   The next question we have, a question about your dislike of the words content and content
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.440]   creator.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.400]   She explains more.
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.360]   Hi, Cal.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.160]   My name is Tina, and I'm in academic medicine.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:56.480]   You've mentioned on the show several times about how you hate the word content and content
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:56.960]   creator.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:02.640]   I find that I don't like these terms either, but I can't quite articulate why.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:09.760]   Can you explain further as to why these words just don't sound right, considering your deep
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.360]   life and deep work philosophies?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.960]   Thank you very much.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.080]   I'm a huge fan of the show.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.320]   All right.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   I'll be quick on this answer.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:25.600]   I think the content and content creator terminology, the context in which it is often used,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:33.120]   is in a very sterile business technique optimization type context, right?
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.720]   So when you hear content creator, you're imagining that you're going to be watching a YouTube
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:44.160]   video about optimizing your subscription numbers for your YouTube channel or something like
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.320]   this.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.560]   When you think of content or content creator, you think of people saying, "I want you to
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.840]   smash that subscribe button and hit the bell."
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:41:00.000]   And so it's sterile and business focused, where I tend to focus more on the craft itself,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.400]   the Steve Martin advice of be so good they can't ignore you, that you're not a content
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.960]   creator who's trying to meet a content schedule.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:16.160]   You're trying to instead craft a book that hundreds of thousands of people are going
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.280]   to feel like changed their life.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.880]   You're not trying to optimize readership numbers.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.960]   You're trying to write an article that is going to change the way a whole segment of
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.120]   the population understands an important issue.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.320]   So I like to put the focus concretely on the actual artistic thing you're trying to create
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:38.160]   and put as much energy as possible into making that as good as possible.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.600]   And then all the other stuff, it comes along, but it's kind of on the side.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.000]   I don't know.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.400]   I mean, yeah, there's some stuff you have to do, but that's not the focus.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.960]   The focus is producing the good stuff.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.880]   Now, Jesse, you've been teaching me about some of this stuff, right?
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.280]   So you're helping me get videos online.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:04.160]   You will admit to the audience that I know very little about YouTube or videos, and I
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.120]   practice what I preach.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.440]   I do not know any content creator information.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.860]   I'm not.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.480]   I'm okay with YouTube and stuff.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:17.600]   I have a channel on another field that's decent.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.920]   But all in all, yeah, I mean, I can attest to that.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.680]   See, I guess that--
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.360]   Okay, one other-- I don't wanna go long, because I promised to be short, so I'll be short here.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:35.040]   But I think there's also a "there but for the grace of God go I" type fear I have, which
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.800]   is there's a very specific job in the world of people who work in written or visual mediums,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.680]   which is being a YouTube personality.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.480]   And they are really beholden to these algorithms.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:57.280]   I guess if you make money off of YouTube advertisements, it really matters if your videos get recommended,
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.440]   right?
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.200]   I guess that's where a lot of views come from.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.280]   And there's all of these little things that matter for the algorithm to get your video
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.080]   shown more.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.720]   And obsessing about these things really probably makes a very practical difference to how much
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.600]   money you make.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:18.400]   And so to me, when I see my son watching Minecraft YouTubers, I'm like, "What?
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.200]   What a hard job.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.520]   Man, this is a smart guy.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.600]   I'm wondering if he should go to med school."
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.160]   [laughs]
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.400]   I mean, because they have to do this all day long and get subscribers and this and this
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:28.640]   bell.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.320]   I don't know what the bell does, but if they don't do this, it's not gonna get recommended.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.040]   If it doesn't get recommended, they're not gonna be able to pay their heating bill,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.120]   and they have to render videos all night long.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.360]   And I don't wanna do any of that.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.840]   So for me, I'm also, I think, just in a self-protective way.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.840]   I say, "I don't want anything to do with that world."
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.160]   I care about my books.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:52.480]   Like when it comes to metrics of success, how many copies my books sell and podcast
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:52.800]   listeners.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.200]   I think downloads of the podcast is very important.
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.240]   I like this medium.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:56.880]   It's distributed.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.600]   We control it.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.400]   I think it's given us a great relationship with the audience.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.120]   And if YouTube videos help those things, that's great.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:09.200]   But I really, I think once you go down that line of trying to serve the YouTube algorithm,
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.640]   it's a Faustian bargain.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.000]   - 100%.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.600]   I think the gamers, they have a tough lifestyle.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.360]   I mean, they probably don't have the best diet in the world.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.720]   They're probably not exercising that much.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.400]   Their backs probably hurt all the time.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.160]   But some of them make bank.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.320]   So I mean, as long as they're not blowing all the money, maybe they're okay.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:28.960]   But who knows?
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.480]   I mean, I completely agree with you though.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.680]   - Here's my counterfactual though.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:38.640]   Let's say we take, let's say everyone who in the last five years made a serious run,
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.280]   and let's just focus on one game at a Minecraft YouTube video, right?
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.920]   Like where they're doing it almost full-time.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.880]   Now, if we took all those people and said almost anything else, like try writing books,
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:56.320]   try starting a software company, like just get your college degree and try to go into banking,
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.000]   I bet we'd have the same income distribution.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.080]   There'd be like a small number of people who made a lot of money.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.840]   And like some other people, most other people,
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.160]   actually would probably be a better distribution.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.440]   You'd have a few people that made a lot of money, but a lot of money would be more
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.200]   than the best YouTubers make.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.480]   And then almost everyone else would have at least a stable middle-class lifestyle,
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.520]   where with the YouTubers, probably the curve is much more brutal,
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.800]   that like 80% can't even pay their bills with it.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.400]   But it would be the time demands of, I don't know, I ran a software company
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.200]   or a banker would probably be better than the work.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.400]   I guess my counterfactual is like, is this actually opening up?
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.080]   Because I don't think it's a better lifestyle.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.600]   It's a really hard job.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:36.480]   Is it really opening up like more income-making opportunities?
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.120]   Then these are smart kids than other stuff they could do.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.000]   That's probably more rational thinking than they went into.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.800]   They probably first started doing it and then realized they might be able to make some money
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.280]   with it.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.640]   And then all of a sudden, it was like a snowball effect.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.000]   So like people were doing it.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.800]   And there's a tension.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.560]   And I don't think that they would ever even want to begin,
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.240]   you know, starting an accounting firm or doing some sort of thing like that,
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.720]   where they have to report to work and do whatever.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.840]   Yeah, but you could be, they're all tech savvy.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:14.480]   They could, most of these guys, I bet could build up pretty good computer programming skills
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:20.400]   and work, I don't know, half the year on contract.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.680]   And have the other half the year completely free and probably have as,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.800]   maybe it's just not as much fun.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.920]   Maybe I'm not a romantic.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.720]   Some of them might be.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.840]   I think a lot of them might be.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.800]   Like my good buddy who has like an online business plays games all the time.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.480]   He doesn't do videos, but yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.720]   Well, this is just me justifying myself, but okay.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.200]   Good question.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.480]   That's semi-fast.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.280]   That's semi-fast.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.880]   Do we have another one?
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.680]   How are we doing with time?
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.680]   Yeah, we have one more question.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.280]   This is a question about studying for the GMAT.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.320]   And then at the tail end, she's also juggling job hunting.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.720]   So we'll take a listen to what Lindsay has to say.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.040]   All right.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.120]   Hi, Cal.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.160]   This is Lindsay.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.040]   I'm a huge fan of your work.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.840]   I am wondering if you could speak to two things.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:18.080]   The first is most effective way to study for the GMAT test.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:24.000]   I took it back in 2011.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:31.760]   I have to retake it now that I'm applying to school again for something else.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:40.880]   And because they have changed the test and there's so many guides and books in online
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:46.240]   courses out there that I do not, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:54.000]   So if you could speak to that or like generally standardized, like higher education.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.320]   Just a quick pause here right there.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:56.880]   Secondly,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.760]   so let me answer her first part and then we'll get her second part if that works,
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.440]   because GMAT, I have a simple answer for any of those standardized tests.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:13.680]   Doing sample test under the real time conditions is by far the actual best practice.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.480]   I can do real sample test and get this score under those conditions.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.400]   Then you will get that score in the real test.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.840]   If you can't, you won't.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.800]   The only thing you do is use books.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.560]   I don't think you need the online courses.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   Get books to learn the techniques they recommend for each of the different types of sections.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.240]   So, okay, I'm going to study these type of questions and look at the techniques.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.000]   Now I'm going to try it under time conditions.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.560]   Then I'll go back and deconstruct the answers I got wrong,
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.920]   figure out how to answer them right.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.000]   See if I'm missing any techniques.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.960]   Why did I get that wrong?
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.800]   Was it a mistake or I didn't know how to do it and then do it again under time conditions.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.360]   And that's it.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:55.120]   I mean, this is how I did, for example, the GRE when I was applying to graduate school
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:59.520]   in computer science, most of these schools cared only about your math section.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.640]   I knew you needed a high 700s in the math to be in contention for any of these schools.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.520]   They preferred 800, but I gamed it out and was like, okay, high 700s would be enough.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   And that's all I did.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.680]   Like, okay, let me read a book about the different types of questions and the techniques they
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.840]   recommend, sample test, how'd I do?
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.680]   Try again, try again.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.240]   Okay, I'm in the high 700s, go took the test and we're done.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.680]   So that's the way to prepare.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.880]   Nothing else fancy, get in real conditions, do the test, figure out what you got wrong.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.040]   Look at one book on techniques, but it's really, it's really a game of practicing.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.280]   All right, let's see what your second part of the question is.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:47.440]   - Job hunting, organization, best way to practice answers, things like that,
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.200]   interviews.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:55.520]   So I'm kind of doing both at the same time.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.920]   Thank you so much.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.480]   Okay, bye.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:07.200]   - All right, well, first of all, tangentially, Jesse, was that the first call we've had where
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.640]   someone seems to actually be walking?
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.520]   - There seemed to be a lot of talk in the background.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.560]   - I heard footsteps.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:19.040]   Yeah, so I don't, can the technology we use for people to call in, I guess that must work
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:19.840]   on your phone, right?
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.280]   - I think so.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.440]   - Okay, so now we know, now we know.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.040]   We've never heard someone actually walking.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:31.120]   I think it'd be funny if the reality was Lindsey had a really large media cart and like on
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.760]   the media cart, she had a desktop computer with a monitor and like a keyboard.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.880]   And then there was another wagon that had a generator in it.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.320]   And there was like someone pulling the cart and someone pushing the generator.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.520]   And she had like a headset on connected to the computer as she walked,
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.680]   trying to answer the question.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:51.840]   It's either that or SpeakPipe works on your phone.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.120]   We'll see, but anyways, that's cool.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.760]   So, all right, everyone, now we know you can answer these questions from the phone.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.000]   And if you want to know how to do this, by the way, calnewport.com/podcast, there's a
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.320]   link, but it's just a service called SpeakPipe and you like record right from your web browser.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:11.680]   Okay, so for job interviews, so for corporate job interviews, if you're going to be doing
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.880]   corporate recruiting in particular, you got to practice that too.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:20.880]   And the way you practice that is it has to be practice specific to those types of interviews.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:27.360]   Just to give you a little insight or look, if you're at an elite college, for example,
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:35.760]   and watching people interviewing for banking jobs or consulting jobs, there's practice
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.600]   sessions that they do again and again with sample types of questions.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.120]   How do you answer case questions?
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.800]   How do you answer brainstorming questions?
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:47.520]   Coders, so let's say you're trying to get a job as a computer programmer at Google,
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.840]   tell you just based on our grad students here at Georgetown, they practice a lot.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:56.480]   And there's various tools like LeetCode, I think it's called, where you can practice
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.000]   the types of coding puzzles that they will give you to do on the whiteboards.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.080]   But it's a very specific skill.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.760]   You have to think about corporate recruiting, like you're going to juggle.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.360]   I got to practice how to do this.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:13.760]   Quick personal story, when I was at Dartmouth, I signed up for one of these interviews for
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.640]   a consulting firm.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.440]   They were doing the first pass on campus.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.600]   And I was like, I don't need to practice.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.440]   I'm a smart guy, a four-O's.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:25.040]   And just got destroyed because it was so specific.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.280]   I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.240]   Because I did not practice.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.160]   They're like, all right, well, I forgot the question was.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.680]   It was something like, help us walk you through how you think through this question.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.040]   Like how many windows?
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.680]   I think the question was like, how many windows are there in Manhattan?
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.320]   Now to me, I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:40.880]   I don't know.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:44.640]   But it turns out, oh, that's a very specific type of question that corporate recruiters
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:44.880]   ask.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.640]   And there's a method for how you practice it.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.320]   And I hadn't practiced it.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:48.640]   Right.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.800]   And so that interview went disastrously.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:56.000]   So that's all I want to say is that these type of jobs, especially for elite companies,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.040]   people practice a lot, specifically a type of interview questions they're going to do.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.440]   So that is worth finding a course for.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.040]   There's online training tools for different types of interviews.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.840]   There's online courses for doing different types of interviews.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.200]   It is highly specific.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.640]   So you do want to practice that.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.120]   So get that practice in.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.120]   And it's just like with the GMAT.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.320]   Once you know, I've done 100 of these type of questions.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.520]   I know how to do these questions.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.920]   I know how to figure out the number of windows in Manhattan.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.880]   I know how to come up with a binary search algorithm on the whiteboard that, you know,
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.040]   uses a single array pointer, whatever the challenge is.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.720]   Like I've done it 100 times.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.000]   Then you'll be confident.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.280]   You'll be confident for the interview.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.120]   All right, Jesse, I think we made it.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:43.440]   I think we made it through a whole episode live of questions.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.360]   And the tech seems to be holding up.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.760]   So, I mean, I think the only thing we're missing now is we have to figure out,
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.680]   do you think actual live calls might be possible one day?
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.400]   If people have generators and, you know, wheelbarrows that they can, you know, take over.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.360]   They can move their cars.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.200]   We will demand that.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.440]   We will demand that you are in the wilderness on a generator with a media cart.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.640]   That's the only thing that stands in our way.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.680]   Actually, I see why not.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.680]   I mean, they could zoom into your computer or something like that.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.160]   And because your computer is hooked up to our mixing board now.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.360]   So, all right, stay tuned, everyone.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.200]   But the technology is advancing.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   This was a big step.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:26.640]   We'll put the full video of this online as soon as that YouTube stuff gets rolling.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.400]   So you can actually see a full episode video if you're curious what it looks like in here.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.920]   But until then, I believe that's a full episode, Jesse.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:42.160]   So let's call this a wrap.
