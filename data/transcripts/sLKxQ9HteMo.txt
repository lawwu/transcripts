[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Here's an email question from Abby in Millersville, Maryland.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.320]   "Pastor John, in the past few years I've heard from several former Protestant friends,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.840]   20-somethings from a variety of evangelical denominations, that they are joining the Catholic
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.920]   Church.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.400]   Some of these friends are saying that they place a higher value on tradition than on
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   Scripture.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.720]   They are people with whom I spent years ministering and studying Scripture.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.200]   What's going on here, are these just non-believers who are being weeded from the fold?"
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.080]   What do you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.200]   The road to Rome is not a new phenomenon.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.480]   It was happening when I was in college.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.280]   It's always been happening ever since there was a church.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.280]   People have left and people have returned to the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.800]   And I suspect it will always be as long as both kinds of churches exist.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.480]   It would be way too rash to say that everyone who makes the trek from Protestantism to Roman
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.680]   Catholicism are unbelievers who are being weeded out of the fold.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:21.000]   They're just too many different kinds of reasons and the stories are never over in this life.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.640]   So if a person goes this way or that way, you don't know where they're going to end
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.640]   up.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.440]   And so don't write them off in either case.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.640]   There are a lot of reasons, and it might be helpful for me to give you my take on why
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.080]   do people sometimes gravitate towards Roman Catholicism out of evangelicalism.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.040]   And I'll give you, here's four things.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.000]   One, many people of those who return to Rome are hungry for seriousness and are tired of
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.560]   the slapstick worship services that are normative in many evangelical churches.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.160]   Number two, many are hungry for roots, a sense of history that they don't feel in the new
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.560]   church plant down the street that seems to mainly want to hide its connectedness to any
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.200]   tradition.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.480]   Three, many are hungry for intellectual and artistic richness that worship services in
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.680]   jeans and movie clips and bouncing beach balls and the shrines of the drum set just don't
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.480]   satisfy.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.000]   And fourth, many are hungry for authority and clarity and stability.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.720]   And sometimes it's just easier to let the church tell you what to believe and to be
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.280]   unburdened by the need to work it all out.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.920]   So those would be at least four things that I think grip some people and say, "I think
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.200]   the Roman church is more satisfying in all those regards."
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.680]   But for me, Tony, even though I sympathize with every one of those, my heart longs for
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   seriousness, longs for roots, longs for intellectual and artistic richness, and loves true authority
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.800]   nevertheless.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.440]   Questions remain, don't they?
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.680]   Are the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church biblical?
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040]   And my answer is too many of them are not.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.320]   I think the Roman church gets it wrong on justification.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.080]   I think they get it wrong on the mass and the dispensing of grace.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.880]   I think they get it wrong on the role of tradition alongside Scripture.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.400]   I think they get it wrong on the authority of the Pope.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.480]   I think they get it wrong in the doctrine of baptism or regeneration, which I think
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.840]   is very destructive.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.680]   I think they get it wrong in the veneration of Mary and the prayers to the saints, and
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.080]   there are others.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.720]   And so I can't let my desire for certain forms or styles or richness or traditions
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.400]   trump the doctrinal issues for me.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.600]   So what I would like to say to those who are listening to this clip is, let's pour our
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:13.760]   lives into the true evangelical doctrines and grow churches that are strong and rich
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.120]   and serious and relevant and powerful and biblical and that overcome the weaknesses
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   that have pushed some people away.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   Amen.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.600]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
