[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.760]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.360]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.800]   On today's show, my guest is Jeff, the happy philosopher.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.200]   Jeff is a physician who faced a significant challenge in his career.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.440]   Facing burnout and depression, he had to learn new skills and new tactics
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.400]   to build a happier life for himself, even though he wasn't yet financially free.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.440]   And on today's show, we discuss his journey and the specific action steps that he suggests
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.160]   you consider taking so that you can avoid depression and suicide,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.640]   which faces so many people when they face career burnout.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.880]   Jeff, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.400]   Joshua, thanks.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.440]   Glad to be here.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.360]   So you reached out to me and said, "Joshua, I don't know if you're giving a fair shake
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.480]   to all the physicians and I might have a little bit of a different take on things."
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.400]   And you certainly have put together your own little philosophy.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.040]   You've built your own little niche in the financial freedom physician world.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.920]   Share with us a little bit about your story, especially as it relates to money and your career.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:56.000]   Sure. So let me just give you a brief background of how I got to be a physician.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   It's a pretty typical path.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.840]   I grew up just regular, normal middle class, did all the sorts of things a kid did.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.240]   Did well in school.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.680]   School came pretty easy to me.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.560]   When I got to college, I decided to become a physician.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.400]   I liked science.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.880]   I wanted to do something to get involved in helping people and a physician seemed like a good fit.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.440]   So I went to medical school, did a residency, did fellowship, and at the young age of,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.480]   the young old age of 32, started my career as a physician.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.320]   Everything up to that point was pretty routine.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.840]   My first couple years of practice were busy, difficult, but about what I expected.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.920]   What I didn't expect, however, was about probably four or five years into my practice,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.240]   I started noticing that I was becoming pretty burned out.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.560]   And I didn't really know it was burnout at the time.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.840]   I sort of diagnosed that in the rearview mirror.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.920]   But I noticed that I was becoming less and less satisfied with my job as time went on.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.120]   I had less energy.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.560]   I was anxious.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.880]   I was stressed out, becoming cynical, less efficient,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.960]   and I just couldn't recharge on my days off and on my weeks off.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.280]   So I knew something had to change.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.760]   My life just didn't feel right.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.080]   And I kind of lashed out at the one thing that I thought it could be,
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.040]   and that was my job.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.000]   And at this point, I was in my mid-30s.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.960]   I was really confused and in a pretty bad place
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.800]   because I was doing everything that society told me I was,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.600]   I should do to have a happy life.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.000]   And I was doing everything that I thought I should be doing.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.480]   But yet I was quite miserable in many ways.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.240]   So a couple of things happened that sort of nudged me in the direction that I ended up going.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:24.080]   Well, first of all, stepping back.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.440]   When I came out of training and got into practice,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.080]   in spite of being pretty frugal and careful with my spending,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.640]   and we funded retirement accounts and did all that,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.920]   I still had a net worth of about zero coming out of training.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.720]   [Laughter]
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   Welcome to the world of six-figure student loans, right?
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.200]   [Laughter]
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.680]   Right.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.840]   So I thought I was doing pretty well, and by comparison, I was.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.000]   But I had a net worth of about zero,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.200]   that the student loans about zeroed out with the retirement savings
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.520]   and everything I had done up to that point.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.880]   In 2008 or 2009, whenever the middle of the financial crisis,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.840]   that was a pretty stressful period,
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.240]   as I sort of watched 25% of my net worth just kind of evaporate there.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.480]   And at the same time, I was burning out.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.320]   I had a couple of events in my life,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   a couple of people that either died or had near-death experiences
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.640]   that were around my age or a little bit older.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.520]   And so I kind of had a midlife crisis.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.160]   I was not happy with the way things were going,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.520]   and I decided to look into early retirement.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.200]   That was my solution.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.480]   So I went on the internet and started searching early retirement.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:07.600]   And as you know, there wasn't a whole lot back in five years ago or so.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.120]   There just wasn't a whole lot out there
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.920]   when you typed in early retirement into the search engines.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:20.880]   You got the big brokerage sites giving you advice on how to retire at age 55 or 60.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.240]   And that was not what I had in mind.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   So I typed in extremely early retirement into the search engine.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.280]   And I know you know what came out of that.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:43.680]   So I stumbled onto early retirement extreme, which is Jacob's site.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:54.480]   And that was my first glimpse into sort of something that I had never even given thought.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.040]   Let me guess.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.200]   You walked into the kitchen, said to your wife,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.720]   and said, "I'm going to live on $7,000 a year.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.480]   Forget this physician lifestyle thing."
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.200]   That's not exactly how it went.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.040]   So everything about the website was just awesome.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.560]   Even the website was extreme.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.160]   I mean, it's like two colors.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.640]   There's no fancy graphics.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.520]   It looks like it was coded by Jacob himself.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.600]   Just awesome.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.840]   And I absorbed the whole thing and read his like, I think he had a 30-day plan.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:33.440]   And after I was done, I was thinking, "There's no way I would be able to sell this to my family.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.640]   I'm just, this is crazy."
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.840]   And I don't even think I could sell it to myself.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.280]   It was pretty radical compared to the lifestyle I was living.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.200]   Even though by comparison to my peers, I was still living a pretty reserved, frugal lifestyle.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:56.880]   So I was going through his site and I saw a guest post by a ridiculous sounding guy
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.440]   named Mr. Money Mustache and wandered over to his site.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.400]   And his site is quite popular and was a lot more accessible.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.760]   It just made a lot more sense to me.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.320]   It was closer to what our lifestyle was.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:24.240]   And I started going through all of the financial articles and financial independence, early
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:32.480]   retirement blogs and pretty quickly realized that it wouldn't be difficult to retire early
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.240]   with such a high income and a frugal lifestyle.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.720]   So after researching this for a few weeks or a few months, I can't remember exactly,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:54.000]   and having a particularly stressful, horrible week or weekend of call, I kind of had a breaking
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.640]   point.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.880]   I went to my wife and I said, "I'm retiring in five years.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.680]   I'll give five more years to my career and I think we'll have enough money."
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.360]   And I went through the math and just said, "That's all I can promise."
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.240]   And how many years ago was that now?
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   That was five years ago.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.960]   And so now you've walked into your boss last week and you said, "That's it.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.360]   I'm done.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.840]   I'm quitting."
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.000]   Right?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.720]   That was the plan?
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.760]   No.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.920]   So what'd you do?
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:35.600]   So after I made that conscious decision, actually my life, it was very relieving to make that
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.080]   decision.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.560]   I felt good about it.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:49.040]   But after really sort of thinking about it for a while, I started diving into some deeper
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.120]   philosophical topics and started asking myself what I really wanted.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.280]   Was this what I really wanted?
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.600]   Did I want to retire in my early 40s?
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.840]   What would I do?
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.560]   And there's a lot of literature out there and I think you've probably even interviewed
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:13.120]   people on your podcast, I know you have, that talk about retiring to something rather than
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.600]   retiring away from a job that you're not satisfied with.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.120]   And there were things that I did enjoy about medicine, about my job.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:30.240]   So I ended up looking into engineering a job share, part-time work.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:38.560]   And after about three years, I made that happen and that's what I've been doing ever since.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   So you're still in medicine, but now instead of working full-time, you work how many hours?
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.280]   How many days a week?
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.640]   I work half-time, basically.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.840]   So a job share and we split up a full-time equivalent.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.600]   And how do you actually set this up?
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.320]   What was the arrangement that you found in the field of medicine?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.720]   So I'm in radiology.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.960]   And that's where you're looking at x-rays?
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.160]   Right.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.120]   X-rays, CT scan, MRI, all that stuff.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:21.680]   So some specialties in medicine lend themselves a little bit better to job share or part-time
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.240]   work and radiology happens to be one of those.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:35.520]   So there was a situation where somebody else who complimented my skill set also wanted
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.520]   to be part-time and we just took my full-time position and now we share it.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.120]   And was this other physician was facing a similar thing or how did you find them?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.480]   She was working, so she was doing a teleradiology job, which basically you just kind of work
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:58.960]   from home.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.280]   It's shift work.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.600]   You work typically for large companies that are covering other radiology practices.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:12.480]   And it was a job that she really wasn't very satisfied in and she was looking for a more
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.960]   traditional radiology practice.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.560]   So it was just kind of a unique situation.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.160]   It was a good fit.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.000]   How common is burnout for physicians?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.040]   So burnout is actually incredibly common for physicians.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:37.760]   If you look at the most recent statistics, I think it's about at any time 50% of physicians
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.920]   are exhibiting some symptom of burnout.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:51.600]   And just anecdotally, I think that every physician is on the verge of burnout or frankly burned
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.120]   out at some point in their career.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.440]   So it is a big problem.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:04.640]   It seems to be increasing over the last five or ten years as medicine has changed.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.760]   I think some of the structural changes to medicine have contributed to physician burnout.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.160]   So it's a pretty big problem.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:24.080]   And one of the problems with talking about physician burnout is it seems like such a
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.360]   first world problem.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.600]   I mean you have a very high income, a great stable job, but yet you have physicians that
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.280]   are burning out.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.000]   And it's easy to sort of reduce it to, well, you know, you're very lucky to have this job
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.480]   and you shouldn't be burning out and just kind of suck it up.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:49.440]   But having gone through it, those sort of rational discussions, they don't make it any
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.000]   better.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.400]   So I can understand why they wouldn't make it, rational discussions wouldn't make it
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:54.960]   better.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.840]   But what I don't fully understand is the causative factors.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.200]   Because people have been doctors for a long time and you're right.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.240]   It's very time we say suck it up, people have been doctors for a long time and you
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.680]   ought to be thankful to have a nice fancy cushy job.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.240]   What is it, what are the changes that are happening or what's going on or what has
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:22.960]   changed that's led to this endemic sense of burnout that you're describing?
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.360]   So I mean that's a great question and I'm not sure I have all the answers, but I'll
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.760]   certainly try to address it.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:42.880]   So when you talk to, when you survey physicians, some of the big reasons are loss of autonomy,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:54.000]   increasing caseloads, you know, just being busier and more administrative tasks.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:03.280]   So loss of control, going faster and spending less time actually healing people and doing
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.880]   medicine and more time doing administrative tasks.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:12.480]   I think those are probably the three big things.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:21.280]   Some physicians, maybe it's about loss of income and reimbursement, but I don't really
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:21.920]   believe that.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.760]   Just anecdotally and talking to people.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.240]   I think it's something people worry about, but I don't think it's real because I've
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:41.920]   noticed that a five to tenfold difference in my income from medical school to private
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.840]   practice didn't really make a difference in my level of happiness at all.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.480]   That's really hard for a lot of people to believe.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.200]   I know.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.560]   It was hard to convince myself that it was real.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.320]   Tell me more.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:06.000]   So, I mean, some of the happiest times of my life were in medical school when I was
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.280]   living off of almost nothing.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   Medical school is very demanding and most people don't have an income.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.520]   Your only income is student loans.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.680]   And so you're living like a college student.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.160]   I didn't have much, but I was happy.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.320]   I mean, that was a great time.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:36.880]   And then residency, you make a little bit of money in residency enough to live a very
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   comfortable middle class lifestyle.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.080]   And then when you get out into the real world of practicing medicine, your income goes up
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.800]   substantially.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:55.120]   So physicians get to experience a wide range of income in a very short period of time.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.200]   And I think for some people that the money is important, but for me, it never seemed
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.640]   to be that correlated with happiness.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:15.120]   And if you look at the happiness/money literature out there, you know, above a certain level,
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.560]   above a certain amount of needs, of basic needs being met, you really don't increase
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.360]   happiness.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:28.080]   You know, when you look at people and study them and do survey data, I think, you know,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.560]   looking at all the studies I read at about 70 or $80,000 a year of spending, you really
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.960]   don't buy a lot of happiness after that.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:44.160]   You may actually be buying unhappiness in terms of complexity and obligations and such.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.680]   What was the thing that you bought or the thing that you did or what was the financial
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.320]   transaction that when you were not earning much, you thought, "Well, this will be great."
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.480]   And then you got there and you experienced it and you found out that it didn't do much
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:58.800]   for you.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.840]   What stands out in your mind?
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:08.160]   You're talking about something that I bought like in…
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.760]   Did you buy a BMW?
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:17.200]   Did you go on a fancy trip or something or do something that you thought, "This is
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.840]   going to be great."
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.200]   And then you went on and realized, "Wait a second.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.240]   This is not all that great."
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.840]   You know, nothing is jumping out at me.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:34.160]   But I do, you know, I know people that as soon as they got that signing bonus for their
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.520]   first job went out and leased a new BMW, for instance.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.400]   But I've never been that kind of guy.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.360]   I mean, I've always been pretty careful with my money, even as a kid.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:58.720]   So, but I guess in retrospect, yes.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:05.120]   I mean, just recently, and I even wrote a blog post about this, we went through this
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.480]   massive decluttering sort of minimalism phase.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.240]   And that seems to be all the rage these days, you know, getting down to like a suitcase
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.800]   full of possessions and traveling the world.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.640]   We didn't quite go to that level.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:27.120]   But we went through everything and got rid of, you know, maybe a third to a half of our
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.520]   stuff.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:36.160]   And thinking of all the money I spent on that stuff and how little of it actually brought
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.960]   me any happiness and what such a large percentage of it I never really even used.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:51.440]   So I guess in that respect, I was a typical consumer, although not to the level that I
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.720]   could have been with my income.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   And taking van loads full of my possessions to charities and just giving them away made
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.440]   me realize how much money I wasted on things that just brought me no happiness.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.080]   So it was a good exercise.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:17.840]   And I can't think of any one thing, but it's just sort of that experience and looking at
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.600]   all of the things, all the little things.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.160]   Now that you're working in this part-time job share arrangement, do you perceive that
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:34.240]   this is a lifestyle that you can sustain for the long-term future?
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.480]   Absolutely.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:42.320]   For me, it was a great change.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:49.200]   I don't know that this would be the number one thing that burnt out physicians should
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:49.760]   do.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.680]   I think that it's going to be a small percentage of people that this is going to be the right
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.400]   decision for.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.120]   It'll be very situation dependent.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:05.760]   So after I went through the financial side of things, as I said, I started going into
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.120]   the philosophical side of things and really trying to figure out what I wanted.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:16.960]   And really what I wanted more than anything was more time with myself and my family and
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.920]   more freedom.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:24.800]   So that's what I bought by getting rid of half of my income.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.240]   I bought that freedom in my life.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.800]   And it does feel a lot more sustainable for me.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.840]   I have a lot more energy for work.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.680]   I'm a lot more excited about doing it now that I have cut back.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.520]   How have you filled those hours that you were formerly working?
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.840]   You know, the time just seems to fill itself.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.480]   People ask me that all the time.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:04.320]   And I just, I, so for my personality, I enjoy the space between things just as much as I
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.280]   do the things.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.600]   So I know there's some people that just love to go, go, go.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.800]   But I like to just go on walks, go hiking, go running.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.400]   I like to read.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.120]   I like to write.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:24.240]   So mainly, mainly those, those little things.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:31.680]   Being, being with my family, I like to have more days that I am here when my kids get
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.480]   home from school.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:39.520]   Go on field trips if I want to volunteer at the schools, things like that.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:46.000]   So at this point in time, financially, how have you adjusted your financial goals to
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.880]   fit your new reality?
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:55.200]   So I really haven't adjusted much of anything.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.720]   I haven't changed my, my spending patterns.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.600]   They've, they've drifted down to a level that are, that are comfortable for me.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.040]   And in spite of still working half time, I still have an abundance of time.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.080]   An abundance of income to cover my, our, to cover our needs.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:22.320]   So really the only thing that going part time changed for me is lengthening my, my
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:28.560]   career and, you know, working towards the, the number, whatever that, wherever, wherever
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.240]   I hit that and having a much more sustainable path going forward.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.360]   I don't, I don't really worry about it too much anymore.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.160]   I don't think about it.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.440]   Do you still care about medicine?
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:46.320]   I do, but I have a different, a different attitude towards it.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.800]   Tell me more.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:24:03.680]   So I enjoy what I'm doing, but I look at it more, more now as simply an activity that
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:15.040]   I, that I trade my time to do for money in return rather than a calling or my, one of
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:21.280]   the big problems I think physicians have and, and actually let me take a tangent.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:29.440]   So one of the things that really affected me happened a couple years ago.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:38.640]   A good friend of mine from, from medical school died by suicide and he, he was a physician.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:46.720]   We were about the same age and it got me really thinking about the topic and I started really
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.960]   diving into it and physicians in addition to having a very high rate of burnout have
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.480]   a very high rate of suicide.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.960]   They commit suicide or die of suicide at about a rate two times the national average.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.840]   And it's really quite amazing when you think about it.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.720]   It is, absolutely.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.880]   And it's, it's, it's just horrible and tragic.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:18.320]   And I think part of the problem is that we get to a point in our career as a physician
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.400]   where we, we maybe hit burnout.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.280]   Maybe we start to get less satisfied with our work.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:32.320]   Maybe the administrative realities of practicing medicine and the, the monotony of it and the,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   the, it starts to wear us down.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.640]   But our ego is so tied up in our career.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.920]   Being a doctor is very different than being, you know, than any other job I've had.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:54.000]   So for instance, when I was, you know, waiting tables or, or, or bagging groceries or it
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.800]   was even a door to door salesman for a while in college, when, when I walked away at the
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.640]   end of my shift, I didn't identify at all with being whatever I was doing at my job.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.520]   I just, I became, became me again.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.640]   But physicians and ego are tied up.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.440]   You become a physician and you're always a doctor even when you're not working.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:29.040]   So I think that tying your ego to a career like this and having it become you, you become
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.400]   the physician, it can be destructive to you when, when things fall apart and they don't
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.120]   go well.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:39.200]   And I think that's one of the big reasons why, why suicide and burnout are so high.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   So I think subconsciously I just kind of untied my ego to my career.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:54.960]   And I think that in some ways it's just made me a better physician because I can go
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:02.000]   just do my job and not, not be so tied up in, in, in being a physician.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.120]   I can just go be the same guy I am sitting here talking to you and just go do my job
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.800]   and be excited about it and do it well.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.520]   So I don't, I don't know if that answered your question.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.760]   Meandered a little bit there, sorry.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:23.600]   You've written your advice for physicians, not, not who are necessarily seeking, who
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   are in the most acute stages, having suicidal thoughts, things like that.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:36.640]   But you said you've laid out five options for people who are in similar situation to
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.880]   where you once were, should consider.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.120]   Walk us through those five options and five ideas of advice.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   Okay, sure.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.840]   Yeah, I think that's a good, I don't know if it's the only framework, but it's, it's
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.160]   the framework that I, that I like.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:58.400]   And as, as I go through the five, really it's only three, but I divide them out.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.280]   There are kind of three things that you can do.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.720]   And this isn't just physicians.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.360]   This is anybody really that's, that's burned out with their career.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.880]   You can change yourself and work on yourself.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.360]   You can find another job where you can change the job you're in.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.240]   That's, those are really the only three things.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:23.120]   But I've sort of have a framework of about five things that I, that I think are helpful.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.760]   So number one is to just work on yourself.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:35.120]   So if you're in a high stress, high burnout career, it makes sense to make yourself the
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.160]   best version of you in order to withstand the rigors of that career.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.480]   And it's usually the simplest and easiest because it requires no one to change, but
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:52.640]   you, you don't have to change anyone else's mind or, or, or change their attitudes.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:59.120]   So the things that have, that have helped me and the things that I've read about include
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.680]   just mindfulness and meditation and that those sort of practices, time management skills,
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.360]   becoming effective at saying no.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.040]   That's a very important thing for a physician to, to learn how to do.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:20.000]   We tend to want to do everything and that is a recipe for disaster and burnout.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.280]   We need to learn to say no and to delegate, delegate things.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:31.360]   Becoming better at using EMR, electronic medical records, getting plenty of sleep,
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:37.200]   exercising, eating better, getting rid of addictive substances from our lives.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:44.800]   We can do all of these things and in order to help us and we should probably be doing
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.080]   these regardless of the other four things.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:56.880]   I would say a good book that I read on this and probably has a lot more information than
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.200]   I could ever give you in a podcast.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.760]   It's called Stop Physician Burnout by a guy named Dyke Drummond.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.480]   He's an MD.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.160]   He burned out.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.040]   He now coaches and the book is great.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.880]   His website is great called the happymd.com and has a lot of tactical information about
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   these little things you can do.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.600]   So for me, this, this was a big part of what I did.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:28.640]   I worked on myself and even before I went part time, I had fixed a lot of the structural
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:37.760]   problems with just my attitude and having more gratitude for my life and so definitely
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.280]   everybody should, should do number one, work on themselves.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:48.080]   Getting into some of the other things, number two is just to change your job.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.680]   Sometimes the job is just not the right one for you.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.560]   It's not a good fit.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.320]   It's less easy than working on yourself because it can be pretty disruptive to your
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:58.640]   life.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.600]   You may have to move.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:05.840]   You may live in a community that doesn't have a lot of opportunities, especially if
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.560]   you're a highly trained subspecialist.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:14.800]   You know, there may not be more than one job for a neurosurgeon in a geographical area,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.440]   for instance.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.560]   This also includes creating your own job though.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.480]   There's another doc that I'll mention here.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:29.280]   Her name is Pamela Weibel and her website is idealmedicalcare.org and she is sort of
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:33.840]   a pioneer in addition to talking a lot and writing a lot about physician suicide.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:41.520]   She is a big advocate of creating your own, she calls it the ideal practice.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.680]   So finding a practice that really fits you and that you'll be happy with.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.280]   The third thing, and this is probably the thing that I'm least knowledgeable about,
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:00.720]   but if you decided that you've done all you can with yourself, you don't want to
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.440]   change your job or you can't for whatever reason, family reasons, etc.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.960]   You can work on the system that you're in.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.720]   Now the problem with this is that it requires other people to be cooperative.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:22.000]   So in order to change a system, you have to get administrators on board, you have to get
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.680]   support staff on board, you may have to go through a process.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:31.120]   And physicians and administrators speak a different language.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:37.360]   We oftentimes are very ineffective at communicating with each other and this is just, I think,
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.440]   how we were trained, the educational system we went in.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:47.040]   So this area would require a skill set that I don't have.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:56.720]   And many physicians probably don't have the skill set and this is a good, good, changing
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:02.400]   the system is something that may require coaching or outside consultation really to be effective.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.960]   The fourth one is what I did and that's a part-time or job share situation.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.960]   Sometimes, and for me this is true, it's simply about having more time and more space
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.520]   in your life.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.440]   And if you're over all satisfied with your job and you just want more time, this is probably
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.480]   the best option.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.880]   Certain specialties lend themselves very well to this, certain specialties do not lend
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.840]   themselves well.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:39.200]   So a lot of primary care where you have a set amount of patients and they expect to see
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:46.160]   you when they come in for an office visit, it's a lot harder to do shift work or job
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.360]   share in that scenario.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.480]   But it can be done.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:57.120]   This is pretty destructive to your finances.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:05.920]   So you have to be willing to be frugal and live a life of reduced consumption and reduced
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.360]   spending to go down this path.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.280]   It doesn't have to be that bad though.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:16.000]   We're talking for some people about going from, I don't know, 400 grand a year to 150.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.040]   It doesn't have to be that bad.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.160]   That's true.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.200]   That's absolutely true.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:26.480]   But a lot of times people are, especially in like a primary care where they're starting
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:35.280]   out at a lower, if they're starting out at 150 or 180 and going to 70 or 80, that may
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.800]   be, it all depends on the level of spending that you're starting at.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:47.840]   So I know people that, you know, these financial independence bloggers, they're living off
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.320]   of $25,000 a year and they feel like they couldn't spend another dollar if they had
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.560]   to because they have abundance.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   And then I know people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, $500,000, $600,000
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.760]   a year that never have enough.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:10.640]   And I think it's worth going, it's worth cutting back on your spending and seeing if
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.040]   you can live off that before you take the plunge or else you just may not, it may not
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.600]   be for you.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.360]   You may be extremely unhappy.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:26.480]   I don't see how somebody, you know, making half a million dollars a year could not cut
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.640]   in half and be completely happy.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.320]   But everybody's different.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.840]   It requires a philosophical change.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.880]   That's the difference.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:42.400]   If you, many people have a philosophy of hedonism where the goal is pleasure in all
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.320]   of its variations and all of its forms.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:51.520]   In that context, extra expenditures mean additional pleasure.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.240]   That has to be replaced with a completely different philosophy.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.320]   There would be a few options that we could go through that would replace it.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:08.640]   But ultimately, to put it simplistically and to keep the conversation fairly mainstream,
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:17.600]   you would have to go to, you have to have some sort of philosophy that doesn't have
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.880]   hedonism as its primary core goal.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:26.400]   And that runs absolutely counter to the mainstream US-American culture around us.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.880]   Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:37.840]   And the, and I think this is what's so great about like Pete's blog, Mr. Money Mustache,
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:44.000]   is that he, he talks about these issues in a way that's very accessible to people.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.200]   And, you know, guys like JD Roth and, you know, I write about this stuff too.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.720]   I'm trying.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:37:00.960]   The framing it in terms of freedom, I think, is something that people understand.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.880]   People understand freedom.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.960]   Nobody wants less freedom.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:13.680]   So when, instead of framing something as deprivation or cutting back, I look at it as buying my
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.160]   freedom.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:24.800]   And I think that, I think that's the sometimes the easiest way to go from hedonism to frugality
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.040]   is to think about it that way.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:34.560]   You are being hedonistic, but it's not about pleasure or materialism.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.760]   It's about your freedom.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.360]   You're being very selfish about buying your freedom, if that makes sense.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.920]   So I cut you off on number four.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.600]   What's number five?
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.000]   Right.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.120]   So number five is the nuclear option, and that's just to quit medicine.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:38:02.240]   And I, this would be something that hopefully not many physicians are going to do.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:12.320]   But, you know, I've met some physicians that they just, they're just not a good fit for
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:12.720]   medicine.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.880]   They don't enjoy what they're doing.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:22.240]   And the problem is that there is such a fixed high cost in terms of money and time to become
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:29.120]   a physician that you get so far down this path, you know, after training that you're
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:36.880]   30 years, you're in your early 30s, you have a ton of debt, and you've got one skill.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.960]   And usually you can't even pick which part of medicine you're going to work in.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.240]   You've got, you're very specialized.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.800]   So you're pigeonholed into a very specific career.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.560]   And if you don't like it, it can be quite distressing.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:39:03.520]   This is probably the most destructive to the ego and the finances, unless you have some
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.440]   other skill set or you can leverage being a physician to become something else.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:16.160]   And I know people who've done this, who've gone into consulting with like biotech companies
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:22.240]   or have gone into the financial planning or financial space.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:31.040]   But I only know a couple people and I don't think that a lot of people end up doing that.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.360]   But that's certainly a possibility.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.000]   Let me run an idea past you and I'm interested to know if, I'm interested to know what you
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.240]   think.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:47.840]   I'm relatively ignorant with regard to the screening that medical schools do to determine
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.360]   whether or not the field of medicine would be an ideal career choice for varying personalities.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:40:02.240]   But it seems to me like one of the contributing factors is the young age at which many people
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:10.640]   pursue medicine and the absence of life experience that they have to identify whether or not it
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.520]   might be a good fit.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.200]   And I'll give a couple of examples.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.080]   There are two friends of mine.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.800]   One of them is presently in medical school in his mid-30s.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:29.200]   The other one was a peer of mine who went through medical school under the ideal, excuse
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.880]   me, under the standard bright academic track.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:41.360]   And so the first option, my peer, and this is probably indicative of several of my friends
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.560]   who've gone into medicine.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.000]   They seem to be, number one, academically extremely capable.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.400]   You have to be academically capable in order to pass the vetting process to get into medical
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.040]   school.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:59.040]   So very, very focused, work hard in high school, good grades, good student, move into college,
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.480]   pursue the biology track or related to biology probably in some way because of the focus
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.080]   and intense academic focus.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:13.280]   My observation is that many of these students, their primary expertise and skill is in academics
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.960]   and that limits some of their extracurricular activities, some of their extracurricular
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.520]   exposure.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:22.720]   They just don't have, they're not working a lot of times in varying jobs.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.080]   They're just focused on academics.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.360]   Perhaps they come more likely, my guess.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.240]   I could be wrong.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.120]   I'm just guessing.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.560]   It's more likely to come from an affluent family who's supporting them financially.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.080]   Just focus on your studies.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.400]   I've watched a few of my friends go right in, get their undergraduate degree, get the
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.840]   biology degree, move into med school, right through med school, right into specialty,
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:49.280]   right into residency, right into all the stuff you guys do to get the highly specialized.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:55.520]   And here you come out of school at 30 and the very first thing is that highly placed
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.200]   specialty, but the number of, the amount of exposure to different fields, to different
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:01.520]   things.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.880]   I remember talking with several of my friends who've gone through med school.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.720]   They're trying to figure out what they want to specialize in.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.080]   So they're interning here, interning there, but it's all related to medicine.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:17.200]   And it seems to me like a lot of physicians jump into that path because they have the
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:22.160]   skills for it and they're academically and intellectually suited for it without really
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.720]   getting a chance to test drive it or without being aware of all of their other options.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:32.560]   Now, if I compare that to a friend of mine who never had any interest in pursuing medicine,
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:38.880]   has worked at, supported himself at different things, became an EMT, was a firefighter,
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.680]   working with various ambulance companies, et cetera.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.880]   And then later this particular person recognized they really wanted to be a doctor and they
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.680]   wanted to be an emergency room physician that had been proven out through years of focus
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:57.120]   and now this person in their mid-30s is putting their way through med school to become an
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.320]   emergency room physician.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:05.440]   I am much more confident that that career is going to be a perfect fit for this particular
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.400]   friend because they've test driven it for years.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.600]   They know of this interest.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.480]   It's an interest that has survived for a long time and I think their career will be long
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.400]   and appropriate for them.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:21.600]   And I feel like we do, especially physicians, a disservice because we do college students
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.160]   in the US American system a disservice because we send them right into school and then they
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:32.000]   come out and you're starting and just trying to figure things out at 22, 25 years old.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.920]   Whereas physicians even worse except there's another decade of school on top.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   And we know that a lot of people, very few of us, use our college degrees in our current
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.440]   careers in any capacity.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.360]   And so it's a little easier though if you just switch from, "I got a four-year undergraduate
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.320]   degree in this study over here and I'm just switching to something else."
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.160]   That's less costly than it is as you described if you've invested 15 years.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.560]   Do you think it would help if we approach the career process a little bit differently?
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:04.400]   Yeah, I mean those are really good observations, Joshua.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:10.480]   And I agree with a lot of what you said and a lot of the sentiment.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:19.440]   For sure, one big problem with medicine and actually a lot of careers is that you're forced
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.480]   to make decisions about things before you really have all the information.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.240]   And it's hard to get all the information.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:36.080]   It's very difficult to know what it's like to be a physician without actually becoming
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.600]   and being a physician.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:44.720]   And I think some careers are just like this, like a firefighter or police officer or a
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.280]   soldier.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:51.440]   You know, you can intellectualize it and imagine what it will be like.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:59.520]   But when you start getting into these very stressful kind of different careers, it's
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.160]   hard to know.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:10.320]   And certainly, I think like your friend you described who was an EMT and then decided
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   to become an ER doc.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:19.360]   I mean, that's a great way to become a doc, I think, because you know exactly what you're
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.080]   going to get.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.520]   You've worked around the system.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.920]   You know what to expect.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:32.480]   And for me, I know that every step of the way was different than I thought it was going
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:32.720]   to be.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:40.320]   That being said, I think there's a lot of people, in fact, maybe most of my medical
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.800]   school classmates, I mean, they just knew that they wanted to be a doctor.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:50.320]   And even in practice, they couldn't imagine being anything else.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:46:01.760]   The big problem I see with careers that require so much upfront investment is, number one,
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.640]   you don't know how the industry is going to change.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:08.000]   I mean, medicine has changed a lot in the last 20 or 30 years.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.960]   It's really, if you talk to docs in their 50s and 60s, medicine, practicing medicine
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.880]   is very, very different now than it was.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.200]   So you don't really, you can't really predict how the industry is going to change.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   And you can't predict how you're going to change.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:33.600]   My attitudes and philosophies and things that are important to me have changed a lot
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.480]   in the last 10 to 15 years.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:44.400]   Not the core things, but a lot of the things that I thought, like I said earlier, would
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.880]   make me happy ended up not making me happy.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:56.800]   So I don't have a great solution for that other than the fact that knowing yourself
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:02.560]   and knowing, trying to figure out what you want from life, knowing your personality,
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.440]   whether you're introverted or extroverted or what your tendencies are, knowing that
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.160]   stuff as early as possible in life, I think, can help guide you into a career that will
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:12.880]   be appropriate.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:23.200]   And maybe interning or shadowing docs early on as high school students or in college is
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:23.920]   a good idea.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:29.840]   Hard to think, hard to implement on a large scale.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:36.400]   I think a few people do that, but it would require big structural changes, I think, to
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.000]   really have it make a big impact.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.520]   And it's across our society.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.840]   My own anecdotal experience corroborates what you said, that many of my friends who've
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.440]   gone the medical route, they always knew that was what they wanted to do.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.560]   They were very focused.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.360]   They knew that this is going to be what I'm going to pursue.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.520]   And sometimes you got to do that.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.840]   You got to follow it, of course.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   But it is daunting to me when you look at, exactly as you described, the costs that are
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.320]   involved.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:13.360]   And on the concept of knowing yourself, there's a philosophical distinction.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:22.720]   And even though your blog is called The Happy Philosopher, I'm trying to rein in myself
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.680]   in and not pursue these philosophical rabbit trails that we could.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:33.040]   But first, I'm not philosophically aligned with the idea that introspection is the – that
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.400]   truth is not found internally, which is a major philosophical divide.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:42.320]   But the biggest practical application is just simply without a diversity of life experience,
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.400]   you don't have anything to know.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:51.520]   You can't without – I mean, I can't say it any better.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.720]   Without a diversity of life experience, you don't have anything to draw on.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:49:01.520]   The most boring people in the world are those who've done just one thing and pursued one
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.120]   thing because they – and they can talk about their unique specialty.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:10.800]   The most interesting people in the world – think of a Dos Equis commercial.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.240]   The most interesting man in the world was a man of diverse experience.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:24.480]   And I'm judging by my own experience here, but I can't imagine knowing who I am, knowing
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:30.080]   the things that are a fit for me, and having any confidence in that if I didn't have a
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.160]   broad and diverse experience.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:38.720]   I know we can't create a rule for society, but I see it as a major challenge that the
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:48.640]   medical field faces with such a focus of – such a long-term focus at the beginning of a career
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.680]   without a broad and unique and diverse life experience.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.880]   It's a tough career fit.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:50:01.760]   Yeah, I actually agree with that. I think that's what caused me to introspect and
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.440]   try to figure things out and look around and scratch my head in my mid-30s.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:14.160]   I'm not sure knowing what I know now if I would have chosen medicine as a career.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.640]   I don't have regrets about it.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.840]   I'm not unhappy.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.920]   I mean, I'm really the happiest guy usually within arm's reach of myself.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   I'm a very happy guy.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:35.120]   I don't have regrets, but I'm not sure had I had more knowledge when I was in high
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.720]   school and college that I would have chosen the path that I did.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.200]   I mean, it's a paradox.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:41.920]   It is.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:49.520]   I'm glad I am where I am because all of my – who I am today is a result of everything
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.400]   that's happened to me.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.760]   And I wouldn't change anything.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.320]   I mean, because I love my life right now.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.560]   So I'm glad that I went down that path.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:05.440]   But I guess for my clone in another universe, maybe I would advise him to do something different.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:05.920]   I don't know.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.840]   We're going to start talking about the multiverse next.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:14.160]   The reality is two roads diverge in a road – two roads diverge in a wood and we took
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.360]   one of the roads and you can never go back to that point in the past.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.400]   We can only go forward.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:26.320]   Have you seen being connected to the practice of medicine and also paying attention to finance,
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:35.600]   have you observed anything about physician financial behavior that for you stands out?
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.840]   I've got some opinions on the subject but coming from the financial planner background
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.560]   is – I'm probably more biased than as a physician.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.800]   But what do you think about the way physicians handle money?
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:50.160]   I think physicians are some of the worst people at handling money.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.380]   Why?
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:56.000]   So there's a bunch of reasons.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.800]   So first of all, doctors are really smart like intellectually.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.240]   But they're not smarter than anybody else with money.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.960]   They just have more of it to make mistakes with.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:16.400]   And when – like I alluded to earlier, in a very short period of time, you go from being
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:22.400]   broke to being middle class to being rich for all practical purposes.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:31.200]   And you have this length of training, medical school and residency which is anywhere maybe
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:38.880]   7 to 12 plus years where you're working hard, you're not making a lot of money,
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:44.560]   you're working incredible hours and it's all about sacrifice and delayed gratification.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:53.040]   And then when you get out of training, there is all this pent up demand for consumption
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:59.280]   because you deserve it and you're fatigued of delayed gratification.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.800]   So a lot of docs come out of training and just go crazy which is the absolute worst
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.600]   thing to do.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:11.120]   The best thing to do is to come out of training and slowly ramp up your lifestyle or keep
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.360]   it how you had it as a resident and kind of grow into it.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.440]   But a lot of docs don't do that.
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.440]   So that's the number one thing.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:26.640]   Number two, and this goes back to kind of basic financial stuff, is when you look at
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.040]   your biggest financial expense, for most people it's their house.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:37.600]   And physicians for, in my experience, most of them buy way too much house.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:45.040]   They just, they love buying land and building houses and spending a lot of money on housing.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.160]   And that can, so that can be pretty, pretty destructive.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:55.360]   The, also buying vacation homes, this seems to be a very popular thing for physicians
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.400]   to do and that's probably never a good financial decision.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   I've seen it work out a couple times where they've used them more as rental properties.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:10.560]   So going crazy coming out of residency, buying way too big of a house.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:19.200]   You know, this is not unique to physicians but divorce is a financial weapon of mass
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.000]   destruction.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.320]   I mean, it is just, it's horrible for finances.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.520]   Even the best planned divorces are incredibly destructive.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:36.960]   So choosing a spouse who aligns with you on your major philosophical issues like money
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.720]   and things like that is very important.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:44.960]   Do you know anything about the divorce rate among physicians as compared to other professions?
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.800]   I don't, actually.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.680]   I don't either.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.720]   I'm just, I was just curious.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.320]   I don't have any insight into it.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:58.480]   My hypothesis would be that it would be perhaps slightly higher than some others simply due
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.800]   to the stresses of the lifestyle and the stresses of the job.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.440]   I could be mistaken in that I have no data to support that.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:10.480]   But it certainly seems like it can be a very difficult, especially when you're a physician
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.840]   who's on call, things like that.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.600]   It can be very taxing on relationships.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.720]   Yeah, it is.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:17.840]   I mean, it can be.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:24.800]   I'm going to look that up after this podcast because that's an interesting question and
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.000]   I don't know the answer to it.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.760]   But yeah, divorce is not good for finances.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.240]   It seems to me the biggest challenge of being a physician and what you described about time
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:43.280]   at house or divorce or vacation homes or any expenses associated with lifestyle is the
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.640]   problem of your reference group.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.200]   And most, we all have a reference group.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:56.800]   We all hang out with people and our lives are going to reflect other people's, our lives
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:02.480]   are going to reflect the people with whom we associate predominantly.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:09.360]   And as a physician, your group of association, physicians just like financial planners, I
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.720]   understand other financial planners better than people who aren't financial planners
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:12.960]   are.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:18.480]   Physicians are going to understand each other more than people who are not physicians.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.400]   You're going to be able to discuss the normal daily challenges of life.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:30.320]   And how that impacts financially is if you're accustomed to going on snow ski vacations,
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.280]   you can't just talk to everybody at your workplace and say, "Hey, by the way, would
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.240]   you like to go to Utah this year or go to Colorado?"
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:41.360]   And yeah, to take the family, it's going to be 20 grand, but that's all right.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.320]   We're going to do it.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.040]   You can only do that with your certain reference group.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:51.200]   And what happens is you wind up, most of us, we don't wind up intentionally choosing our
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:51.760]   peer group.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:57:01.200]   We wind up in a peer group or a reference group just simply after the fact by happenstance.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.840]   It's where we've landed.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:09.600]   And then we unconsciously start to adopt the habits and practices of our peers.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:18.640]   It's harder to say no when you are invited on the snow ski trip than it is if – it's
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.000]   just harder to say no.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.360]   And so when you add on to it, like you talked about of the intelligence, the status, the
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:32.160]   ego, and I'm not being disparaging here, just recognizing that you are a different
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.360]   type of person.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:38.400]   You also have the need to maintain impressions.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.240]   And we want to be with people who are like us.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:46.240]   So all those things can very easily lead to a high consumption lifestyle.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:52.160]   And unless you're very proactive about consciously choosing something different and unless you
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:58.480]   have the self-confidence to be the weird one, it can lead to a high consumption lifestyle.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.960]   Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:07.840]   I mean, I think that summarizes a lot of the problems in not just positions, but a lot
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:15.680]   of high income earners is that the human mind really is pretty poor at absolutes.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:23.920]   Like we don't know whether we're happy or comfortable or doing well in a vacuum.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:27.280]   We have to look around and who do we look around to?
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.560]   We look around to our peers.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:38.880]   So if all of our friends are driving $50,000 luxury SUVs and going on five trips to Europe
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:45.520]   every year and living in 4,000 square foot homes, that's our norm.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:50.000]   We're going to associate with that group of people.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:57.360]   So I think it is very important to stay grounded and to not get sucked into that.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.040]   And unless it's something that's your thing, fine.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:10.400]   But if your goal is financial independence, then those two things are not compatible.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:10.640]   Right.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.160]   And I want to point out two additional thoughts on that because I think it's important.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.080]   First, to affirm what you said, it's not just positions.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.440]   It's the same in financial advice.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:24.160]   I can't tell you how many financial advisors, and there's tons of people listening to this
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.640]   show, who this will happen to.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:35.920]   So many financial advisors come into the business of financial advice with a practice of frugality
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.000]   because they recognize that your expenses need to be lower than your income.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.920]   So they practice frugality.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.240]   They get pretty good at handling their own money.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.840]   They say, "I'll go be a financial advisor.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.600]   I'll help other people handle their own money."
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.920]   And then they come into the world of financial advice.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.680]   They begin from frugality.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:58.880]   But over time, as they start to adjust, they start to feel weird and start to feel weird
[00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.760]   and say, "Wait a second.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.040]   I'm not so sure."
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.640]   I could list several stories.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.600]   I won't to protect the guilty, but I could list several friends of mine who I've watched
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.040]   systematically come into the business being very frugal and wanting to help people and
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.480]   preach frugality.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:20.160]   And a few years later, they're justifying to me, because they have a guilty conscience,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.280]   not that there's anything wrong with a BMW, but they're justifying to me that buying a
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.680]   BMW is an intelligent financial decision.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.080]   Now, ignore for the moment the importance of signaling theory and all of that of trying
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.360]   to project a success.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.080]   They are not thinking about that.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:40.400]   They're telling me, "Oh, it's a good buy," blah, blah, blah, and they're justifying to
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:40.800]   themselves.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.320]   And I recognize it because I almost did it myself.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.240]   And I always thought I was pretty inoculated against it, and I almost did it.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.880]   So it's very, very difficult to do it.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.640]   The second major thing, and this affects financial advisors, it affects physicians, it affects
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.680]   attorneys, it affects high-income professions when you have this peer group.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:05.600]   It's important to point out that some people can easily afford five trips to Europe every
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.440]   year and a brand-new BMW every year and a brand-new luxury SUV every year.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:18.480]   Some people can easily afford that while still becoming massively wealthy because of a high
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:18.800]   income.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:30.400]   If you are a trial attorney and you're making $5 million a year, a $150,000 vehicle is meaningless
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.080]   in your financial life.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.080]   But the problem is that trial attorney is sitting with other attorneys who go by the
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.640]   – who have – their business card says attorney, but they're not making $5 million
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.120]   a year.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.560]   They're making $350,000.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:52.080]   And now all of a sudden, they feel that pressure of the peer group, but they don't have the
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.760]   same financial opportunities.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.320]   The neurosurgeon is in a very different financial state than the primary care physician.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.800]   And so you don't actually know who can afford it and who can't.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.240]   Same thing in financial advice.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.680]   Remember, 20% of the financial advisors are going to make 80% of the money.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.720]   4% of the financial advisors are going to make 60% of the money.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.000]   So you walk into a financial advice office and the guy sitting on one office is making
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.920]   $2 million a year and the guy sitting in the next office is making $130,000.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.400]   But yet the reference group is next door and that's one of the – is the guy in the
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.440]   office next door.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.600]   That's one of the reasons why it's so destructive because you start to add that gentle social
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.760]   pressure of, "Hey, you bought a round of drinks.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.800]   I'll buy a round of drinks.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.520]   Hey, we'll go out to the fancy place and maybe you're the – I was here.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.240]   I was this guy."
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.320]   You don't really particularly want to be the – go out to the fancy dinner but now
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.200]   you've got the social pressure to accept the invitation and you don't want to look
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.000]   like the cheapskate.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.720]   You don't want to look like you can't afford it, blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.680]   And now you wind up spending $200 on a night out when you prefer to do something different.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.720]   So it takes a lot of self-confidence to stand against the tide.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:04.080]   It takes a lot of clarity of your own goals and vision and self-confidence to come against
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.600]   these social forces.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.080]   You're absolutely right.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.320]   I mean, that's spot on.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.000]   Life is so easy when it's on paper.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.680]   But we unfortunately have to live our lives in the real world.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:25.200]   So things that are rational and make sense, once we start really living it, it breaks
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:25.840]   down a little.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.080]   And yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:35.200]   I mean, our reference group really influences us.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:41.600]   And that's what was so great for me and I think for a lot of people.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:49.200]   They get a lot out of the Financial Independence, Financial Freedom blogosphere and the podcast,
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:56.640]   your podcast and others that expose other people that are doing things that are totally
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.520]   different.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:05.120]   So we can read about these and we can hear about these people and we can use those
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.880]   people to associate with.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:15.040]   You know, even though they're not our peers that live down the street, it was very comforting
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:24.720]   to me to read all of these Financial Independence blogs and Mr. Money Mustache and all the blogs
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.320]   that I'm sure everybody reads who's interested in frugality.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:33.680]   You get involved in that community and that becomes your reference point.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:40.080]   It becomes a counterbalance to the consumerism and just the craziness that we're all exposed
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:40.560]   to.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:47.200]   So yeah, I mean, your podcast is great, Joshua.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.800]   And you get a lot of these people on, a lot of diverse opinions about things.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.680]   And you open up a lot of rabbit holes to explore and go down.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.040]   I appreciate that.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.720]   Good, good.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.400]   I love your podcast.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.200]   So you've been blogging for a little while now and I think I had at least some influence
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:10.160]   on your beginning your website to some degree, thehappyphilosopher.com.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:15.360]   Tell me what you've learned since starting to put your ideas and content out there into
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.800]   the world of the internet.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.280]   Yeah, real quick, just to let people know.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.960]   Yeah, I did write a blog post where I referenced to you how a podcast can change the world.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.760]   And it was an interview you did, who was that guy?
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:35.040]   JB Glassner, was that his name?
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:35.520]   Mm-hmm.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.080]   Yeah, MorningCoach, the morningcoach.com.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.960]   Yeah, and I was just listening to the podcast and just kind of walking.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:50.960]   I was on a walk actually and he told the story about how his writing and his online presence
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:55.200]   had really impacted somebody and made a huge difference in their life.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.360]   And I thought to myself, I mean, I actually stopped.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.480]   I stopped the podcast, I sat down, I had to absorb it, listen to the story again.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:11.360]   And I said, "You know, I think everybody should do this.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.240]   Everybody should tell their story," or as I refer to it as just downloading my brain
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.600]   on the internet and see if somebody can make use of it.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.840]   Blogging has been pretty cool.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:31.520]   I'm not sure, I've learned to be a little bit better of a writer.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:36.960]   I think to get my ideas a little clearer, it's made me more disciplined.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:44.160]   I've never been a disciplined writer and having a blog sort of holds you accountable,
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.240]   as I'm sure you can attest with the podcast.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.280]   It kind of holds you accountable to create.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:57.440]   And I think that either a blog or a podcast is creating something, it's creating art
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:57.940]   in a way.
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:05.120]   And it's been pretty therapeutic for me to write and get my ideas out there.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.640]   I've had a lot of fun.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.400]   - Good, and I'm glad that you're doing it.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.720]   And I'm glad that my show was able to be some encouragement in that direction.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:19.200]   I'd love to see, I want to see every listener of the audience begin some form of
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:20.560]   expression.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:26.720]   Blogging, podcasting, video, whatever, making local speeches to your local Rotary
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:32.640]   organization, whatever it is that is appropriate and whatever the next technology is.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:38.560]   Because if nothing else, it forces you to be a better learner.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.760]   You're going to go, because of the thoughts that you've expressed on this show, you're
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.040]   going to go and research physician rates of divorce and you're going to be thinking about
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.160]   that subject.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:51.840]   And I'm forced and held accountable to being a better, more effective learner because I'm
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.240]   forced to share my thoughts and I don't want to sound like an idiot.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.480]   So it's a good impetus in our lives.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.200]   And also you can help another person.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:05.840]   And that person to person contact can be tremendously, tremendously valuable.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.000]   - Yeah, and I think just one last comment on that.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.040]   I think people are nervous about starting a blog because they don't think it's going
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.640]   to be that popular and you know what, it probably won't be.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:27.360]   But even if you reach just a few people, I mean some of the coolest things I've learned
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:35.200]   are on blogs that are pretty tiny and that have sort of nudged me in a direction and
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.760]   made me think about something in a different way.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:43.520]   So you don't have to reach, you don't have to have a blog like Mr. Money Mustache where
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.600]   I don't know how many page views he has.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.920]   But you don't need that.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.960]   That shouldn't be the goal.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:57.120]   The goal should be in the creation itself of content and making you a better person and
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.560]   maybe helping somebody else.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.720]   I think we're all, or most of us are wired to want to help others.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.160]   And I think blogs and podcasts are really a great way to do that with a very low barrier.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:13.040]   - Yeah, and two suggestions for you and for anyone else.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.720]   First, I agree with you with regard to numbers.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.160]   Unfortunately, we have a tendency to always think that big is better.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:27.360]   But any person who's writing something, just imagine yourself simply writing let's say
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.600]   on your Facebook feed and you write something that gets 40 likes.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:36.800]   So you know that maybe a couple hundred people have read what you've written.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.200]   Imagine yourself in a room speaking to a couple hundred people.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.160]   First, that's a place of incredible privilege.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.360]   To be honored by the attention of a couple hundred people who are looking at you and
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.600]   listening to you is a tremendous honor.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.040]   And it's also pretty scary for many people.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.520]   And yet people discount the value of having a couple hundred readers of their thoughts.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:10.800]   It frustrates me because we diminish, many people diminish their impact because they
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.880]   recognize that they're not the most popular.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.680]   Popularity is fickle.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.720]   It comes and goes.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:19.040]   And it's not even particularly valuable.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.960]   It can be valuable if you've been able to stay authentic and true to your message, which
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   is the second danger I'll talk about in a moment.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.640]   But it's much more valuable to impact a few people with something that matters.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.920]   And the second point is that popularity brings with it a whole set of problems and a whole
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.800]   set of dangers.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:47.440]   I actually prefer generally to read unknown sources and not popular publications because
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.400]   people are generally more willing to be honest and they're more willing to speak clearly
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.680]   based upon what they believe.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.560]   Where when you go into mainstream popularity, the danger is instead of speaking clearly
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.520]   and directly about what you believe, you start to have a desire to be popular and you start
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.600]   to modify your message with the goal of maintaining popularity.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.200]   And this has happened, you can see it in the lives of many, many, many people.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:20.240]   They become prominent because of their ideas, but then they abandon their ideas with the
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.960]   goal of maintaining their fame and their prominence.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.800]   It happens, I mean, you could see this every day in the political sphere.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:32.000]   How many times have you been disappointed because you saw somebody that stood by their
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.520]   ideas, you thought, "Wow, this person will stand by it."
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.600]   You vote for them and all of a sudden a few years later, they've completely buckled.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.120]   The fame and the popularity got a hold of them and it's a real challenge to maintain
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:51.600]   your commitment to your ideas and your ideals in the face of losing that popularity.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.960]   So, why did I go into that?
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.640]   Simply to say that don't judge your success based upon the large numbers.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.840]   Recognize that statistically it's improbable that any of us will ever have large numbers.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.680]   However, that doesn't mean it's not worth doing.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.320]   Mike Alfred: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.360]   It's just a win-win to write and to create, I think.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:23.520]   You know, when I first started, I was very, you know, looking at the statistics and I
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.200]   was worried about them and, you know, how do I grow the blog?
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.080]   But now I have a much more relaxed sort of zen attitude towards it.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:41.760]   I mean, I'm just, I realize you should do it for you, not to please other people, I
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.240]   think.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.200]   Is that why you do your podcast?
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.160]   It is and everything I just shared is from personal experience.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.640]   I started the podcast because I felt it needed to exist.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:13:00.000]   But as the show has grown and become more popular and more mainstream, I often find
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.160]   myself wrestling with that problem of should I take this tack?
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.680]   Should I do a show on this topic, et cetera?
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:13.360]   And I have to continually, consciously lay aside the desire for mainstream acceptance
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.160]   and stay the course to what I believe should exist.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.320]   The allure of fame and fortune is strong.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:32.800]   It's a siren song that many sailors have succumbed to and it's extremely challenging to
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.000]   withstand it.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:48.720]   And yet, one thing that I find helpful is I respect people who stay true to their opinions
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:54.400]   or beliefs or convictions or philosophy or whatever word you want to insert there.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:00.160]   I respect people who stay true to those things even in the face of difficulty, even in the
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.800]   face of the fading fortunes.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:11.600]   And so, among other things, I remind myself that if you respect those people, you've got
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.400]   to – it's easy to respect other people but yet not want to do it yourself.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.680]   But it's important to do it.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.120]   And the only way that – I mean, one of the ways that freedom and liberty are advanced
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.080]   is by many more people doing that.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:31.920]   That's why we live in the golden age of this and I'll wrap it up.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:37.200]   But we live in a golden age but it only happens – of freedom to express and influence and
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.560]   impact at very little financial cost.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.320]   And I want to see more people do that.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.840]   But it's certainly – it's a challenging process.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:49.440]   It's a challenging growth process to stay true to.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.560]   RIDGEN: It's unbelievable how many opportunities are out there.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.040]   I agree.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.720]   It is.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:03.440]   We live in a remarkable time and yet it's our responsibility to maintain it and to be
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.480]   faithful in this time.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.000]   So, Jeff, thank you for coming on.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.080]   Any final words of advice that you'd like to share about and any particular content
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.480]   or resources that you'd like to share with my audience?
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.800]   JEFF BOOTH: Well, I'll just give you my blog.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.560]   It's thehappyphilosopher.com.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:27.360]   I have a contact form on there and all the social media buttons if anybody wants to reach
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.040]   out to me or tell me their story.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:41.920]   I would say that anybody who is on the edge, either suicidal, pre-suicidal, depressed,
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:46.400]   burned out, don't give up.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.920]   There are a lot of resources out there.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.480]   Seek them out.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:58.000]   Seek out the people that really are passionate about this stuff and care about it and get
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.320]   out of that spiral because it's really quite fantastic on the other side.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.280]   I can attest to that.
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.800]   RIDGEN: Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.760]   And I'll say, if anyone – I'll just say personally, if anyone is in that situation,
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.800]   call me, email me.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.680]   And I mean that sincerely.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.640]   In closing here, it is very important to be in that situation.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.840]   I don't know that it's – I think the – I don't know.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:33.120]   Maybe you've got a magic philosophy or formula, Jeff, that results in your continually being
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.880]   up, but I don't have one.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.120]   I find that life is cyclical.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.640]   But oftentimes, when you're in a period of challenge – if you're in a period of
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:52.000]   challenge and – when you're in a challenging period, it can feel very difficult and especially
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.600]   difficult if you stay in your own head.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.480]   The last few weeks, up until the last couple weeks for me, were very challenging weeks.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.240]   And you can't stay in your own head.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.760]   You've got to involve other people.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.600]   It's dangerous to stay in your own head and to try to go it alone.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:15.120]   So I mean I haven't talked about suicide on the show, but if any listener is number
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:20.000]   one, if you're just feeling down or if you are – hey, if you're suicidal, I'm
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.520]   not – I'm not counseling or anything, but call me.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.440]   My phone number is 561-386-6034.
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:25.840]   Text me.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.800]   I don't answer the phone.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.840]   Text me and I'll call you.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.240]   So 561-386-6034 is my cell phone number.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.400]   Anybody can ever reach me if they're ever in a difficult situation and they just need
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.200]   a friend to talk to.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.520]   It's an important subject.
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:43.760]   We don't talk enough about it, but it's an important subject.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.160]   Kind of a downer to end on, but it is important that we talk about it.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.040]   Yeah, I know it is important.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.040]   I mean suicide is a medical emergency.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.400]   I mean and you're absolutely right.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.800]   Don't try to get through it yourself.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.720]   Reach out to somebody – a physician, a counselor, a suicide hotline, a friend.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.880]   You're a person who cuts your hair.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.120]   Reach out.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:07.600]   Get help.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.360]   Depression and suicide are horrible.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:17.360]   And my friend from medical school, I mean that was awful.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:23.280]   Yeah, I guess we'll end on that high note.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.760]   Jeff, thanks for coming on.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:30.560]   It's not a high note, but it's real life and that's what podcasting is about.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.480]   So thank you so much for coming on today.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:33.520]   Joshua, thank you so much.
