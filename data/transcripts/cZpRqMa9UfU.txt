[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Self-hate.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   It's a topic that gets talked a lot about now.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.240]   So how would you go about sharing the gospel with an unbelieving friend who struggles with
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.240]   self-hatred?
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.040]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you so much for what you've been doing.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.160]   I'm Reynaldo from Jakarta.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.200]   I listen to your podcast more than I read my Bible and I should change that habit."
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.660]   Yeah, exactly, Reynaldo.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.200]   You should change that ratio immediately.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.700]   My question, I have a friend and she is a Buddhist.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.960]   She struggles with self-hate and I am confused about what I have to do about it.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.080]   I listen to her and I want to help, but what should I do?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.000]   I could give her a self-help book, I suppose.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.640]   I'm afraid if I get straight to the gospel, which I don't have a problem saying to her,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.440]   she will not listen to me.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.280]   But if I give her a self-help book with tips about overcoming this anxiety, I'm afraid
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.480]   that she might improve without experiencing the forgiveness of Christ.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.760]   So I guess I want to share the gospel with her sooner than later.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.960]   If you had a non-Christian friend who struggled with self-hate, how would you proceed?
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.120]   "Well, let me just underline Tony's misgiving about reading or listening to Piper more than
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.120]   the Bible.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.680]   That really is a serious problem, so fix that.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.280]   The Bible is the source, Piper's just a muddy stream, so fix that."
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.880]   This question is difficult to answer because there's just so much to say from the Bible
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.040]   about someone struggling with self-hate.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.320]   The problem in answering this question is not a lack of biblical material that addresses
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.320]   it.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.640]   I don't know her, and I don't know Reynaldo.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.240]   I just need so much more information about what her true issues are, what's gone on to
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.380]   bring her to this point, how is it expressing itself, how deep and serious is it, and on
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.380]   and on.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.520]   So I really want to be careful here.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.360]   I'm going to make some suggestions, but I make them provisionally as to what the best
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.160]   strategy here is, and trust that the Holy Spirit will help Reynaldo to know what to
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.180]   do with what I say.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.520]   What about drawing her, Reynaldo, what about drawing her into a discussion about biblical
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:42.520]   passages that lead to a sharing of the gospel through her own curiosity and her own perplexity
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.120]   about those very texts, those passages that you share with her?
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440]   Here's what I have in mind, and I'm thinking this might be a path forward because of the
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.600]   little bit I know about Buddhism and because it just comes to my mind as I pray for how
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.640]   to help.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.680]   Here's what I have in mind.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.720]   Ask her if you could give her some passages from the Christian Bible with a view to getting
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.560]   her opinion about what she thinks about them and how they make her feel.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.200]   If she's a Buddhist, she would probably approach them in a more or less moral or philosophical
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:32.340]   way, so you wouldn't expect that she would have any grasp of the gospel at all.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:41.400]   You simply want to get her into God's Word on a topic that is very relevant to her.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.200]   Now if she's willing, then you might share with her texts like these.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.160]   You might give her a whole Bible, put some bookmarks in, circle the verse or show her
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   where to find them, and that way she would be able to read the context as well if she
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.680]   were curious.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.840]   But you would be pointing her to verses like this.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:09.660]   John 12:25, "Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.280]   will keep it for eternal life."
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.760]   Now that will really perplex her, I would presume, really bother her, which is what
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.680]   we're after.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.880]   Or John 15, 12, Jesus said, "This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.040]   you.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.860]   Greater love has no one than this, and that he lay down his life for his friends."
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:46.340]   Or Acts 12, 24, Paul says, "I do not count my life of any value, nor as precious to myself.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.900]   If only I may finish my course and the ministry that I receive from the Lord Jesus to testify
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.880]   to the gospel of the grace of God."
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.200]   Or Revelation 12, 11, "They have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:09.480]   of their testimony, for they loved not their lives, even unto death."
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.360]   Or Matthew 22, 37, following, Jesus said, "You shall love the Lord your God with all
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.520]   your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind."
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.620]   This is the first and great commandment, and the second is like it.
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.440]   You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.300]   On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.420]   One more, Matthew 10, 28, following, "And do not fear those who kill the body, and after
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.740]   that cannot kill the soul.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.980]   Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.560]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny, and not one of them will fall to the ground apart
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.180]   from your father?
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.080]   Even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:56.580]   Fear not; therefore, you are of more value than many sparrows."
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:04.400]   Now my guess is these texts will simply leave her baffled, and hopefully she would, when
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.820]   you have your next conversation, she would say, "What in the world did you give me these
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.780]   texts for?"
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.180]   And you would say, "Well, let's just take them one at a time and show me what they made
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.620]   you think and feel."
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.620]   And you're into it.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.180]   You're into it.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:27.940]   Where you go from there would depend almost entirely on how she responds to these passages.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:35.540]   My assumption is that she would be really perplexed about a passage like John 12, 25
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:44.820]   that calls for self-hate, and some that assume self-love, Matthew 22, 39.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.900]   And then from there you'd want to lead her toward teachings about sin in relation to
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.300]   the glory of God, and talk about how that affects our worth.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.740]   And then hopefully you'd go towards the coming of Christ and His death, who laid down
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:08.460]   His life, a kind of self-hate for the sake of our life, 1 Peter 2, 24.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:15.300]   Then you'd move on from there to how that purchases sinners to love them and forgive
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.980]   them and accept them and possess them as His treasured possession, 1 Peter 2, 10.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:29.700]   And that would lead on to a life of loving and treasuring Christ more than life itself,
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.580]   because He's so valuable.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.540]   And that would lead on maybe to the promises you could give her that we will be changed
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.940]   into the image of Christ.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:47.860]   All of our hateful, sinful ugliness will be taken away, and Jesus will return and transform
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.940]   our lowly body.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.540]   I don't even know if her issue is body hate or if it's mind hate or soul hate.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.580]   I don't know what's going on, but He's coming back to give all of us a brand new
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.620]   body that's glorious like His glorious body.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:10.740]   So who knows where the Lord may lead these discussions, Reynaldo, but what I'm suggesting
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.740]   is this.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:19.100]   Instead of a frontal presentation of the gospel, for which she might have zero categories in
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:30.300]   her Buddhism to comprehend at first, try drawing her into a serious give-and-take engagement
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.060]   with the Bible.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:39.620]   The Bible is sharper than a two-edged sword, penetrating to the division of bone and marrow,
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.220]   soul and spirit, Hebrews 4.12.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:52.100]   And then pray earnestly for the Lord's guidance toward the gospel, where she can see—I pray
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:09:02.940]   she will see—what self-hate looks like, feels like, when it is deeper than she thinks
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:09.980]   and yet redeemable by the amazing blood of Jesus and what God's done to save her.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.980]   Yeah, amen.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.940]   And as you were talking, Pastor John, I couldn't help but think that this is really a great
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.140]   way to evangelize any friend, you know, isolate some of the texts that most clearly speak
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.580]   to their own questions and life situations.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.780]   Go and read them apart, come back together and study and discuss them together.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.780]   I love that approach.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.420]   It's so simple but brilliant.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.980]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.940]   Well, what's coming to America?
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:42.740]   Can we anticipate widespread spiritual revival or should we expect a deepening social degeneracy?
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.380]   What can we anticipate in America's future?
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.580]   It's a great question and it will end our week together.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.580]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.300]   I'll see you back here on Friday.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:51.800]   Bye.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   [END]
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   [END]
