[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Sydney and in this episode we want to talk about
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.420]   Generational wealth and why there's so much angst of the not rich enough class
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.360]   But before we do, please don't forget to sign up for our weekly newsletter at financial samurai.com
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.100]   Forward-slash news and if you enjoy this ad free podcast
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.080]   We'd really appreciate a positive 5-star review as well as picking up a copy of by this not that at financial samurai.com
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.720]   By this not that
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.320]   So the other week some parents had asked me whether I had read a column in The Washington Post
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.720]   Entitled the 400k conundrum and in the post it talked about how households making 400k and above were struggling to make ends meet
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.300]   They didn't feel rich
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.040]   Even though they had a top 2% income now if this sounds familiar
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.260]   Well, I've been writing about this subject since I started financial samurai in 2009
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.860]   Talking about earning two hundred thousand dollars not having much left over
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:09.320]   Making three hundred thousand dollars and living a middle-class lifestyle and even making five hundred thousand dollars and kind of scraping by that
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.020]   Was actually one of my most popular posts out of all time
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.720]   because there was a lot of pissed off people who read and said how can you make five hundred thousand dollars and
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.560]   Just scrape by and never be able to escape the rat race
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.840]   Well, I proved in each one of these posts with a budget a very detailed realistic a budget about
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.920]   How quickly money can go as a result?
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.520]   I think there is a lot of ongoing angst and anxiety
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.920]   From some of these high-income earning households that seem to have at all great jobs upward mobility everything
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.360]   However, based on my years of research, I think the three main reasons why there's so much angst and anxiety
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.440]   are the following one never-ending comparison to a lack of generational wealth and
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.840]   three having children
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.960]   so before we had children, I
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.640]   Didn't feel that much angst and anxiety while I was making six figures a year working in investment banking
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.040]   Did you feel that I had any anxiety or did you have any angst and anxiety before we had children?
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.200]   No, I think a lot of it all it pretty much started once the kids came
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   Right, and so that's the thing
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.760]   When I wrote scraping by on five hundred thousand dollars a year, this was two years before we had children
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.960]   But I wanted to empathize with households who just couldn't get off the rat race
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.600]   I mean after all I had left a multiple six-figure job behind several years earlier
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.640]   And I was thinking myself. Well if I could do it, why can't you too?
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.080]   But the real difference between then is that back then I didn't have children
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   And now we do so now I clearly understand why there is so much ongoing
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   Anxiety with these high-income earning households and you find many of them many of them in some of our larger cities like New York City
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.720]   San Francisco, Los Angeles
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.000]   Where Seattle I think everywhere like for example if you get a job in tech
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.800]   You're starting comp is around
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.160]   150 to 200 thousand dollars as a 22 23 year old and it's the same thing with finance and management consulting
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.440]   So and then and then if you couple
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.040]   Couple up then that's double the income, right? So I feel this anxiety comes from having kids and
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.000]   Worrying worrying that our kids will not have it as good as us
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   because ironically the more you make the higher your income the harder it is for our kids to match that income and
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.800]   Potentially our lifestyle. So Cindy, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.840]   Whether you have anxiety about our children's future and in terms of them making money and living a comfortable lifestyle
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:00.520]   Yes, if I start thinking about them having to apply to college and interviewing and finding a job I get stressed out quickly
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.840]   But then I have to remind myself, you know, they're not they're not at that age yet
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.200]   You know, we're trying to get through elementary school. So we still have a long runway
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:19.280]   but I think a lot of parents can easily start to worry especially as their kids get into the teenage years and
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.640]   College becomes closer and closer
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.400]   You know, not just the cost but actually getting in it is so competitive
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.860]   you know, you hear all these stories on social media about such and such student who had
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.720]   Straight a's did all these extracurricular activities, you know
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.180]   They had this amazing looking resume and then they didn't get into any good schools
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.600]   It's I think it causes a lot of anxiety for parents. What do you think? I think so as well as you know
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.840]   I've been obsessed with
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.600]   Colleges and college rankings and getting into college since you've known me. Yeah, the College of William & Mary. I just find it to be fascinating
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:02.080]   Because I got rejected at too many places and it didn't feel good, but things turned out. All right in the end
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.640]   I think things turned out better than expected and to me it feels like where you went to school
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.480]   Matters only for your first job and then after that it's about what you do
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:20.600]   How you communicate how friendly sociable you are and the network that you build the problem with college and
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.140]   Sending our kid to school is that we are injected back into society
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.200]   And so we meet a lot of parents and this is the comparison point, you know who are doing a lot
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.880]   They're sending their kids to four different sports sporting activities
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.840]   They're sending their three to four year old to go skiing when I'm like thinking really
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.640]   Why three to four years old it's kind of painful skiing and it's so expensive
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.440]   the tickets here up in
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.960]   Palisades Tahoe is
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.940]   $199 a day now, obviously you want to get the season pass but $199 a day is
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.320]   Crazy expensive and I don't know who can afford that comfortably
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.120]   And so when you hear about other parents spending so much and doing all these activities and flying everywhere
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.060]   You start naturally feeling some FOMO. I mean, do you feel any kind of FOMO?
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:15.440]   For me oddly not so much maybe later, you know when our kids are older. I don't feel like I'm
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:24.760]   Missing out from sports activities. We tried soccer for example with our son and he wasn't into it and I was okay with not
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:33.000]   Going for it or not signing him up for basketball. I think we're just focusing on our our kids interests and I
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.840]   Don't have that kind of anxiety with missing out on activities though. But what do you think? I
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:48.080]   Mean, I always question whenever a parent says, oh we took up our son skiing and he's four years old
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.320]   And I'm thinking I said, oh we haven't taken them up at all
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.560]   I guess it's because for me I didn't learn how to ski until the first time I tried it. I was in middle school
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.680]   Yeah, so and then I didn't learn how to snowboard until I was an adult in college
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.120]   So for me, I don't feel like we need to teach a five-year-old
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.480]   Snowboard. Yeah, especially if they're not interested. Yeah, and we're not big
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.640]   snowboarders either
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.560]   It just depends on I guess the family's interest. Yeah. Yeah, I mean
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:27.040]   It is interesting though because you don't really know how well you're doing, you know, whether it's making money in your career
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.920]   Or being a parent unless you compare yourself to other people
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.680]   And that's one of the reasons why a lot of the posts that I've written on, you know
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.320]   Like the average net worth for the above average person, you know
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:45.080]   How much did you have accumulated by age 401k savings by age five to nine plan amounts by age?
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.600]   these posts and
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.160]   Charts in my book by this not that help people
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.840]   Gauge where they should be or where they could be if they did everything
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.760]   appropriately and that's very important because I continuously tell people you shouldn't wing it when it comes to your finances because
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.360]   You'll wake up like ten years later and wonder where all your money went because you winged it and that's that's not the wise move
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.680]   so as parents
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.720]   I think we have this constant fear that if we don't do everything possible and
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.120]   If we just wing it by raising our children and just having them do whatever they want
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.480]   They're gonna miss out on opportunities or we might not be able to discover
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.400]   You know the hidden Mozart or that amazing composer or that artist we don't try everything
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:39.200]   Yeah, maybe so for those of you who don't have kids you might be rolling your eyes or thinking what the hell are we talking?
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.600]   About well, it's hard to know what you don't know and I'll tell you straight up before having children
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.880]   My anxiety and stress was focused on climbing the corporate ladder
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.280]   Saving and investing as much money as possible so I could get the hell out of investment banking by the age of 40
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.080]   that was where my stress anxiety lay and
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.440]   Also difficult clients who were super demanding at all hours of the night. It was just no fun
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.220]   But beyond that now it's not about me
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.320]   It's not about you and it's about our children who are
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.280]   Essentially helpless and starting from zero and trying to understand the world and they're gonna go through some growing pains some painful moments
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.280]   and we just have to be there and
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:27.880]   If you look at the landscape, ooh the competitive landscape of every single thing we're doing getting into college
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.280]   Getting a job
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.820]   Let's say starting a personal finance site
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.880]   Writing a book. Oh my gosh, the competition is
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.200]   Intense. Yes, and then when I look at the resumes of these high school students
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.120]   Congratulations to all parents and students who got into their colleges and if you didn't get into your dream college recently
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.520]   Well, it's okay things will work out fine
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.360]   If you learn practical knowledge and you network and you become a good person
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:02.440]   I'm saying like there's so much competition out there that if you don't have this intense focus. I
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.360]   Don't think people are going to get to where they want to go. What are your thoughts?
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.560]   Yeah, I feel like the landscape has changed so much even in just ten years
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.800]   You look at the acceptance rates for some schools like Tulane Tulane
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.160]   20 years ago acceptance rate was like, I don't know. I was like 30 40 percent
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.720]   I think now the acceptance rate is 10%
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.680]   Huge change the same thing with schools like Boston University
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.480]   I remember that was like a safety school where a lot of rich families went, you know, who didn't get into Harvard and MIT
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.800]   It's Boston College. It's fine. And those are very hard schools to get into
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.280]   but I remember that that school that had an acceptance rate of like
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.080]   37% or 40% and now the acceptance rate of Boston University is 10%
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.200]   And it's the same thing with USC USC 20 25 years ago acceptance rate was over
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:59.000]   30% and now I think it's in the single digits. Oh my gosh. So what's going on here and
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.280]   given there's been this talk about a
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:09.880]   De-emphasis on merit so a lack of correlation with hard work and merit and getting in places
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.640]   That's also a cause of a lot of stress and anxiety. Yeah
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.880]   But I have a feeling and I think it's not a feeling I know this
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.200]   I feel like I think about the future and these things way more than you. Yes. I feel you're much more happy-go-lucky
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.120]   Let's see what happens. You are a long-term planner. Absolutely
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.160]   now
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:38.200]   It is the reason why you don't think so intently about these topics is because I'm already thinking about these topics
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.000]   Or it's just your personality. I think it's a bit of both
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.760]   I think I I tend to focus more on the short term, you know, like okay what's going on at school this week?
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.760]   What do we need to bring in?
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.800]   It's just separation of tasks I guess as we like to talk about
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.720]   so
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.000]   You definitely have a great strength at long-term planning. So I'm very fortunate
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.280]   But why don't we all think more long-term we think long-term about investing for the future?
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.800]   We think long-term about eating healthy now, so we don't suffer
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.440]   debilitating disease and health problems in the future
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.720]   Why don't we just think longer-term
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.400]   Maybe just the
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.960]   Desire to focus on now now now now as our as our preschooler loves to say I need it now
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:39.600]   Well, I suggest everyone to start thinking three years five years ten years fifteen years in advance
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.440]   Why because thinking is free and if you can create different scenario
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:50.320]   Analysis in your head. I think it helps when that time comes you won't be left wondering. Uh,
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.300]   What should I do? You know pre-mortem planning and analysis is so important
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:02.380]   Yeah now, so let's say you are one of the parents who feel stressed out about your children's future
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.060]   Well, here is the solution. There are three main solutions that I can think of
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.480]   One is to make generational wealth now
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:18.700]   What is generational wealth generational wealth to me is having enough wealth where you can pass down to your children and they'll never starve
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:24.540]   But I did a poll on financial samurai and you can participate in the poll if you are there's about
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.160]   2,000 participants and it asked what is
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:36.320]   Generational wealth. What is the minimum threshold? I had six choices having at least 1 million net worth to pass down
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.980]   3 million 5 million 10 million 20 million and 50 million and
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.180]   the number one vote getter is
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:51.100]   10 million dollars 30% of the votes and the number two vote getter is 5 million with 23% of the votes
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.340]   The third is 20 million
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:14:01.380]   The fourth is 3 million. The fifth is 1 million and the last option is 50 million with 7% of the votes. I
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.460]   Personally voted for 10 million
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:10.180]   Which is close to the estate tax threshold now, it's twelve point nine two million
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.960]   What do you think is the right generational wealth figure?
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.020]   You say five and and how did you come up with five?
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.620]   I mean 1 million these days just doesn't sound
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:30.020]   It's a 1 million is obviously a lot of money, but it doesn't have the same
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:35.860]   Impact. I think you wrote a post that said 3 million is the new 1 million due to inflation. Yeah, so
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:41.940]   you know, I thought about 3 million as well, but I felt like 5 million was you know a
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:49.060]   Big enough bump up a 2 million is a big difference between 3 and 5. Yeah, what made you come up with 10?
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.880]   Well, what what made me come up with 10 was because one it's a nice round number the two
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.880]   It's very close to the estate tax threshold
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:05.800]   Previously, it was like twelve point two million and then eleven million ten million and the top a top 1% net worth
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.260]   Figure in America is now over 10 million. I think it's like over 12 million
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:18.380]   Basically the estate tax threshold is the top 1% net worth threshold. It's very close
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:26.740]   So I figured well if you can accumulate up to the state tax threshold and then give it to your children and other
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:32.460]   Institutions or whatnot and not have to pay 40% tax that seems like generational wealth
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:39.780]   Yeah, but the fear about giving all that money away is that you know from rice paddy field to rice paddy field in three generations
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.820]   Which means the first generation has nothing they work their butts off to accumulate wealth
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.580]   The second generation inherits the wealth and tries to maintain the wealth and then the third generation
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.420]   They didn't have to bust their butts accumulating any wealth and then they spend it all and it goes back to poverty again
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:04.020]   So there you have it the number one recommendation to feel less stressed about your kids future is to generate 10 million dollars
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.880]   Easy peasy. There you go. Now, of course, not everybody's gonna get there
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:14.340]   But with enough time we could get there, you know, it's just about time and compounding returns
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.220]   so maybe everyone should do an exercise where they take their net worth currently and
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:25.340]   Plug it into a calculator and run some different scenarios on how long would it take for their net worth to get to?
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.660]   10 million based on different durations of time and different rates of return
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:38.380]   The second strategy to reducing anxiety for your children is to give them housing security now housing
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.940]   Almost in every single budget is the largest budget item generally
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.620]   Recommended 30
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:52.460]   30% or less I recommend 10% or less of your household income goes to living but it's generally around 30 to up to 40%
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.660]   So if you can get that housing equation that expense out of the way
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.900]   By the time your children are adults. I think that is huge
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.340]   For no longer worrying about them because at least they'll have a place to live
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.380]   Everything else from clothing to food to transportation
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:18.460]   Transportation is not as expensive. So the one recommendation I have which other it's interesting
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:24.420]   This curved article from New York City wrote an article said said oh your landlord could be a baby and they highlighted
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.620]   My post on the suggestion
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:32.780]   But the idea is that when you have a baby or before you have a baby or before the baby the earlier the better
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.260]   basically buy a rental property and
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:42.460]   In 18 years the rental property could be paid off and it should definitely be spitting out a lot of cash flow
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:47.300]   So when your child is an adult if they don't go to college or even if they do go to college
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:52.420]   they could earn money from that rental property to pay for their living expenses or
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:59.140]   they could live in that property if their job so happens to be where that property is and
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.740]   Then if they were able to find a job that is not in the same city where the property is
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.740]   Well, that's fine. We parents can then use that property to fund our
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.260]   Retirement so it's a win-win scenario. What do you think about this strategy?
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:20.780]   I think it's very creative and definitely unique way to provide security for
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:26.500]   Your children in the future. I don't know how many people would actually be able to do it
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.820]   but I think it's it's a great way to
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:37.020]   Set a goal that can benefit benefit your kids and potentially benefit yourself as well if they don't end up
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.220]   Wanting to manage it or live in it
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:45.740]   So one property per child is my baseline recommendation
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:51.820]   So two properties two children and so forth one commenter did make a really good point though
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:58.740]   And he said don't buy a property when your child is born because that first year of life is chaos
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:06.140]   Crazy and you might be stuck with some tenant issues maintenance issues and it'll make your life a living hell
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.580]   and I totally believe that because in 2017 I
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:17.340]   Sold our old house and our old rental property because it was giving me nightmare headaches. It was always five four or five dudes
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.660]   throwing parties bashing at the place and
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:27.820]   Neighbors complaining and there's some deferred maintenance yet some leagues change some windows
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.260]   Turnover to turnover because we have four or five roommates. There's always turnover every single year
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:39.580]   So it's a real PIT a and I hear you. However, if you can get things through
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:44.100]   rental properties owning real estate is a war of attrition
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.860]   the longer you can hold on the longer you can survive the more wealth you will build for you and your family and
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:56.340]   Once you get to that maximum, I do like investing in public REITs and also private real estate
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.940]   Fundraise is my favorite platform. I've worked with them for years and check them out at financial samurai.com
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.140]   /fundraise it's a way for me to earn
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:13.420]   real estate income passively and diversify our expensive real estate holdings in San Francisco Lake Tahoe and Honolulu
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.700]   Towards the Sun Belt now the final strategy to help reduce anxiety
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:23.580]   for your children is to start and maintain a
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.860]   Lifestyle family business if you have a family business, you are the boss you can do whatever the hell you want
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:35.780]   Especially if you have no outside shareholders, what is you know, the thing that we worry about most
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:42.260]   Living expenses housing shelter, right and also whether our children will be able to get jobs
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.060]   and
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.900]   So if you have a family business
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:51.940]   Even if they don't want to work at your family business if they have no job and no way to make money
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.380]   Well, there's always going to be this career insurance policy for them
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:03.200]   And this is something really common with immigrants many immigrants own small businesses
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.820]   restaurants
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:09.640]   Laundromats things that don't really need a super high education
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.980]   But you can do by bypassing the gatekeepers
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.500]   So long as you have some money and some hustle and some ingenuity
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:23.820]   And the other thing is if you build your family business large enough, it could knock out something else
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.820]   Which is your goal to try to achieve?
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:31.860]   Generational wealth it could be three million for you five million ten million from my definition
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:40.020]   Whatever your definition is of generational wealth having a small business that generates income for your family and also generates
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.500]   equity that can be multiplied because businesses are
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.020]   Traded off multiple of revenue or of operating profits or of net profits
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:55.740]   Every single dollar you make from your small business actually boosts your equity by multiple fold
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.420]   Alright, so we have three solutions generational wealth owning rental properties
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.580]   Maintaining a small business and you can also teach your children as they grow up
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.220]   Here's a final point. I want to make
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.100]   Downward mobility is still a good life folks
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:16.940]   You don't need your children to earn as much as you to have the same lifestyle as you after all
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:23.940]   Our lifestyle middle-class lifestyle today is way better than a king and Queens lifestyle from centuries ago
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.140]   Our lifestyles continue to improve thanks to technology
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.380]   medical breakthroughs and more so don't think
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:38.220]   Each generation needs to earn more money and have a better lifestyle than the last
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:45.060]   Our lifestyles are pretty good as they are right now. I mean just speaking into my recording machine my iPhone
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.060]   I mean, wow, I've got this awesome
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:52.300]   Computer the size of nothing that I can carry around and do so many things with I mean
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.460]   This is a huge breakthrough over the past
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:02.140]   15 20 years we will always worry about whether our children will get into a good school or get a good job
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.180]   But I think if we can spend a lot of time with our children
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:12.740]   Educate them on what we know about provide them practical knowledge. I think whatever they do
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.660]   They're gonna turn out. Okay, because at the end of the day our
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:22.780]   Current standard of living is pretty good compared to the past. Thanks so much everyone for listening
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:29.060]   We'd love to hear your definition of what generational wealth is if you have any anxiety and angst
