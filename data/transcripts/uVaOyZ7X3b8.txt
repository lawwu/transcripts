[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Podcast listener Nora writes in,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960]   hello Pastor John, I'm a freshman in college
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.180]   and just started a relationship.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.200]   We are both Christians and want to keep God
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.760]   in the center of our relationship.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.920]   However, I find myself making our relationship
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920]   and my boyfriend an idol.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.560]   I depend on him for my happiness
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.980]   and I think about our relationship
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.880]   more than I think about my relationship with God.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.440]   How can I stay away from that
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.920]   and what does relational idolatry look like
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.520]   for someone in a new relationship like mine?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.040]   - Well, amen to their mutual desire to keep God central.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.760]   Amen, amen.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.080]   Would every couple be like that?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.540]   Seems to me that Nora already has a significant picture
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.200]   in her mind of what idolatry looks like
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.040]   because she thinks she's in it.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.480]   At least in some measure,
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.760]   I think she's being really honest there
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.800]   but her heart is against it, which is a good sign.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.800]   I wonder if it would be more helpful for me,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.440]   to her in describing the positive alternative to idolatry
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.040]   in a new relationship so that she might recognize idolatry
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.800]   as the opposite of these things
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.200]   and so would be able to put her energies
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.600]   not so much into avoiding something
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.280]   as pursuing something.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920]   So that's the approach I'm gonna take.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.360]   It seems to me that there are at least three ways
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560]   that Nora can think about the way her new romance
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.320]   relates to her relationship with Jesus.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.300]   First, she can think about it comparatively.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.720]   How does her affection for the boyfriend
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.880]   compare to her affection for Christ?
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.240]   She's sort of thinking that way already.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.480]   Second, she can think of her relationship
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.880]   to this young man as an expression
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.280]   of her relationship to Jesus.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.640]   And third, she can think of this new romance
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.600]   as a way of strengthening
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.320]   or building her relationship with Jesus.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.800]   So let me take those three one at a time
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320]   and just point to the scripture
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.720]   and how she can think about those.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.960]   The Bible speaks of our relationship to good things
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.040]   or good persons that God has made
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.640]   as if those things were in a sense
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.660]   nothing in comparison to him.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.160]   But it does so comparatively speaking.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.160]   That is, in relation to the infinite value of Jesus,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.640]   the value of other things or other people are as nothing.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.200]   So for example, Psalm 73, 25,
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.240]   "Whom have I in heaven but you?
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.840]   "And there's nothing on earth I desire besides you."
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.520]   She loves her boyfriend.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.240]   "Nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.020]   "My flesh and my heart may fail,
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.680]   "but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   Or here's the way the Apostle Paul puts it,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.400]   Philippians 3, 8, "Indeed, I count everything as loss,
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.160]   "boyfriend included, because of the surpassing worth
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.260]   "of knowing Jesus Christ my Lord."
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.260]   Now, we know from other things that the psalmist and Paul
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.400]   say that the good things that God has made,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.880]   like the people of God, whom both the psalmist and Paul
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.800]   say they find great delight in.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.880]   I mean, Psalm 16, 3 and Philippians 4, 1,
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.760]   both the psalmist and Paul talk about their,
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.980]   the people of God as their great delight.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.440]   So they're not nothing, they're their great delight.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.080]   So we know from those statements
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.080]   that God's creation is not counted as worthless
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.860]   or as merely an occasion for idolatry,
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.860]   but the test, they're the test of our faithfulness.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.720]   And the test is, are we able to say with the biblical writers
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.540]   that if I lost everything,
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.120]   God would be enough for my everlasting joy?
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.000]   That's the comparative idea.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.720]   So she can view this relationship comparatively,
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.600]   and that's the one she's having trouble with.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.880]   So maybe these next two will help her
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.360]   manage that one better.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.120]   Nora should cultivate this new relationship
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.600]   with this young man as an expression
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.240]   of her relationship with Jesus,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   a way of acting out or showing her relationship with Jesus,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.920]   not just a threat to her relationship with Jesus
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.440]   or in competition with it.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.840]   For example, Ephesians 5 describes
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.320]   the marriage relationship between a man and a woman
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.480]   as a drama or a picture of the relationship
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.600]   between Christ and the church.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.320]   Now that deeply changes the way a man and a woman
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.040]   look at their relationship.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.560]   It's not just about them, it's about showing him,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.800]   showing, expressing him and his covenant relationship
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.000]   to his bride and the church,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   and therefore an intense love for a man by a woman
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   or a woman by a man can and should be transposed
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.240]   into the music of a divine drama
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   so that the intensity of the emotion for the person
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.760]   is not in contrast to emotion for Jesus,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.160]   but an expression of emotion for Jesus.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.120]   So here's the principle that Paul laid down
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.160]   in Galatians 5, 6.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.400]   He said, "In Christ, neither circumcision or uncircumcision
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   "is of any value, but only faith working through love."
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.600]   In other words, faith doesn't exist
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.320]   in a vacuum of spirituality.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.120]   Faith expresses itself, faith shows itself,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.720]   and the fundamental way that faith shows or expresses itself
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.680]   is in the fruit of love, faith working through love.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.680]   So Nora should ask herself, "As I love my new boyfriend,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.320]   "is it merely competing with my faith in Jesus,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.880]   "or is it expressing my faith in Jesus?"
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   And the last one, the third way to look at her relationship
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.560]   with him is, is this relationship strengthening
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.760]   and building her faith and his faith?
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.600]   When the Bible thinks of relationships in general,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.280]   it uses this principle, 1 Corinthians 14, 26.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   "Let all things be done for building up."
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.760]   That's the meaning of relationships.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.360]   Let everything be done for building up.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.460]   For example, Hebrews 3, 13.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.820]   "Exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.440]   "that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   So the aim is that the relationship would serve faith
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.340]   and serve holiness, serve the overcoming of sin.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.480]   So the question for Nora is,
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.220]   is the new relationship working, is it having the effect
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.840]   to build me and him up in our faith?
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.720]   Are we trusting God more?
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.080]   Are we loving God more?
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.920]   Are our lives marked by more passion for holiness
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.000]   because of what we're finding in each other?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Is it strengthening or is it weakening our love for Christ?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.200]   So here's a summary.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.720]   Nora, pursue the relationship in three ways.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   One, pursue it as a good thing,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.760]   which in comparison to an infinite thing is a no thing.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   Two, pursue it as an expression of your faith
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.200]   in Jesus, not a competition with your faith in Jesus.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.760]   Find ways to express your faith in this relationship.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   Number three, pursue it as a means of strengthening
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.460]   and building up your faith and his faith,
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.440]   not weakening them.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.340]   And if those three aims are being realized,
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.340]   I think the Lord is keeping you from idolatry.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.840]   - Brilliant, thank you, Pastor John, for that balance.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.080]   And we return tomorrow.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.200]   A podcast listener has a question
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.160]   about how you, Pastor John, would counsel someone
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.720]   who is addicted to human approval.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.600]   It's a great question.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.960]   It's a very necessary one that we need to tackle
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.920]   and we'll do so tomorrow.
