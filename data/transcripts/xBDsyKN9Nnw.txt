[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   Well, today's question comes to us from a listener named Andrew.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.360]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.440]   I was wondering if you can explain the difference between God's holiness and God's righteousness,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.340]   and how does that apply to us?
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.640]   What does it mean that we are supposed to be holy and righteous?
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.080]   What is the difference for us?"
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:33.160]   If we start at the bottom, that is where we live, I would say that the kind of behavior
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.780]   that would be called holy and the kind of behavior that would be called righteous are
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.400]   in fact the same behavior, but viewed from different angles.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.860]   In other words, I don't think it's ever the case that we would do something that would
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:03.080]   be called righteous but would be unholy, or that we would ever do something called holy
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.960]   that would be unrighteous.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:14.680]   So when it comes to the actual deeds and attributes, all holy behavior will be righteous behavior,
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.480]   and all righteous behavior will be holy behavior.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.960]   That's the first thing.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.820]   Now, that doesn't mean that the words are identical in meaning.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.060]   So what's the basic difference?
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:39.400]   The essential idea behind the concept of holiness is being separated from, distinct from, that
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.200]   which is ordinary or common.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.660]   So in its initial usage, it could refer to something bad or good.
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.600]   There might be a temple prostitute who's holy because she's not an ordinary prostitute.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.520]   But in the Bible, that's not the way the word holy is used.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.860]   Holiness has taken on a moral meaning that derives from God's holiness.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:15.240]   In other words, God is separated from all that is not God and is in a class absolutely
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.920]   by himself, which means that God, like the rarest diamond in the universe, absolutely
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.760]   unique, is infinitely valuable.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.320]   His holiness, therefore, most essentially consists in his absolute uniqueness and therefore
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.880]   the infinite value of his beauty and his excellence.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.020]   He's in a class by himself.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.000]   He's above all things.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240]   He's sui generis.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.100]   He's distinct from everything that is not God, and therefore he is of infinite and of
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.380]   absolute worth.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:06.040]   When Isaiah 6 describes the angelic beings crying out, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   of hosts.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.240]   The whole earth is full of his glory."
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.360]   It seems to me that the reason it doesn't say, "The whole earth is full of his holiness,"
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.560]   which is kind of what you'd expectâ€”"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.440]   The whole earth is full of his holiness."
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   And it doesn't say that.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.580]   It says, "The whole earth is full of his glory."
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:40.560]   The reason, I think, is that holiness is conceived of as the intrinsic worth and beauty and purity
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:50.240]   and value and excellence of God, and his glory is conceived of as what that looks like when
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.120]   it goes public, when it fills the earth and is made visible for humans to see.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:06.200]   He is holy, holy, holy, and he fills the earth with his public manifest holiness called now
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.080]   glory.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.920]   Now this implies that God's holiness in action is all of his thinking, all of his
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.920]   feeling, all of his doing, which is in accord with his infinite value.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.920]   That's the way I'm defining God's holy action, holy thinking, holy feeling.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.240]   If God ever acted in a way that somehow contradicted his utterly unique existence and his infinite
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.600]   worth and beauty, his action would be unholy.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.880]   Now right at this point, there's an overlap with the concept of righteousness.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.480]   Righteousness doesn't have the basic idea of being separate and distinct from what is
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.200]   common.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   Righteousness has the basic idea of conforming to a standard, and when that standard is conformed
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.800]   to, the behavior, the thinking, the feeling is right.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.640]   It's right.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.200]   And you can see how the two concepts produce the same behavior, because if you ask what
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.400]   is the ultimate standard by which all thinking and feeling and acting should be measured,
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:34.880]   the answer for God and for us is the absolute worth and beauty of God himself.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.560]   Or you could say in its manifest form, the glory of God.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.800]   Everything you do should be in accord with the glory of God, the worth of God manifest
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.720]   in his glory.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:57.520]   All behavior that is consistently done in accord with God's glory is righteous behavior.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.700]   It conforms to the highest standard.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.680]   And just in passing, I'll say we have the Word of God because as sinners, we can't know
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.400]   all that conforms to God's worth without his guidance.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.280]   So if somebody says, "Well, what about the Word of God?"
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.800]   I say, "Oh, the Word of God is indispensable, but I want to define righteousness and holiness
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.760]   as what they are intrinsically, not just to say, 'Obey the Word of God and you're righteous.'"
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.220]   That would be true, but it wouldn't tell you why it's ultimately righteous.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.560]   So the Word of God is indispensable in telling us what does conform to the infinite worth
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.040]   of God and to the glory of God.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:47.280]   When the psalmist says in Psalm 147.11, "For your namesake, O Lord, preserve my life.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.880]   In your righteousness, bring me out of trouble."
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:57.180]   That parallel between "for your namesake" and "in your righteousness" gives a clue.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:04.420]   For God to act in his righteousness is to act for his namesake, that is, for his glory,
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:13.900]   that is, in accord with the ultimate standard of his glory or his manifest worth and beauty.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:21.520]   So my conclusion is that God's holiness is his complete and utter uniqueness distinct
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:29.480]   from all other beings in his infinite and absolute worth and beauty, and that his holy
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:36.520]   behavior is behavior that accords with that infinite worth and beauty, which means it
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:44.820]   overlaps with his righteousness, which is his unwavering commitment to the highest standard
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:54.640]   imaginable, namely his glory, which means that when God acts in a holy way, he is always
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.940]   acting in a righteous way and vice versa.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.960]   And that's true of us as well.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.900]   When we are distinct from all that is sinful and bring our lives into conformity with God's
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:19.140]   infinite worth and beauty, that is, when we're holy, we are at the same time acting in righteousness
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.780]   because we're conforming to the highest standard in the universe.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.780]   Amen.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening and making the podcast part of your
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   day and your commute.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.860]   It is an honor to join you as part of your day.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:38.100]   And for more about this podcast, check out our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:45.820]   Well, I'm not sure what's up next on Wednesday, but I do know that we have a trio of Reformation-related
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.060]   episodes in the works, one talking about the five solas of the Reformation, another one
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.180]   talking about your, Pastor John, your favorite biographies of Reformers, and then we are
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.020]   going to have a 30-minute conversation with a Reformation scholar coming up.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.900]   We haven't published many long-form conversations of late, but we hope to publish one soon,
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.540]   talking about how Martin Luther single-handedly made the printing press and the book publishing
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.100]   market into what we know of them today.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.740]   All of that is coming up later this month as the monumental 500th anniversary of the
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.740]   Reformation approaches at the end of October.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.420]   For now, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.580]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor, John
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.580]   Piper.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.580]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
