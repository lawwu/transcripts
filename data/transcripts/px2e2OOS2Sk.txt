[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   -
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:16.340]   - Hi, I'm Lizzy.
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.040]   I'm a developer advocate at CloudFlare.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.880]   - And I'm Nick.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.760]   I'm a developer experience engineer at WorkOS.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.120]   - Yes, so at CloudFlare, I make a lot of AI demos,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.120]   AI MCP servers, anyone here also making any of those?
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.300]   Agents?
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.580]   Nice, of course, should've guessed, 'cause conference.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.720]   So I've been having fun making agents and MCP servers
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.540]   that act on behalf of me.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.740]   I built an agent to auto vote in the NBA finals for me,
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.560]   and then I got blocked, eventually.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.440]   Anyways, I booked tennis courts in San Francisco,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.440]   'cause Lord knows that is hard enough to do already.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.740]   So I think that's a great agent use case.
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.220]   Agent that acts for me,
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.800]   automates some of the tedious parts of my life,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.660]   things that I want to do.
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.500]   However, that does beg the question,
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.060]   how do you control what they're allowed to do?
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.640]   - Yeah, and we're moving so fast with all of this
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.740]   and having fun getting it to do things.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.620]   You know, GitHub MCP is one of my favorites,
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.280]   because I can just get it going and have it read reviews for me,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.840]   read diffs for me, and just help me manage GitHub,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.760]   which is really awesome, but it's very developer-centric,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.300]   obviously, it's GitHub, but MCPs in general,
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.120]   like, you have to go and edit this JSON file and do that,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.260]   and it's really tough to, like, I have to give it a pat,
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.560]   and, you know, that's an advanced use case for non-developers.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.940]   And so we really need a way to let these tools act on our behalf,
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.440]   but in a more traditional way that's easy for end users
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.660]   to be able to set that up.
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.140]   And so, yeah, that's what we do at WorkOS.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.120]   We do, like, authorization and user management,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.280]   and, like, the main point of this talk is to really help drive the idea
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.080]   that we need, like, the same kind of credentials and authorization
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.220]   that we do with user-facing projects.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.900]   We need the agents to do that as well as a start,
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.320]   and then we have a lot of places that we can go with this
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.500]   as we get more fine-grained.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.560]   But really, the point is that OAuth really just isn't for humans
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.860]   anymore.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.140]   It's for our agents acting on our behalf.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.300]   And you know what else agents need?
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.680]   Memory, persistent storage.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.760]   Anyone here use Cloudflare?
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.560]   You think you know what Cloudflare does?
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.180]   No.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.600]   I'm here to tell you that you do not.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.720]   People are like, oh, you do security, CDN,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.880]   DDoS protection, bot management.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.240]   We do so much more.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.720]   We have compute Cloudflare workers.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.300]   We can host your code on the edge.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.580]   We host AI models you can run imprints on.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.640]   Vectorize, we have a vector database, a SQL database.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.680]   Durable objects, which is what we use in our agent's framework
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.300]   to maintain memory.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.020]   Very important.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.760]   And video streaming, image optimization, so much more.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.340]   If you use Cloudflare workers, we have bindings.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.300]   Bindings let you interact from your web app, from your website,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.720]   from your agent as well.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.980]   Because our agents and MCB servers are kind of similar in that you
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.280]   can use bindings to interact with other Cloudflare products.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.400]   And also just like, of course, you can use other companies' products
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.940]   as well.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.600]   And of course, now we have a free tier.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.860]   Durable objects used to not be free.
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.800]   Now you can use it.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.380]   And I know startups who use Cloudflare who do not pay us.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.380]   And they make money.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.380]   Yeah, I digress.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.560]   But yeah, all of these pieces, they really help to--
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.960]   they just bent naturally into building these agents.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.380]   Because they'll deliver the code to where you're at.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.380]   And you can use the durable objects to store persistence on them.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.660]   And you can also use things like authorization
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.200]   to make sure-- and there's a whole OAuth framework
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.820]   with Cloudflare's agents framework that lets you set up
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.520]   that authorization so that you can easily know who the worker is--
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.280]   or the agent is acting on behalf of.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.520]   So--
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.280]   And this agenda will be made available at the end
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.640]   in the GitHub repo.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.700]   It's a markdown file.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.140]   So we did build an MCP server using Cloudflare
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.600]   and using WorkOS.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.520]   And it's just a very basic one.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.380]   You'll be able to check it out.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.780]   And you can use it and run it today, which is really awesome.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.560]   And we're just going to deploy it real quick.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.920]   So I'll just do npm run deploy, which
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.240]   will run Wrangler to deploy that.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.140]   And as soon as it's out there, we'll
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.140]   be able to see it in my compute here.
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.200]   Oops, I was just there.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.660]   That's the Cloudflare dashboard.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.400]   And it's also very easily to run locally as well,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.980]   with like npm run or Wrangler run, something similar.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.860]   So a few seconds ago, we've got it deployed.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.960]   And going back to the terminal, it gave me a URL here.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.220]   And so I can just copy my worker's URL.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.980]   And I'm going to go over to my client, Claude.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.040]   And I'm just going to hit this button and say Add Integration.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   And it's going to pop up.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.220]   I'll make this big.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.540]   And I can go Add Integration.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.540]   And I'll just say, I want to add mcp.shop.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.880]   Ho, ho, ho, what could it be?
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.560]   Naming things is hard.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.600]   I'm just tacking on it, slash mcp onto there.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.860]   And now I've got mcp.shop.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.500]   And I'm going to connect.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.640]   And so once I connect, this is pulling up
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.440]   and allowing me to tell the agent who to act on behalf of--
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.920]   me, in this case.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.960]   So I'm going to sign in with GitHub.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.880]   It's going to do its thing.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.580]   And then Claude is refreshed.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.900]   And now it can act on behalf of me.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.160]   And can we see the tools?
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.720]   So what should we ask?
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.000]   Let's order a shirt.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.080]   Let's order a shirt.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.800]   I love shirts.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.380]   Yo, I hear I can get a shirt.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.120]   Get a shirt from you.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.860]   Live demos in an LLM.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.020]   Wi-Fi don't fail us.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.240]   So it's running.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.780]   And it recognized that it has tools available now
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.580]   from mcp.shop.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.480]   So it's going to list the inventory.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.360]   We'll go ahead and let it run.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.400]   Yeah, there's an MCP shirt.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.360]   You can get it for free.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.740]   And you can pick your size.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.040]   And then all it needs is just your company name and your mailing
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.000]   address.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.960]   And so I'll say, give me--
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.120]   I'll say, XL and 123 Main Street.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.080]   Bellevue, Nebraska.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.040]   There's a Bellevue, Nebraska.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.100]   And we'll do that.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:15.740]   Oh, it needs my company name.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.500]   That's so LinkedIn.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.000]   Duh.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.300]   Might be my company name is WorkOS Duh now.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.800]   So we'll let that run.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:38.300]   I'm not sure thinking about it.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.560]   It's confirmed it.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.180]   Done.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.300]   And there's my order number.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.880]   It's going to be sent to that address.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.920]   And I'm going to say, ooh, what is the order info?
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.540]   So I can see what--
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.100]   is my name or my company name WorkOS Duh?
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.560]   I kind of hope it is.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.060]   Human in the loop.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.240]   Need to confirm.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.360]   No, I got it.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.860]   Ah.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.680]   Right.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.160]   That was totally me, not Claude.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.640]   So yeah, I was able to order a shirt.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.240]   And you can as well.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.080]   But that's just a piece of it.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.100]   So when we ran this, it's going into--
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.760]   close that.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.740]   If we go into my Cloudflare platform here and go
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.200]   to storage, KV, I've got an orders here.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.620]   This is key value storage.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.740]   Yep.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.360]   And there is the data from the order.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.920]   So now I've got that saved off.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.340]   I can use that.
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.740]   And it was all through that interface.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.940]   So we really just gave Claude the tools that it needed.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.980]   And it was able to act on my behalf.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.620]   And I can go back in and I can say, can you tell me
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.000]   what you know about me?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.760]   So we've got to get user info.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.040]   And this is really just going to give me mostly
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.100]   the Jot information.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.520]   What's on my JWT that Claude now knows about me.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.260]   So it knows my name.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.560]   It knows my email address.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.780]   In my Jot, I have my favorite song in there, "Careless Whisperer."
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.600]   Now I will give you a rendition.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.140]   And so from there, it also knows that I have admin permissions.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:32.620]   So I have SHA admin access because that's in my roles and permissions.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:39.520]   The other cool thing that you can do with the CloudFuller piece of it, and because your MCP
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:46.360]   server is a durable object, you can also store data directly on that that's located on that.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.620]   You want to explain that?
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.360]   So durable objects, tough name.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.100]   If you search Twitter, people tweet about how they're like, "This is a bad name.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.100]   Change the name."
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.160]   But very fast storage.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.780]   You can spin them up per user.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.580]   They're close to the user as well for faster retrieval and storage.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:10.540]   So what I did is I just asked it to change the demo mode to band.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:21.540]   And that ran a tool in the MCP server itself that is just going in, and on the context that's
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.100]   associated with this worker object, it's just changing the mode to band.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:32.320]   And so now I've got that, and now I can say, "I want another shirt, please."
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.380]   And it's going to try and run it.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.020]   I'll just always allow that now.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.880]   And it was able to check that, and it said, "Absolutely not.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   Go away."
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.600]   Wave.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.620]   And so we can mix what it knows about me with what it has stored about me on the durable
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.680]   object, and that's unique for every user of it.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.220]   And then I can do things like change it again.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:09.280]   So if I say, "Pretty please," it might have a "pretty please" tool available.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:16.340]   If you want to build your own MCP servers on cloud players, it's going to let me.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.340]   And I just ordered another shirt.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:25.240]   If you want to build your own MCP servers on cloud player, you can click to deploy your own with
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.400]   no authorization, so it's authless.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.460]   authless.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:34.460]   So probably don't do that, but it is very quick to do so.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:41.520]   You click, "Click to deploy," it generates a GitHub repo for you, you get clone that, and then
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   you edit your own tools.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:50.580]   you get clone that, and they give you some tools to begin with, so it's very fast.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:59.640]   But again, that is authless.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.700]   do, do, do, auth.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.700]   And it's still quick to deploy as well with auth, just slightly less fast.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   And the beauty of this is that we're bringing the pretty simple tools.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.360]   This is just a no auth flow being added to an MCP, and MCP is effectively just an API.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.620]   So we're just getting it caught up with the tools that we already have for humans, but it's
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:31.100]   important to get this ready to go for these tools to act on our behalf as well.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.120]   And where we can see this going in the future is much more fine-grained authorization, where
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.680]   it's maybe authorizing per-line changes, or per-tool changes, or even maybe authorizing
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.800]   the networks, the connections between things, and just doing...
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.420]   As we see it growing to doing thousands of tasks on our behalf, this auth piece is going
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.020]   to be very important, and especially the audit trail as well.
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:02.220]   And we can get that with auth tools too, just to make sure that we can see why this interacted
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.300]   this way, on whose behalf was it on, and what was the end result?
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   Where did it fail?
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.660]   Where did it go wrong?
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.660]   Things like that.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.980]   Think of your users not as users, but as deputies.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:17.520]   They have access to tools, and they can use and also misuse them as well.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.540]   Sometimes I think I trust people.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:25.120]   Like I do a live demo, and I'm like, "Let's see user input."
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.740]   People sometimes do not nice inputs.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.740]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.860]   So get out there and deputize your own tools.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.240]   We have this repo available.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.500]   There is the code, a QR code, for this repo.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.820]   Also the top QR code is to get...
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.820]   Get your own shirt.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.820]   A shirt?
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.060]   Or you can just go to mcp.shop, which you'll run the same workflow that I just ran.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.460]   It doesn't have the Pretty Please tool in it though, unfortunately.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.460]   It'll just do it, even if you're mean to it.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.220]   But you can order a shirt for the low, low price of $0.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.800]   So go check it out and get an MCP t-shirt.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:05.020]   And if you want to add your own Pretty Please tool, check out the code in the second QR code.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.860]   And we can't wait to see what MCP servers you build with auth.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.860]   Thank you.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.860]   Thank you.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.860]   Thank you for listening.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:11.860]   Thank you.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:11.860]   Thank you.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.860]   Thank you.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.300]   We'll see you next time.
