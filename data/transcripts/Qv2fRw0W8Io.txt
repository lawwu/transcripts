[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.100]   - First use case I thought about this,
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.720]   that an average person might be preparing for an interview
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.280]   is in a job setting, right?
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.000]   I'm looking for a job, I'm going in.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   I know at some point someone's gonna say,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.560]   "All right, what questions do you have for me?"
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.880]   You know, my initial advice after reading your book was,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.040]   well, you should try to get to that point at the end
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.880]   with never having, you know,
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.040]   you have such a good conversation
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.520]   that you don't even leave time for the questions.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.800]   How would you advise someone thinking about
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.080]   that kind of professional setting
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.640]   where they have time to prepare?
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.000]   - Okay, let me give you one.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.400]   What questions do you have for me?
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400]   The natural next step might be to say,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.760]   how many hours do we work here, right?
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.840]   Now you're coming across as a needy person
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.720]   trying to understand, it makes you,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.600]   it's hard for me to say this,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.200]   but if you keep asking questions,
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080]   you come across as an inferior.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.680]   Versus saying, now tell me about the hours at work here.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.160]   Talk a little bit about what's expected from us
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.560]   in our off hours.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.880]   Talk a little bit about how we connect
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.640]   to each other in the company instead of,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.280]   so how do we connect to each other?
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.840]   So what you're doing, and this is one example,
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.360]   is directing the person.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.040]   Directing gives them the confidence that you can lead them,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.040]   that you could lead them through the conversation
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.320]   and also that you can lead at the job.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.160]   And so that's a good example of me saying,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.120]   shouldn't be a question.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.400]   Sometimes you just need to make a statement, take control.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.200]   In my book, "Stop Asking Questions,"
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.760]   I gave the example of how Olivia and my wife and my family
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.040]   went on these tours of national parks.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.360]   And if we would ever have a tour guide
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.520]   who would walk around and go,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.000]   do you wanna turn right or left?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.880]   What do you like to see?
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.600]   Do you like to see this track or that?
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.840]   And it's too much.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.000]   You're the expert.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.360]   Say, and now we're gonna turn left
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.440]   because when we turn left,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   you're gonna see what the bears have done here.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.400]   And if we turn right after that,
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.560]   you're gonna see what's happened
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.600]   because we haven't had enough water here in California.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.440]   Boom, now you got somebody who knows you,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.320]   who you feel confident that they could lead you.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.080]   That's the way you need to be as an interviewer,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.320]   as a conversationalist.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.400]   And yes, like you said,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.960]   somebody is about to get a job and they're being asked,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.400]   do you have any questions for me?
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.640]   You don't have to specifically give a question.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.120]   Start directing them.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.200]   - So if you're not asking as many questions,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.400]   talk about how someone should prepare
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.040]   for kind of conversations when they have advanced notice
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.240]   of who they're talking about in the topic.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.680]   - The best thing is to go deep.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.160]   This is gonna be a little bit woo.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.240]   Go deep in your heart and say,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.160]   what the hell do I need to get out of this person?
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.960]   What do I need to get out of this conversation?
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.160]   Not, what does some imaginary audience member need to know
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.520]   and I need to get?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.800]   We don't need that imaginary audience member anymore.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.960]   It's, I have a problem.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040]   What do I want to understand from this person
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.320]   that I can't get from anywhere else?
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.400]   Go deep and say, ah, that's the thing that I need.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.240]   That's the thing that I need.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.640]   And if it's for your audience,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.480]   the only way I think to get to your audience
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.920]   is to have a drink with your audience members
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.640]   or a meal or dinner with a few of them.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.960]   One at a time, ideally.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.080]   In small groups, if you can, do one at a time
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.840]   and as often as you can
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.720]   and then have them tell you their problems.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.840]   Let them find ways to get it out.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.200]   Have them tell you their problems
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.680]   and specifically the ones you can't answer.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.240]   Feel that pain of having somebody come to you
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.520]   as the expert interviewer or as the expert business person,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.080]   as the expert whatever.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.240]   And they're asking you a question
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.080]   you don't have the answer.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.680]   And then you say, be humble.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.760]   I'm gonna do interviews and now I'm gonna find out.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.920]   And now when you ask that question of somebody else,
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.360]   you're gonna have a deep need to get the answer
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   because you couldn't answer it.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.400]   Because somebody you cared about
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.320]   who you had a meal with or a drink with
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.760]   asked you a question that you can't answer.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.160]   That's where it comes from.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.760]   And so the first thing to do is not to do research.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.840]   And I believe in doing research and I know you do too.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.240]   The first thing to do is not to write out a list of questions
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.640]   and a lot of interviewers do that.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.840]   We don't wanna do that.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.360]   The first thing is to say, what do I need?
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.480]   - I just thought of an idea of what you just said,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.440]   which is, let's say I'm using this job interview example,
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.160]   but start asking, talking to your friend,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.000]   talking to your spouse,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.920]   talking to your family members about this job you're getting
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.720]   and see which questions that they have for you
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.920]   about the company that you can't answer
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.320]   and you wish you knew as a way to kind of generate ideas
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.760]   of what could be interesting.
