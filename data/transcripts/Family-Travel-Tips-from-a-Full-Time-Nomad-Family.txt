[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.920]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.420]   Today on the show, I wanna share with you
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.580]   a somewhat chatty analysis of family travel.
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.340]   I'm gonna share with you some of the things
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.440]   that we are doing right now on our global adventures,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.380]   and share some lessons that I have learned
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.760]   in hopes that these lessons may be useful
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.040]   to you in the future.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.520]   I think of myself and see myself
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.080]   as something of a human guinea pig.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.040]   I really enjoy trying new things,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.360]   trying weird things, experiencing things myself
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.920]   so that I can understand how they work,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.080]   understand what it's like to go through them,
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.840]   and then share those experiences with others.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.000]   And so you can just think of me as your human guinea pig,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.840]   somebody who's going through the hard work
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.560]   of doing what we're doing,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.520]   which is quite simply living as a nomadic family,
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.160]   or a family of six.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.000]   My eldest child is seven.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.920]   My youngest child is two.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.080]   So we have four young children
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.000]   with whom we are traveling the world at the moment.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.800]   We are currently in Europe.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.200]   We've been on the road for a couple of months now.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.080]   I'd have to go back and check the exact dates,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.060]   but we've been on the road for a couple of months now.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.520]   And at this point in time, I have learned enough,
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.940]   and I've proven even just some of my own things,
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.200]   finding some things that are working,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.680]   some things that are not working.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.240]   And I just wanna share some of those lessons with you.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240]   So if that kind of thing sounds interesting to you,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.960]   then stay tuned.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.040]   So to begin with, we are now currently in Europe.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.180]   As I record this, we have just recently arrived here
[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.520]   on the beautiful Mediterranean island of Malta.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.320]   And Malta is a very interesting place.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.200]   I'll come back to that in a, perhaps in future discussions.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.460]   I think that little islands are very interesting places.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.000]   And what's unique about little islands
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.480]   is they often have to fight to survive.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.240]   If you consider the benefits that you get
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.500]   having a large landmass,
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.480]   some of the things that you have from that,
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.160]   and then realize what you would lose
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.080]   if that were taken away,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.040]   you kind of have the situation
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520]   that a lot of little islands have.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.480]   All around the world, there are small island nations
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.440]   that are distinct nations, distinct peoples,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.140]   but they don't have the resources
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.080]   that some larger, more powerful nations have.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.660]   They don't have the number of residents.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.160]   They don't have easy access to resources.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.520]   They don't have easy transportation.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.640]   A lot of times they're somewhat isolated
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.240]   and then they have to figure out how do we make it?
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.520]   And especially in a modern economy,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.360]   where it's very rare to find anybody
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.920]   who actually lives in a sustainable,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   kind of just local closed cycle, closed circle economy,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.300]   these islands have to figure out
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.160]   what is our place in the world.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.860]   In the coming years, I would like to visit
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.660]   as many of these little islands as I can
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.340]   to make sure that I understand
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.220]   what their place in the world is,
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.180]   because in the financial system,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.860]   these little islands are very important.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.420]   One of the ways that islands have found
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.340]   to build and boost their local economy
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.880]   is through financial services.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.780]   That's often where you get,
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.100]   if you think of the various tax havens
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.580]   and offshore banking locations and business jurisdictions,
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.540]   you'll often find them situated on small little islands.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.460]   And because those islands have found out
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.380]   that they can serve effectively in the financial system.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.980]   And various of these islands have different specialties
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.660]   on which they compete.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.240]   You'll often find that islands function as tax havens,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.500]   even if they're islands that are part of larger nations.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.980]   So for example, Madeira functions as kind of a tax haven,
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.660]   but part of Portugal.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.660]   You have, what is it, Langkawi Island in Malaysia
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.380]   that functions as a tax, no, Labuan,
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.200]   which is an island that is, or a small part of Malaysia
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.540]   that functions as the Malaysian tax haven.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.660]   You'll see this with many of the Caribbean islands
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.980]   that function in the financial system.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.120]   They're known for offshore services,
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.100]   they're known for banking,
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.900]   they're known for being tax-friendly jurisdictions.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.900]   There's a reason why cruise ships
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.060]   are registered in the Bahamas, right?
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.140]   If you look at the large cruise ships around the world
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.380]   and see where they're registered on the back,
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.420]   it'll usually be a small island nation.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.500]   Many people's yachts, you walk through a marina
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.460]   with large ocean-going vessels,
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.260]   and you'll see that many of those nations are registered,
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.180]   many of those vessels are registered on a small island.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.320]   In the asset protection space, in estate planning space,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.280]   you have jurisdictions like the Cook Islands,
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.160]   which is overseen by New Zealand.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.680]   The Cook Islands is, sorry,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.840]   it's a protectorate of New Zealand,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.240]   I think would be the precise term.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.540]   The Cook Islands is a very important space
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.480]   in the asset protection planning marketplace.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.800]   And so these islands fascinate me,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.280]   and Malta is one of those islands.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.560]   And so I've come here to check it out
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.920]   and get a sense of what it is.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.440]   And it's also an extremely attractive
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.360]   vacation destination, beautiful waters,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.760]   ancient architecture.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.520]   It's fascinating to see how Malta has been colonialized
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.560]   by practically everyone out in existence.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.720]   The Ottoman Empire, the Turks,
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.760]   attacked Malta quite famously in the 1500s.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.560]   Malta has been ruled by the Arabs,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.920]   it's been ruled by the British,
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.600]   it's been ruled by everybody,
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.760]   it's just because it's a strategic island
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   right in the middle of the Mediterranean.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.160]   So it's just a very interesting place.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.840]   But we'll get into Malta,
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.800]   so maybe some point in the future.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.160]   Malta has lots of connections to radical personal finance.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.800]   They've been trying to build themselves
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.500]   as blockchain island.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.960]   It was more promising a few years ago
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.840]   than it has been recently.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.520]   There's been some recent troubles with that adventure,
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.280]   but who knows, we'll see what happens in the future.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.160]   Malta famously sells citizenships,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.800]   European citizenships,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.120]   for people who want to quickly become an EU citizen
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.600]   and who have maybe a million dollars
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.560]   that they're willing to invest into the Maltese economy
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.600]   without getting it back,
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.400]   then they can do business with the Maltese government
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.640]   and potentially purchase Maltese citizenship
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.360]   for themselves and their family members,
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.800]   which can give them access to Malta specifically
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.600]   and to the European Union.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.080]   Malta's an interesting tax haven in the European Union.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.480]   For Maltese residents,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.640]   people who set up residency in Malta,
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.320]   it can be quite an attractive and interesting place to live,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.280]   helps people to save substantially on their taxes.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.800]   There's a couple of different ways that you can use Malta,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.880]   but it has all the benefits of being inside
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.360]   of the European Union.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.680]   And so I'm just here checking it out,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.780]   and that's kind of where we started our European adventure.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.040]   Now, let's talk about travel more specifically.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.680]   The first thing I'll address is simply the doability
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   and the difficulty of traveling in an age of COVID,
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.480]   because it has been a real mixture of those two things.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.560]   First, you'll have to settle for yourself
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.840]   the advisability of traveling
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.640]   in the middle of this current coronavirus pandemic.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.000]   For myself and for my family,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.360]   during the beginning of the pandemic,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.320]   we were quite stationary,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.040]   taking all of the appropriate precautions, et cetera,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   just like I think most thoughtful people were seeking to do.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.840]   But along the way, as the evidence came out
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.400]   that coronavirus wasn't the deadly pandemic
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.680]   that I had feared,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.640]   then we went ahead and loosened up
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.400]   and started traveling a good bit more.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.120]   And so we've traveled a good bit even through the pandemic.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.840]   But one of the things that I have tried to do
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.360]   is I have tried to choose destinations
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.280]   where travel was a little bit more doable,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.520]   and I have tried to choose destinations
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.320]   that were a bit more livable in case we got stuck there.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   And so in the first few countries of our global tour,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.880]   I tried to choose countries
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.000]   that would be simple to travel to,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.120]   would be easy for us to travel to for various reasons,
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.080]   and countries that would be simple
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.480]   to deal with the COVID restrictions.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.080]   The first country on our global tour for us was Mexico.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.880]   And one of the nice things about Mexico
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.920]   is simply that Mexico, to my knowledge,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.920]   never imposed entry restrictions
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.400]   due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is quite unique.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.360]   Most countries around the world
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.920]   have at some point imposed entry restrictions,
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.880]   but in my memory,
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.080]   I don't believe that Mexico
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.640]   ever imposed entrance restrictions.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.840]   And so when we went to Mexico,
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.880]   there were no requirements to demonstrate vaccination,
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.200]   there were no requirements to have negative COVID tests,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.040]   et cetera.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.360]   And so that was our first destination.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.040]   We chose Mexico also
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.080]   because it was a fairly easy place for us to travel.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.720]   I speak Spanish,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.520]   I'm familiar and very comfortable in Latin America,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.600]   and so it was a fairly simple place to be.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.560]   After Mexico, we traveled to Costa Rica,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   and Costa Rica also has an interesting story.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.080]   Costa Rica is a country that did indeed close its borders
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.480]   quite severely for several months during the pandemic.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.320]   But then they eventually opened their borders,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.400]   and what Costa Rica did
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.200]   was they didn't impose a requirement after a while
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.240]   when we went there.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.680]   They didn't impose any requirements for testing upon entry.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.680]   You didn't have to demonstrate negative COVID tests,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.640]   there are no vaccination requirements to enter Costa Rica.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.040]   What they did require you to do
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.080]   was of course to fill out a health locator form,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.840]   which is standard practice for everyone at this point,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.680]   and also to demonstrate
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.240]   that you have appropriate health insurance,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.760]   so that if you did wind up becoming sick
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.600]   with the coronavirus or any other sickness,
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.940]   that you would have appropriate health insurance
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.480]   that would cover your medical expenses
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.920]   and not put a strain
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.400]   upon their nationalized health insurance program.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.800]   Following Costa Rica, we then traveled to the United States,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.360]   and I spent three weeks in the United States,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   visiting family.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.660]   We had a family reunion with our various family members,
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.760]   which was wonderful, enjoying the holidays.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.680]   One of the lessons that I have learned
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.600]   from being abroad over the last few years
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.380]   is I miss holidays.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.440]   I really do, I really miss holidays.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.960]   And I think that those are some of those things.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.440]   I'm a fairly sentimental person,
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.240]   and I learned that I don't miss home, so to speak,
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.620]   most of the time.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.220]   Most of the time, I don't miss being in the United States,
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.720]   being in Florida, but I do miss it at the holidays.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   Going 4th of July or Independence Day
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.560]   just isn't quite the same
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.920]   when you're not in the United States.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.760]   And I've never really been,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.320]   I'm not an intensely nationalistic person,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.000]   but still, you can't help but just feel
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.560]   that sense of unity and nationalism
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.120]   when you're part of a major holiday
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.940]   like the 4th of July.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.940]   Back in 2018, my family and I, for the 4th of July,
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.040]   were in this incredible little town
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   in the middle of Kansas called Wamego, or Wamega,
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.560]   I think it's Wamego, Kansas,
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.800]   right in the middle of Kansas.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.640]   And it was a wonderful experience
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.600]   because it was the quintessential, stereotypical
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.040]   U.S.-American Independence Day celebration.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.620]   We were with some friends.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.180]   We had a nice barbecue during the day.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.520]   We hung out in the pool.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   Then there's just this wonderful small-town parade
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.000]   that's been going on for, I don't know,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.680]   176 years, something like that,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.560]   continually every single year.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.600]   And I was so fun to be able to take my young children
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.480]   to that, and they loved the parade.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.320]   They loved the horses.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.360]   They loved all of that quintessential Americana experience.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.960]   It was phenomenal.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.520]   But then the next year, we were gone.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.760]   I missed it so much.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.600]   I missed not being in the United States
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.360]   for Independence Day.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.080]   And so it was so nice this year
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.240]   to be back in the United States on Independence Day
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.140]   to be able to enjoy that.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.880]   For Independence Day, we were in the Florida Keys,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.480]   hanging out on the boat,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.880]   looking at the fireworks out on the water,
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.440]   and that was really nice as well.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.080]   The Florida Keys is a special place,
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.320]   and it's an interesting place to be on the 4th of July.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   So we really, really enjoyed that.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.880]   Going back into the United States, though,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.720]   is certainly quite shocking
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.560]   because across at least most of the United States
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.200]   at this point, it feels very much like the pandemic
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.840]   is kind of a thing of the past.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.880]   It was quite shocking after being used to being required
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.200]   to wear a mask everywhere.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.600]   When we were in Costa Rica, for example,
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.640]   it was very, very tight coronavirus restrictions.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.120]   You wouldn't even dream of going maskless somewhere.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.240]   You wouldn't dream of standing closer
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.840]   than two meters to somebody.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.400]   And so to go from that back into the United States
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.400]   where virtually no face masks and everything is wide open,
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.080]   it really, it was a great experience,
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.480]   and it was just really nice to be back there.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.860]   I did seriously consider just simply staying
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.160]   in the United States.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.080]   I've thought a lot about how the United States
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.880]   has handled the coronavirus pandemic
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.880]   as compared to other countries.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.060]   On the one hand, the death toll in the United States
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.760]   is exceedingly high,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.040]   especially as compared to some other places.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.720]   Now, of course, when you adjust per capita basis,
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.400]   it adjusts and there can be many reasons for that.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.960]   But on the one hand, you could say,
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.120]   "Oh, the death toll is exceedingly high."
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.200]   On the other hand, the United States
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   has got into the pandemic faster than anyone else
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.640]   and got out of the pandemic faster
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.720]   than anywhere else in the world.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.040]   And that's the real power of the United States,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.760]   I think, in my opinion.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.520]   There's an old quote, I have no idea
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.480]   who I could possibly attribute it to,
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.760]   but something like, "The Americans will always do
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.840]   the right thing after they've exhausted every other option."
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.600]   And you can always count on the Americans
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.320]   to do the right thing after they've exhausted
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.440]   every other option.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.960]   But then when they do it,
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.940]   there's just something about our American culture,
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.760]   where we just get into it, right?
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.080]   We roll up our sleeves and make it happen.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.600]   And you see that, that's fundamentally a part
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.760]   of the can-do spirit that infuses
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.840]   the United States of America.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.600]   And you saw that with Operation Warp Speed
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.800]   in the pandemic, the development of the vaccine.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.360]   You see that in terms of just the culture
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.280]   is wired for action.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.320]   And it's very, very hard to corral Americans.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.560]   It's very, very hard to get them
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.080]   to move in the same direction.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.000]   We fight like crazy people among ourselves,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.920]   but then when there is something that needs to be done,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.440]   it's pretty remarkable to see.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.200]   And so being back in the United States
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.800]   after quite a long time being abroad,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.120]   it was just such an amazing culture shock,
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.840]   such an amazing sense of culture shock for me to say,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   "Wow, this is, look at this, like we've moved on,
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.360]   we're done with this whole thing."
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.160]   And so that's been a remarkable experience.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.060]   So I won't linger too much on the United States,
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.920]   but I do wanna point out that one of the things
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.720]   that I have been conscious of is,
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.840]   okay, if I get stuck somewhere again, right?
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.420]   Whether it's the Delta variant or the whatever,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.720]   the gamma and the epsilon ends up being,
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.920]   if I get stuck somewhere again,
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.240]   if the world shuts down again,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.080]   which I think is unlikely at this point in time,
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.560]   where do I wanna be?
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.480]   And while for a time I thought, you know what?
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.520]   I'm quite glad to have not been in the United States
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.160]   during the pandemic.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.520]   This point in time, I honestly said to myself,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.300]   "I think this is where I'd wanna be going forward."
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.660]   Because it's been tough, obviously all around the world,
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.120]   but dealing with the lockdowns and all of the curfews
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.960]   and confinements, all of this stuff,
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.880]   and just all the restrictions,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.840]   there's been a number of countries
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.520]   where it's become quite evident to me
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.280]   that I don't ever wanna be stuck
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.960]   in this particular country.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.480]   I don't wanna be stuck there.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.480]   But then there've been a number where I say,
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.440]   "Okay, that would be a place that I would like to be."
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.480]   And so at this point in time,
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.920]   while I don't intend to hop on an airplane
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.960]   and head back to the United States,
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   I do think that it's important to acknowledge
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.800]   that the US is more livable today
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.680]   than virtually any place that I have been
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.800]   in the last six months,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.120]   at least with regard to the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.400]   And that's a neat, just it's important to acknowledge that.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.720]   We left the United States on July 5,
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.280]   heading to Europe.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.680]   And here is where kind of the dance
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.520]   of travel during COVID has taken place.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.360]   The dance has been quite challenging.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   Now we worked into it,
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.560]   which is a strategy that I recommend, right?
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.620]   When you're gonna do something,
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.080]   start with something that's not too difficult,
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.060]   start with something that's easy enough to start
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.240]   and then move into it.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.880]   So we didn't start with trying to go to Europe
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.840]   with our travels.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.340]   I wanted to travel in some places
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.040]   that were gonna be fairly simple, mostly low cost.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.360]   I wanted to go to the United States for the holidays.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.000]   I wanted to be able to be there to adjust baggage
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.920]   and get cheap stuff if we needed to get cheap stuff
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.680]   to change how we were packing.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.960]   But then I wanted to go to Europe
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.220]   and I was hoping to be here sooner,
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.760]   but this is the way it worked out.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.960]   I wanted to spend the summer in Europe this summer.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.720]   And my major goal, number one,
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.000]   is to spend some time in France
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.160]   or a French-speaking region of Switzerland,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.280]   Belgium, et cetera.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.080]   But probably in France.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.880]   I have, over the last year or so,
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.520]   worked hard to improve my own French
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.100]   and I've started teaching my children French this year.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.160]   It's not been as successful as I had hoped
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.440]   at the beginning of the year.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.840]   And so I wanted just a chance to reinvigorate
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.640]   that project for myself,
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.720]   reinvigorate that project for my children.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.560]   And I thought it would be neat
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.240]   to just spend some time in France.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.480]   And there are many portions, places in France
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.720]   that are just dreamy locations, right?
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.080]   South of France is truly an amazing place.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.280]   The French Riviera, truly a remarkable place.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.320]   And I really enjoy so many aspects of the French culture.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.840]   And so I thought it would be really fun
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.060]   to be in France for the summer.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.000]   But first we had to get into Europe.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.340]   And as I was studying the situation,
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.560]   trying to figure out how do I take advantage
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.320]   of the airfare situation,
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.680]   but also consider how we could work
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.720]   around the COVID restrictions, it was quite challenging.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.000]   Back in the early part of the year,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.080]   I think it was February, I went ahead and bought tickets.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.520]   I bought tickets to Europe.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.840]   And at the time, Europe was completely closed to tourists.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.680]   Certainly, of course, European nationals
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.720]   could get into Europe,
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.280]   but it was completely closed to tourists.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.880]   And so I didn't know when, of course we're Americans,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.240]   and so I didn't know when are they gonna let us back in.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.680]   And at the time, the United States of America
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.200]   was on all the red lists,
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.440]   all the blocked lists from around the world.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.080]   And so I thought, well, what do I do?
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.880]   Right now is the best time ever to buy tickets,
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.360]   airplane tickets, because things were crazy, crazy cheap,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.540]   but am I gonna be able to get in or not?
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.920]   So finally I decided I've got to pull the trigger,
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.080]   I've gotta do it.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.680]   And so I was shopping around,
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.940]   I've become quite good at getting discounted airfares,
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.440]   because that's one of the biggest expenses
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.040]   that we face when traveling.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.960]   And so I pulled the trigger on some tickets,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.720]   and I was able to get tickets from Miami, Florida,
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   to Lisbon, Portugal for $165 one way on Air France,
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.240]   which was, I considered a phenomenal deal.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.800]   Frequently, your tickets to Europe,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.040]   especially in the summertime from the United States,
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.600]   are $700 and $900 from the East Coast.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.800]   You feel really good about yourself
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.480]   if you can get a round trip ticket for 500.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   And so when I got my one way tickets for 165,
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.400]   I just felt, I was so proud of myself.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   I felt, this will be great.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.760]   But it was a giant risk,
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.440]   because I didn't know am I even gonna be able to get in.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.680]   The airline softened a lot of the restrictions
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.780]   on date changes, change fees, et cetera, which was great.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.040]   But at the end of the day,
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.900]   I didn't have any guarantee of that.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.780]   So I bought those tickets back in February,
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.480]   trying to just chart out what I could imagine.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.120]   I could not imagine that Europe was going to be able
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.640]   to stay closed for another summer.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.640]   And this has been my observations,
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.280]   is that how can these places
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.480]   that depend so heavily on tourism,
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.200]   how can they stay closed to tourists
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.520]   for two seasons in a row?
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.720]   Europe lost the tourist season of last summer,
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.920]   and then to lose it a second season,
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.960]   I just thought, you know what,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.000]   there's gonna be a lot of pressure.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.360]   So the tickets were cheap enough
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.920]   that if I just wound up with a voucher
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.000]   or if I lost the money, no big deal.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.040]   I didn't make any other arrangements for accommodations,
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.760]   'cause I figured that would be easy, but I did buy airfare.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.000]   And the lesson there, I would just say is,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.560]   the thing that I have learned is,
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.640]   one of the best things about not being broke
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.200]   is you can take advantage of opportunities
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.720]   when they present themselves to you.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.160]   I've been broke a good portion of my life,
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.080]   and I hated it, because I would find opportunities
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.400]   to buy something, get a really good deal,
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.880]   and I just didn't have the money to pull the trigger.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.920]   I didn't have the money to make it happen.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.960]   And I realized that one of the first reasons
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.600]   why you should build up cash reserves,
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.560]   just money that's yours, money to spend,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.080]   is so you can take advantage
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.900]   of discounted buying opportunities.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.840]   Because the guy who's got money
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.240]   can always take advantage of a buying opportunity,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.400]   and the guy who doesn't can't.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.100]   Now, this begins, you've heard me talk, for example,
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.680]   about bulk buying, right?
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.720]   It's just kind of the boilerplate language that I use
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.120]   to say, if you drink a Pepsi every day,
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.640]   and you're buying your Pepsi at the convenience store,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.440]   you're getting ripped off, right?
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.880]   You go buy your Pepsi from the big box warehouse store
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.440]   and get it for a lot cheaper.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.200]   Well, in order to do that, you gotta have the money
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.040]   enough to buy 24 of them at a time
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.520]   instead of just one of them at a time.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.640]   And so people who are poor often get stuck in this cycle
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.440]   where they're paying the highest per unit cost
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.040]   for the things that they're buying
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.720]   because they don't have any more money
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.760]   to be able to buy something more.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.000]   And so one of the things that you can do
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.440]   is move yourself from the perspective of buying things daily
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.800]   to buying things weekly, monthly, et cetera.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.560]   Now, most of my listening audience
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.840]   has never bought things daily,
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.440]   but at least half of the world's population,
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.560]   or maybe that's too much,
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.960]   but a lot of the world's population lives daily, right?
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.520]   They earn daily, they earn today's wages,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.840]   and then they spend daily.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.240]   They earn the money today for the food
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.040]   that they're going to feed their family tonight,
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.560]   quite literally.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.600]   And so to get out of that cycle of poverty,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.000]   you've gotta get a little bit of money behind you.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.780]   And so whether it's daily wages and daily expenses,
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.180]   whether it's weekly, monthly, et cetera,
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.140]   you gotta get a little bit of money behind you.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.400]   But then once you get more and more money behind you,
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.720]   things become easier and easier
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.920]   because then you can apply that same principle
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.360]   to bigger purchases.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.640]   Whenever somebody is selling something,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.160]   if it's a good deal, you can just buy it.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.080]   For example, one of the rules that I have for myself
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.680]   is if I ever know of anybody who is selling a car,
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.400]   somebody that I know,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   I will always go and look at it
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.760]   and possibly make them an offer.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.780]   And here's my strategy.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.420]   It's very simple.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.020]   Cars are generally some of the bigger purchases
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:56.860]   that we make.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.620]   They're some of the more expensive things that we buy.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.580]   Now, of course, if you like to buy new cars
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.180]   and you swap out your cars every few years,
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.500]   there are other strategies that we could employ there.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.980]   I prefer to buy used cars when possible.
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.740]   I've never bought a new car, so let me just rephrase that.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.060]   I prefer to buy used cars,
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.700]   at least at this point in my life,
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.940]   primarily because I don't want to destroy
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.820]   whatever new car we might buy.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.260]   Maybe at some point I'll buy a new car,
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.820]   but I prefer to buy used cars.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.340]   And the single biggest risk that you face with a used car
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.800]   is buying something with an unknown history.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.880]   You never can tell with a used car
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.300]   exactly what the history of that car is.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.500]   You might go and buy a car from a dealer.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.980]   That's great, but you don't know where that dealer got it.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.220]   You don't know why the dealer received that car.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.280]   It may have been traded into the dealer
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.780]   because somebody was getting rid of their problem car.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.560]   It just was always sucking up their money
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.400]   and having problems.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.940]   They wanted to get rid of their problem car,
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.000]   and they wanted to replace it with a new vehicle.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.940]   The dealer could have bought it at auction.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.220]   Most dealers, especially used car dealers,
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.220]   acquire their inventory at auto auctions,
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.260]   and they don't have any history of the car.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.220]   Yeah, they have the Carfax report,
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.080]   but all they're doing there is checking
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.900]   to make sure it has a clean vehicle identification number,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.100]   but they don't know anything
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.620]   about the background of the car.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.960]   And so by getting the car at auction,
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.100]   you're getting a car and then selling it to you.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.100]   They don't know anything about the condition of the car.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.220]   Now in today's world, cars are generally very high quality.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.420]   Virtually every brand, virtually every model,
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.100]   high quality, probably no problems.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.380]   It's very unusual in today's world to get a lemon.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.820]   It's very unusual to get something
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.560]   that's not working for you, but there's still that risk.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.200]   And so, let's say you're buying private party
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.040]   in the used market.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.020]   Well, again, private party,
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.400]   is this guy telling me the truth or not?
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.780]   I bought a van a few years ago
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.740]   and it wound up just being a terrible deal.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.540]   I thought I was getting a great deal.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.260]   I got the van at a great price.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.820]   I had checked out the history of the van.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.100]   It was a fleet vehicle,
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.500]   and so I thought this is gonna be great.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.760]   It's gonna be cared for.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.620]   Well, it wound up being in terrible shape
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.940]   and I never figured out the problems.
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.980]   I spent thousands of dollars and I lost money on it.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.460]   And so how do you get out of that solution?
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.740]   How did that problem?
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.740]   Well, the answer is a used car
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.640]   that you know the history of.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.440]   So what's the best way to buy a used car
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.360]   that you know the history of?
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.520]   My answer, from somebody that you know.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.720]   And so if ever I know somebody who is selling a car,
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.080]   I will always go and look at it and think about buying it.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.160]   Because if I can buy a car from somebody that I know,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.440]   that I trust, who can tell me the true history of the car,
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.680]   and I know they're not trying to swindle me in some way,
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.900]   I can potentially save myself quite a lot of hassle,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.260]   quite a lot of money, potentially.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.660]   In addition, by purchasing the cars when they're available,
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.760]   I can get rid of my older cars before they have any trouble.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.620]   I like to drive vehicles for a long time.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.240]   I think that's wise.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.380]   However, there is a point in time
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.280]   at which a vehicle is worth,
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.780]   it just costs you too much to keep it.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.480]   If that weren't the case,
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.760]   then fleet managers wouldn't continually
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.880]   be purchasing new vehicles.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.920]   And so a vehicle can get to the point
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.000]   where it genuinely does absorb too much of your time
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and energy and money to keep it going.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Then you have a problem.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.640]   You have to decide, do I fix this or do I not fix this?
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.840]   And generally you have to fix this and then sell it.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.840]   And then if you have to fix it and then sell it,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.360]   then you have to disclose,
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.800]   hey, this vehicle's having problems,
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.860]   that's why I'm getting it.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.880]   You have to disclose that to the buyer.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.200]   And so you're better off to buy a car,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.440]   use it for a significant amount of time,
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.560]   and then sell it when it's still in perfectly good shape.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.240]   You don't have to conceal anything from the buyer.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.320]   You don't have to change anything.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.920]   You just say, hey, this car has been great.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.120]   Tell them the truth about it and pass it along.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.600]   And so in my mind,
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.880]   this is a good way to deal with car ownership.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.760]   And so I always bid on cars,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.640]   same thing with boats, same thing with any toys.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.020]   If anybody that I know is selling something,
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.660]   I'll always go and check it out
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.300]   and consider making them an offer.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.280]   And of course, sometimes you can negotiate a better offer
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.580]   because you know somebody,
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.860]   you can negotiate a better offer
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.500]   because you helped them just to sell it quickly
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.640]   with no hassle.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.800]   It just works for both.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.000]   It's a win-win for both parties in the transaction.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.220]   But in order to do that, you have to have money.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.540]   You have to have money when the car pops up
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.100]   on the marketplace or when the ski boat pops up
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.560]   on the marketplace and you just walk over and buy it
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.040]   rather than simply waiting until you've saved, et cetera.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.520]   You gotta have money for an extemporaneous purchase.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.000]   Now, back to airplane tickets.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.820]   The same thing has been true with airfares
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.720]   because the deals in the airfare market right now
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.760]   have been absolutely stunning.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.920]   All over the world, you could fly all over the world.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.440]   I was watching tickets quite literally
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   from Florida to Japan round trip for $350 a few months ago.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.800]   Amazing, but of course, Japan is closed.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.000]   So you can't get in.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.840]   So there's these deals are there,
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.240]   but you gotta have the money to buy them,
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.480]   not knowing if or when you may actually be able to use them.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   So I've tried to balance it and purchase some airfare,
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.080]   but my big thing that I wanted to,
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.960]   with travel was to change continents.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.840]   And in my experience,
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.760]   especially in the wake of the budget airline revolution,
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:37.320]   you can get around most continents pretty inexpensively now.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.440]   It's amazing.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.320]   Again, I feel like I use this phrase all the time.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.720]   We live in a golden age, but we genuinely do,
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.580]   especially with regard to travel.
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.660]   We live in a golden age of travel.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.200]   We live in a golden age of international travel right now.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.640]   Most continents except Africa right now,
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.440]   but Africa is coming along,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.760]   but most continents are very cheap to get around
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.920]   because of the wave of budget airlines.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.120]   And I think this trend will continue to get better.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.200]   I expect even markets like Africa to come along
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.800]   over the coming years.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.320]   So if you can get yourself to Europe,
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.760]   of course you can fly around Europe very inexpensively.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.200]   You've got Ryanair, Wizz Air, EasyJet, Pegasus.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.800]   You've got in Asia,
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.560]   I don't need to go through the long list of airlines,
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.320]   but what's still expensive usually
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.260]   is getting between continents.
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.120]   So what I've tried to do
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.360]   is book the intercontinental flights with deals
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   and then just rely on ad hoc purchases of tickets
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.400]   for getting around the local area.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   And that strategy, at least so far, has been working.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.640]   And so I'm happy with that.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.800]   I've flown on some budget airlines.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.720]   Flew on Aeromexico into Mexico.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.220]   I flew from Mexico to Costa Rica on,
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:08.980]   it escapes me, the purple guys.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.720]   And then I flew from Costa Rica
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.900]   to the United States on Spirit.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.640]   We flew from the United States to Europe on Air France.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.080]   And then flew on Air Malta to Malta so far.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.240]   And so the strategy is working.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.080]   So I'd share that with you,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.540]   that if you wanna travel with family,
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.840]   you're gonna need to figure out your strategy for traveling
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.160]   and how you're gonna do it
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   because that is one of those multiplicative costs
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.520]   that children add to your life.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.160]   I don't think much about money with regard to my children.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.080]   I don't really care how much they cost me.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   I want to have children and I'm happy to invest in them
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.520]   and I don't really care whether it costs me more money
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.800]   or I don't really care if I have to work five extra years
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.440]   because I have one more baby.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.800]   I think it's silly to orient your life around money
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.960]   instead of around love.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.080]   But still, there are costs involved
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.920]   and any thoughtful, responsible person
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.660]   recognizes those costs.
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.700]   For the most part, I don't find that the expenses
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.980]   of children are multiplicative.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.460]   I don't find that managing a household of six people
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.700]   is six times as expensive as a household of one.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.860]   However, with airplane travel, it is.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.340]   With restaurants, it frequently is.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:37.100]   With hotels, it's not six times, but it increases
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.780]   with the number of beds that you need, et cetera.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.060]   And so if you're gonna do family travel,
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.980]   you gotta think about that and make a plan for that.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.640]   So let me tell you about our plans
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.300]   as to how we have been moderating the expenses
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.180]   of family travel as well as how we are doing it
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.620]   going forward.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.980]   The first thing that we have done
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.980]   is tried to severely cut down on the amount of luggage
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.220]   that we have.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.540]   I can't evade buying six airplane tickets.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.240]   For a time, I had a baby in arms.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.780]   That was nice for a time,
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:17.080]   but I can't evade buying six airplane tickets.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.140]   But what I can do is I can try to keep those tickets
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.020]   as modestly priced as possible.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.540]   And especially if you're gonna use budget airlines
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:30.380]   to get around, then your luggage is often a big, big factor.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.460]   And so what we set out with a goal of doing
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.500]   was first of all, obviously,
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.960]   to go exclusively with carry-on travel.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.360]   That's important because a lot of times
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.160]   you can book a ticket.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.900]   I think it's called a skip-lag ticket,
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.440]   which, for example,
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.880]   let's say that I had wanted to go to Paris.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.700]   Well, Miami to Paris is often an expensive route,
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.280]   but Miami to Lisbon, which is what I flew,
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.260]   is not an expensive route.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.920]   Not so many people are going to Lisbon
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.080]   as are going to Paris, but I connected through Paris.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.560]   And so what I could have done
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.240]   was simply booked the Miami to Lisbon ticket,
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.400]   Air France, Miami to Paris, Paris to Lisbon,
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.960]   and then gotten off the plane, left the airport in Paris,
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.160]   and never used the leg from Paris to Lisbon.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.800]   And there are lots of these out there,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.200]   these skip-lag tickets,
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.420]   and booking opportunities are out there.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.480]   The problem is airlines don't like them, first of all,
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.680]   so you do face some risk when using them.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.760]   And more importantly, you cannot check luggage
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.780]   when you use those kinds of itineraries
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.580]   because if you check luggage,
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.840]   your luggage will wind up at the final destination.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.920]   So your first thing you need to do is go all carry-on.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.760]   Now we face a challenge of how are you gonna deal
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.840]   with those carry-on suitcases?
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.760]   Because my children are so young and so small,
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.520]   they are not capable of taking care
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.240]   of their own carry-on suitcases.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.560]   And so while there are six of us,
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.640]   I have two adults, and I have a seven-year-old
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.000]   and a six-year-old, who are modestly helpful
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.080]   as long as they don't have to physically carry something.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.600]   What's more challenging though
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.320]   is we have other child paraphernalia.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.520]   I have a four-year-old and a two-year-old.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.440]   Two-year-old isn't a great walker.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.200]   Four-year-old still gets tired of walking.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.360]   So how do I get the two-year-old
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.960]   and the four-year-old around
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.920]   and deal with carry-on luggage?
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.960]   Now all of a sudden now, those six bags
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.160]   that six adults, or two adults
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   and four teenagers traveling together,
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.960]   those six carry-on bags that would be normally
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   quite no big deal, now they're quite burdensome.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.560]   And then you have the challenge
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.680]   of what child paraphernalia do we travel with?
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.880]   Do we travel with a car seat or multiple car seats?
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.720]   I've got one in car seat, I got another in a booster.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.080]   Do we travel with car seats?
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.840]   Do we travel with a stroller?
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.280]   What do you do about midnight airport,
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.880]   walking through the airport at midnight
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   with a two-year-old and a four-year-old
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.360]   who've been woken up out of their sleep and aren't happy?
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.960]   Do we cart them on arms, then how do we do it?
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.200]   And so you have all these challenges.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.440]   And so what we try to do is our strategy was,
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.240]   well, let's go even smaller with the bags.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.800]   And this also can help with budgets
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.440]   because for example, budget airlines,
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.960]   budget airlines are not so budget
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.600]   when you start adding in luggage.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.880]   So the strategy here changes.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.640]   Your first strategy I think is check your bags.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   And when I was younger, before having children,
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.720]   I never checked bags.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.600]   Now that I have children, I find out,
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.440]   wait a second, there was a whole other side of the story
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.520]   that is phenomenal.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.400]   Checked bags are great 'cause all I gotta do
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.480]   is pay the bellhop at the airport
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.960]   to take the bag to the counter.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.840]   The bag goes through,
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.600]   I don't touch it till the final destination
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.760]   and I can just wrangle all my children
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.280]   through the airport and I'm good to go.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   And so I find checked bags now very useful in my life.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.080]   But they're also more expensive
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.880]   and if you're doing skip lag and budget airlines,
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.440]   then now the cost of travel is gonna be more challenging.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.120]   So we wanted to go with entirely personal items.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.920]   Now in a perfect world,
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.320]   we would do Ryanair personal items,
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.600]   but we're not there yet.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.680]   What we did do, meaning they're tiny little,
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.160]   is it 20 centimeters by 20 centimeters by 40 centimeters,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:28.040]   these tiny bags that Ryanair lets you bring without cost.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.960]   I could fly every weekend on Ryanair
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.920]   and never pay a dime for a bag,
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.540]   but I can't do that with children.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.400]   But what we did do was we were able to get
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.120]   into personal item bags.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.040]   And so that was our first strategy.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.240]   We have at this point,
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.160]   we wanted to have five personal item bags
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.280]   plus my carry on my backpack, which is my office,
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.840]   but we wound up with six.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.400]   So we have six under seat personal item bags,
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.080]   the rolly bags that fit under the seat in front of you.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.800]   And that works for the majority of airlines.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.480]   It won't work for Ryanair,
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.160]   but it'll work for the majority of airlines
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   as a free hand luggage.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.960]   And then I have one carry on bag,
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.880]   which is a large backpack that I have.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.200]   And so this strategy works out that with those six bags,
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.600]   I can stack them.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.960]   And so I have a mixture of bags.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.800]   I have some spinny bags with four little spinners
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.640]   on the bottom.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.880]   And then I have a couple of pull behind expandable bags.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.600]   And so the expandable bags are nice
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   because I can keep them at the under seat size.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.000]   But if I have more luggage allowance
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.480]   and I have things I need to do,
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.320]   then I can expand them into standard carry on size.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.240]   And so that gives us more luggage space when we need to,
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.760]   but most of the time I keep them small.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.880]   And with them being spinny bags,
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.200]   I can't remember, is that what they're called?
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.760]   Yeah, the spinner bags.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.920]   Then I can put two of them back to back.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.840]   And I found that this is my best way
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.680]   of schlepping suitcases through an airport
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.000]   is to use the spinner bags, put two of them back to back,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.160]   and then I can drive two of them vertical
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   and I can stack them.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.080]   And so the way that we do it is I have a backpack
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.720]   that has my office in it.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.280]   And at some point I'll do a YouTube video on this,
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.200]   go through it all.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.680]   But I have a backpack that has my office in it.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.880]   It's heavy.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.080]   It's got two big microphones.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.720]   And I went ahead and went heavy on the gear
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.800]   and the equipment and the camera and laptops and such.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.560]   But it's on my back.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.520]   Then I have two spinner under seat bags.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.200]   And then stacked on top of those spinner under seat bags,
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.560]   I have two more under seat bags,
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   which allows me to cart four suitcases myself with one hand
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.600]   and also to have one hand free for passports
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.560]   and boarding passes and all the rest.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.960]   Then we have two more suitcases.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.640]   And then usually I have my two eldest children
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.640]   pull those suitcases because they're roller bags.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   Then we, because they're roller bags,
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.960]   they can handle them.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.520]   They don't have to carry weight.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.040]   And then we decided to go ahead and use a baby backpack.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.460]   So we've got one of the nice, I think it's Deuter,
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.720]   one of the nice big hiking backpack styles
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.840]   for our two year old.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.000]   And so in the airport, it's just a lot easier.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.800]   We put the two year old on my wife's back
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.320]   and the baby backpack.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.920]   And so that way her hands are free.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.880]   She can pull the suitcase if needed.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   And then the backup plan is if we need to transport children,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.160]   I pop off those bags off the spinner bags
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.920]   and I put my youngest two sitting on those bags.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.280]   Then I can trundle through the airport with two suitcases,
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.880]   with a child on each.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.240]   And then we divide the remaining four suitcases
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.120]   between my wife and my two eldest.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.000]   And so that's been working.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.400]   It works in airports.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.480]   We haven't done yet a lot of train stations.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.600]   We haven't yet done a lot of bus stations
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.520]   and such like that, but it does work for airports.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.200]   And I think here, obviously we should also be quick
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.180]   to acknowledge that you just pay people
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.000]   and you rely on the kindness of strangers, right?
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.160]   Strangers will help us down the stairs.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.160]   If we've got a jetway that has a stair that we disembark at,
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.600]   they'll help you on the buses.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.000]   There's nothing to do except rely
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.440]   on the kindness of strangers
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.420]   and or rely on the use of professional porters.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.160]   But that has made travel bearable.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.960]   Let me talk about car seats for a moment.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.680]   One of the things that we found,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.080]   and this is always hard to talk about parenting things
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.840]   because as a parent, you get so judged by everyone.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.360]   But if you have your kid in a car seat,
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.200]   you don't have the latches done right or something
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.720]   and someone, "Oh, this chest strap has to be higher."
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.480]   If you don't have your kid in a car seat,
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.120]   then everyone jumps on you.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.040]   We learned years ago,
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.680]   never ever post pictures of your children
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.040]   and their car seats online
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.480]   or you will be destroyed by the car seat mob.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.020]   What we've done is we found a couple of neat solutions.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:59.400]   One, we have a booster seat for my four-year-old
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   who is of appropriate weight classifications.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.760]   It's a folding booster seat.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.600]   The brand that we went with is one called MyFold,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.260]   M-I-F-O-L-D, MyFold booster seat.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.780]   And it basically takes this,
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.040]   it takes the booster seat
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.200]   and it puts it down into a package
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.160]   that's about, let's say, eight or 10 inches long,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.240]   about an inch and a half to two inches thick,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.560]   and about three and a half inches wide.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.320]   And so it's a very compact package
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.120]   that is super easy to travel with and it works.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.680]   It does exactly what a booster seat does.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.720]   But instead of having padding, raising the child up
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.000]   so that the three-point harness is in a better solution,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.980]   what it actually does is it draws the three-point harness
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.440]   down with a system of straps.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.500]   And so we really like that for our four-year-old.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.540]   Our two-year-old does not meet the appropriate weight
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.120]   and height classifications for a booster seat,
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.700]   but we found a solution
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.760]   that is basically a car seat vest.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.480]   The brand that we chose was a brand called Wizrider.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.360]   I think it's W-I-Z-Z-R-I-D-E-R, Wizrider.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.440]   And what it is, it's a simple fabric vest
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.960]   that you put on the child and a strap around him.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.160]   And then that vest has some anchoring points,
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.920]   some metal anchoring points
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.160]   that use the three-point harness
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.960]   and keep it at a proper, safe location around him.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.520]   So he can just wear that vest
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.520]   and be properly anchored using the Extant harness
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.640]   in the car.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.460]   And so that's been really neat.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.600]   So we take those with us wherever we go.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.800]   We use them for taxi cabs, Uber, whatever.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.720]   We just have them in a small diaper bag
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.400]   that is ready to go.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.600]   And so we hop in a car seat and I do one
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.760]   and my wife does the other.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.360]   And sorry, we hop into a car, I do one,
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.200]   my wife does the other
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.180]   and the children are properly strapped in.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.400]   And I'm pretty happy with those solutions.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.840]   I think they're really good solutions
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.720]   for the children's safety.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.720]   And they keep us from having to cart around something else.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.840]   We thought a lot about a stroller,
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.680]   decided against a stroller,
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.120]   thought a lot about bringing a baby backpack,
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.760]   decided to go with the baby backpack.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.880]   It adds one more thing.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.480]   It's actually the hardest thing that I have
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.760]   to fit into luggage compartments and such,
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.200]   but it does add a lot of range.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.200]   I can carry my two-year-old a lot farther on my back
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.080]   than I can in my arms.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.920]   And so I don't know how long we'll travel with it,
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.720]   but for right now, that's our luggage solution.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.760]   And I'm pretty pleased with it so far.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.540]   You could get away with less luggage
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.520]   on any kind of short-term trip.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:51.520]   So we are traveling for an undefined, indefinite period.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:57.920]   So because of that, we have things like school books.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.880]   We're traveling to a bunch of different destinations.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.720]   So we have an entire bag, one of our entire bags
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.000]   is dedicated to school books, homeschooling books.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.880]   We simplified, but we still do have homeschooling books
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.440]   for my two elder children.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.200]   And although we do use Kindle readers,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.560]   we're pretty opposed to screens,
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.680]   and so we're not doing it.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.740]   We could dump the school books and just use iPad apps,
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.800]   but we've chosen to cart the books around.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.720]   Also then toys, some carefully selected toys.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.760]   And in addition to the toys, some masks,
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.880]   snorkel gear, et cetera.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.560]   And so one of the bags is dedicated to that.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.200]   And so basically we've got, between those, it works.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.000]   So that's our luggage solution.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.360]   And I would highly recommend it to you
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.600]   that as an experienced traveler,
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   the less luggage you have,
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.040]   the happier you will be with your trip.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:58.040]   Luggage is not a, having a lot of luggage
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:03.160]   is not an impediment to a great single destination journey.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.440]   If you're gonna get on an airplane, fly to Cancun,
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.480]   spend a week at a beach resort, fly back,
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.140]   a big suitcase really is no big deal.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.440]   You check it in, they take it there for you,
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.220]   you give it to the porter, give it to the taxi guy,
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.520]   he's got plenty of space, you go to one destination
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.560]   and you're there.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.440]   But when you're traveling the way that we're traveling,
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.240]   changing hotels frequently, changing airplanes,
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.560]   changing airports, changing modes of transportation,
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.360]   getting on trains, getting off trains, et cetera,
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:35.040]   you will curse your luggage daily if you have a lot of it.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.240]   And so I'd recommend to you do everything you can
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.380]   to minimize it.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:44.400]   I should also just address accommodations.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.320]   I forgot, one of the things that we also travel with
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.760]   is we have one of those fold up sleeping pods
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.180]   for my youngest child.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.280]   That has worked very well.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.320]   So far, it generally allows us to do fine with hotel rooms
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.360]   when we're just passing through,
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.920]   not for an extended period of time,
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.440]   but hotel rooms with two queen beds,
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.000]   because what I can do is just book a standard
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.600]   two queen room, put the three elder children in one bed,
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.000]   I put my youngest child on the floor,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.280]   we just take a blanket or a cushion or whatever we find,
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.640]   roll that up and I put down the baby sleeping pod,
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.280]   which folds up and fits inside one of the suitcases.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:27.340]   And that's allowed us to so far get by
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:32.220]   with generally booking one double bed,
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:35.100]   one two queen bed or two double bed rooms.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.020]   And so that's been a good strategy as well
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.460]   that I'm generally happy with.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.820]   How long that's gonna last?
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.540]   I don't know, I'm hoping a couple more years
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.640]   before I have to get two rooms every time.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.740]   (laughs)
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.340]   But we'll see.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.380]   When we're someplace for longer, of course,
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.100]   I get a place with more rooms.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.620]   And so I have been quite fortunate right now,
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.180]   you can hear the children in the other room,
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.900]   perhaps in the background,
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.580]   but I've got a nice three bedroom hotel room
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:05.420]   here in Malta, which has been great.
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.180]   And it comes out right now,
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.740]   this right here is about $100 a night,
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.500]   which I think is within my traveling budget, et cetera.
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.860]   There's some other things that I could talk about,
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.820]   I'll tell you, I miss traveling like this
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.300]   makes me very much miss RV travel with children.
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.940]   I am convinced that RV travel,
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.540]   long-term RV travel is the best way to go
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.380]   to travel with children.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.720]   I really miss it because long-term RV travel
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.700]   is so comfortable because of the stuff, right?
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.060]   You can go where you want.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.800]   And when you travel with as big of a group as we have,
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.860]   many of the other costs do change.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.740]   So for example, oftentimes it's cheaper for me
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.380]   to rent a car than it is to simply take taxis,
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:55.660]   sometimes I have to multiple taxis.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:57.540]   Train tickets, usually people would say,
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.300]   oh, I wanna see Europe by train.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.100]   Well, if you're one person, train is great way to go.
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.240]   Planes are a great way to go.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.780]   When you're six people, all of a sudden,
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:06.940]   driving is often the way to go.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.940]   It's just a more efficient way to get around.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.740]   We had tremendous challenge, not tremendous,
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.580]   that was too much.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.780]   We had challenges in Lisbon with Uber
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:18.460]   because in Lisbon, the requirements,
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.820]   you order an Uber XL and they have the capacity
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.540]   of the Uber XL limited to three people.
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:26.900]   And so even though we're only six people
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.780]   and usually you would be able to order an Uber XL,
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.700]   which would be fine for us as a family of six,
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.020]   all of a sudden now I have to order two cars.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.780]   And so that does take some challenges.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.380]   I miss RV travel.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.180]   I might buy an RV here in Europe
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.740]   and use an RV around Europe.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.700]   The reason I haven't is just simply
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.140]   that I don't intend to stay in Europe
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.340]   for months and months and months,
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.660]   and I'm not sure how to make it worth it.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.140]   Also some challenges of actually owning
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.140]   and registering an RV here in Europe.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.820]   I think I have a solution.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.740]   I think I'll be able to buy a car.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.180]   I'm planning to buy a car here in Europe
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.380]   just to use for the summer.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:07.900]   I think I have that worked out as a non-European resident.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.500]   The next few weeks will tell the story
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.820]   if I figured it out, but I found it quite challenging
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.620]   to figure out as a non-European resident, right?
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.420]   Just a standard American trying to figure out
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.060]   how do you buy a car in Europe is not easy to do.
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.380]   Europeans can easily go to the United States,
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.580]   buy a car, travel around, sell it when they're done with it.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.180]   It's a little bit, it's quite,
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.620]   it's a bit more involved for us here.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.340]   But I think I've cracked that.
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.220]   Just took a lot of research and a lot of legwork
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.100]   to figure out, and so we'll see.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.300]   Next few weeks will tell whether I've succeeded
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.340]   in that or not.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.860]   But RV travel is really great.
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:44.340]   If I had not done quite a bit of travel already
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.260]   with my family, if I hadn't done RV travel,
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.580]   if I hadn't test, pushed our limits,
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.580]   built our muscles, so to speak,
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.060]   to the point where we're pretty easygoing at this point,
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.400]   we can live well in small spaces,
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.140]   we're not super high maintenance,
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.220]   I don't think I'd be having as much fun right now
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.300]   as I'm having.
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.380]   What we're doing now is certainly, it's not easy,
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.200]   and, but it's something we've worked up to
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.260]   because we've gotten better at it,
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.500]   we've gotten stronger at it.
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.700]   And I would remind you that I really think
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.740]   these things are skills.
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.060]   I think most things in life are skills.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.820]   And traveling is simply a skill.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.840]   It's something that you do, and at first,
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.020]   you're not very good at it.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.120]   And then over time, you get better at it.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.260]   And you figure out what works for us.
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.660]   And in the beginning, I would just simply encourage you,
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.700]   don't make long-term decisions
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.740]   based upon short-term information,
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.980]   and recognize that things will change.
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:36.820]   So for example, I try really hard
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.900]   to be thoughtful and thoughtful with the money that I spend.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:44.180]   But when I'm in certain situations
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.060]   where I know that frugality is not an option,
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.780]   I just simply spend the money.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.360]   Usually this involves food.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.260]   When you're traveling with the little baggages we have,
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.300]   I don't have a lot of room for extra food.
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.100]   I can bring a few snacks, but the supermarket thing
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.660]   and whatnot, it doesn't work sometimes.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.740]   And so I just give myself permission,
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.280]   give myself mercy, knowing that,
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.940]   hey, I'll be better in the future.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.500]   But for right now, it's got to spend the money
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.380]   and buy my children what they need
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.180]   so that they're covered.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.660]   The biggest challenge does continue to be
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.940]   what it has always been with travel,
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.580]   is how do you work productively from the road?
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:24.180]   And here, it's not a matter of me,
[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.100]   in the sense that I am very pleased
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.300]   with my mobile office solutions.
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.940]   I'm very pleased with how I've got all that stuff set up
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:36.060]   that I can sit down at any table, any bed, any bench
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.860]   in the world and be productive.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.500]   The biggest challenge continues to be,
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.060]   and I knew it would be, the biggest challenge is simply,
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.540]   how do I make sure that my wife has what she needs
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.740]   to care for the children so that I can have the hours
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:51.220]   dedicated to work that I need?
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:55.460]   I'm behind on some of my work goals,
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:58.900]   which is frustrating, but I try to be
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.700]   not as frustrated about it.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.100]   But my answer to that solution there
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.980]   is kind of setting up longer term things.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.900]   I don't, at this point in time, I don't try to even,
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.400]   I don't even try to work while traveling.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.740]   Because of my responsibilities as a father,
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.060]   traveling is enough work as it is.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.660]   What I do try to do and am trying to do
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:26.660]   is stay places for long enough that we can have the things
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:31.060]   that we need and get into that daily routine of life.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.540]   Because that daily routine is actually very good
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.700]   and very important for children.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.940]   And so having a place where my wife has the space
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.820]   that she needs, the toys that she needs,
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.580]   the books that she needs, the activities, et cetera,
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.660]   where she can take care of young children,
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.580]   homeschool on the road, et cetera, that's really important.
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:53.060]   And so we're trying to stay places for longer.
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:56.220]   Again, I think I'll be in France for either a month
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.780]   or a couple of months this summer.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.740]   And I'm looking forward to that,
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:01.020]   just to being in one place stationary.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.300]   We're here in Malta for two weeks
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.460]   and that's allowing us to go much more slowly.
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.120]   And so there is real virtue and real benefit in slow travel.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.780]   I think that fast travel as a family,
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.480]   unless you are full-time dedicated to it,
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.980]   you're gonna take a year off,
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.780]   you're not gonna be working at all,
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.780]   you're not gonna be trying to be productive,
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.900]   and you've got the money allocated where you say,
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.940]   okay, we're gonna spend $50,000,
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.340]   we're gonna spend $100,000, whatever your budget is,
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.100]   this year on this trip, I think that's fine.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.180]   And that'll work really well.
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.940]   Then you can just do tourist stuff day in, day out.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.580]   But don't expect, especially if you're doing family travel,
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:42.580]   don't expect to be able to do that and work effectively
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:47.100]   with the challenges of travel with your family.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:51.500]   Focus on slow travel and focus on spurts, right?
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.140]   The other thing is set up a base in a place
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.820]   and take a weekend trip from there.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.660]   So if I go and I set up and I get an Airbnb in France
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.880]   for a month, get a monthly booking, big discounts, et cetera,
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.300]   okay, this is where we are,
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.820]   but now we're gonna take the weekend trip to Paris,
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.180]   or we're gonna take the weekend trip to Zurich,
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.740]   or wherever we're going, take your weekend trips,
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.380]   go and see something, and then come back to your home base.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:17.900]   I think that strategy of having a home base
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.140]   and then going out for a short trip
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.160]   is really a better strategy.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.940]   When I was younger, I despised routines.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.200]   I thought, who wants to work nine to five?
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.540]   I wanna work a totally different schedule.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.700]   I didn't care for an office setting.
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.620]   Well, I have learned the error of my ways.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.940]   I've learned that most routines exist
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.220]   for a pretty good reason,
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:42.020]   and that even though I don't need to work from nine to five,
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.380]   I work from nine to five 'cause it works.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.460]   It works with my schedule, it works.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.780]   Routines with family work.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.100]   They make things, they make life easier,
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:53.860]   and making life easier makes life better.
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.420]   I'll wrap up today's episode there.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.140]   I'll give you one final closing charge.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.860]   There are many more things that I could talk about.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.900]   I could share applications that I use,
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.300]   tricks that I've developed, et cetera,
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.780]   but I'll continue to share more of those in the future.
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.740]   I simply want to resolve today's show with this.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:18.960]   We do live in a golden age of travel,
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.220]   and if travel is something that you aspire to,
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:26.380]   it is more doable today than it has ever been.
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:31.200]   It really is, and it's doable with so many strategies.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.260]   You can pay for it, you can do points.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.540]   I've been doing quite a bit of credit card hacking myself,
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.400]   which has been fun 'cause I'm using the benefits,
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.840]   using the miles, the points, et cetera, the statuses.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.860]   That's been fun.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.580]   You can do it just through the simple ability
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:52.340]   to arrive in a new town and with the supercomputer
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.620]   in your pocket, arrange all the needs of your family.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.280]   It's amazing.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.420]   I lost a flight recently.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.020]   I got expelled from a flight.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.340]   They wouldn't let us on 'cause we didn't
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.660]   have the paperwork right.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.780]   And I remember just sitting there,
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:10.100]   and usually, if that had happened 15 years ago,
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.480]   I would have sat there and been hours on the phone
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.220]   and figuring out the money and the tickets and the where.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.780]   It would have just been a nightmare.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.420]   As it was, it was frustrating,
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:21.580]   and it was an expensive mistake,
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:24.740]   but I pulled out my phone, I sat, I thought for a moment,
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.600]   okay, what's the best thing to do?
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.420]   Four hours later, we got on a plane,
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.340]   and it wasn't that big of a deal.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.160]   I went and spent four hours in the airport lounge.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.180]   And so we live in a golden age of travel,
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.120]   this kind of thing.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:41.140]   Sometimes you should be careful with that, right?
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:43.020]   Because if it's something you've dreamed about
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.020]   for many years, you might do it and find out,
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.220]   hey, you know what, it wasn't as awesome
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.040]   as I dreamed about it.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.820]   It was cool, but it came with a whole set of challenges.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:51.860]   That's how I feel about it.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.260]   I really do enjoy going places.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.940]   I really do enjoy seeing new things,
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.600]   but I've done enough of it to know
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.620]   that it's not all roses.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.460]   It comes with a whole lot of hard work.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.980]   But it is more doable today than it's ever been,
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.380]   and it's easier today than it's ever been.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:13.140]   And so get out there and start building the skills.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:16.220]   I'm trying to share some from my experience,
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:20.060]   but one thing you should recognize,
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.100]   while I'm certainly not the man
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:25.660]   with the most frequent flyer miles in the world,
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.020]   I am an experienced traveler.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.380]   And the things that I can do now
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:32.300]   are things that I could not have done before.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:37.020]   I could never have traveled with four children years ago.
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.980]   I remember when my wife and I had one baby,
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.500]   and we just felt like we have no idea what we're doing.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:45.180]   But parenting is a skill, traveling is a skill.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.660]   All of these things are skills,
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.620]   and that if you just stay focused,
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:51.380]   and you build the skills, be patient with yourself,
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:54.060]   be patient with the process, trust the process,
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:58.220]   over time you can genuinely build up these skills
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.660]   and live the lifestyle of your dreams.
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.580]   Thank you for listening.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.460]   I will be back with you just as soon as I can find
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.620]   more time to work. (laughs)
