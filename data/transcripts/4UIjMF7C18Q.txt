[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   The words which most of you will remember, we are considering, are to be found in Paul's
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   epistle to the Romans in chapter 8 and verses 3 and 4. Verses 3 and 4 in the 8th chapter
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.040]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans. "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:32.200]   through the flesh. God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.160]   condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.440]   not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Now, I have suggested that the way to divide
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.320]   the two verses which constitute together one big statement is this. We are told here what
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.520]   the law could not do. Secondly, we are told why it couldn't do it. And thirdly, we are
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.640]   told what God has done which the law could not do, how God has done what the law could
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.560]   not do, and fourthly, what all this leads to as far as we who believe in the Lord Jesus
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.560]   Christ are concerned. Now then, we have already considered what the law could not do and why
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.880]   it couldn't do it. And we are proceeding to consider what God has done and how God has
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.720]   done this which the law could not do. Now, here is a great subject because we have got
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.680]   compressed here into this third verse, a great volume of Christian doctrine and Christian
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.920]   theology. There is no verse, perhaps, which is so packed with doctrine and theology as
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:58.520]   this third verse. So, considering this particular heading of what God has done, it seems to
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.480]   me that this again divides itself up into three sections. One, God has sent his Son
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.920]   into the world. That is number one. Number two, why God sent his Son into the world.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   And three, why it was essential that he should do so. Now, we are still dealing with the
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:35.960]   first section of this further subdivision. God has sent his Son into the world. Now,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.280]   that was the main theme last Friday night when we emphasized these points, that it is
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.840]   God who has done it. Salvation is of God. It isn't men's action, it is God's action,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.720]   and entirely so. God has solved this problem. What the law couldn't do, God has done,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:04.480]   and God has done it. And secondly, we emphasize this expression, his own Son, his own eternal
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.840]   Son, his only begotten Son, his Son eternally generated, who was with him as the Son from
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.880]   all eternity. Now then, that is the point at which we left
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:28.680]   off last Friday evening, so that now we can go on to the next aspect of this matter, of
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.920]   what God has done. He has sent his Son. Where has he sent him? Well, he has sent him into
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:45.320]   the world. And that is put here in this phrase, "in the likeness of sinful flesh." Now,
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:53.680]   here is a great and a striking, and in many ways a staggering statement, and one which
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.480]   is, as I am going to show you, of extreme importance in connection with the whole doctrine
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:09.360]   of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the incarnation. This is a statement of the
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.760]   incarnation. God sent his Son into this world. The babe of Bethlehem is the Son of God. Jesus
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.240]   of Nazareth is the eternal Son of God. Very well, we are looking at him. Here he is walking
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:32.640]   in this world, though he is eternally God's only Son. And nothing is more important, obviously,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:41.200]   than that we should realize the truth concerning him and concerning his person. And this phrase
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.680]   we have got here is one of the most important in the whole of the Scripture, with regard
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.720]   to just that question of the incarnation and the person of our Lord. Because it is a statement
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:06.560]   that defines our Lord's person more closely, more in detail, than perhaps any other.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:15.080]   Now, what I mean is this. There are certain general statements about the incarnation and
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.760]   the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Take, for instance, John 1.14, where we are told,
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:28.280]   "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." Now, you see, that is more general than this
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:37.120]   one. There it is, "The Word was made flesh." But here we have got "was made" in the likeness
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.080]   of sinful flesh. It is more particular. Or take another general one, Galatians 4.4, "When
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.400]   the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.920]   the law." Quite all right, but it does not tell us as much as this phrase here in this
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:03.440]   third verse of Romans 8. Take Philippians 2.7, a tremendous statement about the incarnation.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:14.160]   Here we have got that he made himself of no reputation, and was made in the likeness of
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.320]   men. Still, you see, it is not as specific and not as detailed as the phrase that we
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   are looking at tonight. Then you have got that tremendous statement of it in the first
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:34.680]   epistle to Timothy in the third chapter, and in that sixteenth verse, "Great is the mystery
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:44.120]   of godliness." You remember, God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.040]   of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. God
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.240]   was manifest in the flesh. Again, true, of course, but general, and not as particular
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.960]   and as detailed as our statement this evening. Then you have got it in Hebrews 2.14, "For
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.120]   as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:17.640]   took part of the same." Again, a most wonderful statement, but it is not as detailed as our
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.200]   statement this evening. And then I give you one more, which is in the tenth chapter of
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.120]   the epistle to the Hebrews in verse five, "Wherefore, when he cometh into the world,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.880]   he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me." Now,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.080]   all those are statements, and there are others, of course, which remind us of the fact of
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:51.280]   the incarnation, that the eternal Son of God was in this world as a man. But clearly, that
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.800]   isn't enough. And this phrase that we are looking at this evening tells us more about
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:04.320]   it. It defines it still further. It qualifies those general statements. What does it do?
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:12.160]   Well, the first thing it does is this. It reminds us that the incarnation really was
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:22.800]   a fact. It was a true incarnation. The Son of God did not merely take unto him an appearance
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:33.960]   of a body. He didn't come with a mere appearance of flesh. No, he literally had a human body
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:41.920]   and a human soul. The incarnation is a fact and a reality. Now, why do I trouble to say
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:48.320]   this? Well, because, you know, in the very early days of the Church, this matter caused
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.720]   a great deal of confusion. There were certain false teachers that arose in the Christian
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.280]   Church who taught that Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, did not have a true body.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.240]   It was an appearance, a sort of phantom body. The reincarnation was never real. He appeared
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:14.440]   as a man, but was never really man. The word was not truly made flesh. But that is a terrible
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:20.520]   heresy. And the New Testament is at great pains to tell us and to teach us that that
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:27.160]   was great heresy and error. Indeed, it can be said that the first epistle of John was
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:35.080]   probably written primarily to counter that seriously erroneous teaching. That is why,
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.040]   you see, John starts off in that epistle by putting it like this, "That which was from
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:46.760]   the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:56.480]   looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life." He starts at once. He
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.880]   is dealing with these people who say that, in a sense, you couldn't see and you couldn't
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:08.000]   handle with your hands. He is nailing that terrible heresy which said that our Lord's
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.720]   body was a mere appearance. You see, what they went on to say, not that it matters for
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.920]   us tonight in a sense, is this, that he came into this body and went out of it at the cross
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.000]   so that the Son of God didn't really die. He left this phantom body and all that was
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.960]   on the cross was a mere phantom. Now then, this first epistle of John counters that.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:35.040]   Now, John is so concerned about it that in the fourth chapter of that first epistle,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:42.160]   in the first three verses he says this. "Beloved," he says, "believe not every spirit, but try
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.120]   the spirits, whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:56.920]   world. Hereby, in this way, know ye the Spirit of God, every spirit that confesseth that
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:04.480]   Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that confesseth not that
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.360]   Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit of antichrist,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.720]   whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even now already is it in the world."
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.040]   Now, that is ultimately the test, therefore, of whether we've got true doctrine or not.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.520]   You see, there were preachers going around and they appeared to have great powers, they
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.400]   appeared to have certain spiritual powers and were able to do wonders and to speak in
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.840]   ecstasies and so on. It's all right, says John, don't judge them by their performances,
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   judge them by their doctrine. Do they confess that Jesus Christ has truly come in the flesh,
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.120]   or are they these false teachers who deny that? It doesn't matter how wonderful they
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:55.080]   appear, nor how many miracles they may appear to work. If they deny the reality of the Incarnation,
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:01.320]   they are not of God, that is the antichrist and the spirit of antichrist. In other words,
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.120]   the touchstone by which we should always judge any preacher or any man who claims to have
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:14.720]   spiritual power and authority is his view of the Lord Jesus Christ, his person, this
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.960]   reality of the Incarnation.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.720]   Well there it is, you see, that first epistle of John is devoted to it, but we get it in
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.600]   many other places. Listen to the apostle Peter, who his own self, he says in the first epistle,
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:38.560]   chapter 2, verse 24, bore our sins in his own body on the tree. He was in that body
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.380]   and he bore them in the body, on the tree. But perhaps the most conclusive argument of
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:54.240]   all is this, that the name that our Lord most frequently applied to himself was the Son
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:01.260]   of Man. He referred to himself as the Son of Man. Why? Well, in order to emphasize this
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:08.840]   fact that he was truly man and didn't merely appear to be a man. It wasn't a sort of theophany,
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:15.280]   an appearance of God in human form. He was truly a man and he had a literal, physical
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:21.760]   body as we all have. Not a phantom. That's the first thing it reminds us of.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:32.280]   Secondly, it doesn't merely say, you notice, that he sent him in the flesh. That isn't
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.840]   enough either. These other statements have said that. But obviously it isn't enough
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:45.220]   just to say that. So we must go on and notice another negative, which is this. He goes out
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:53.200]   of his way to say that he did not come in sinful flesh. He says, "in the likeness of
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:03.240]   sinful flesh." Now then, here is an important point. Here again is a heresy. Was the body,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:10.080]   the flesh of the Lord Jesus Christ, sinful or was it not? Now, there were people in the
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:16.280]   early church, as there are people in the church today, who say that our Lord's human nature
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.360]   was sinful, exactly as everybody else's is. That he was born of a woman and therefore
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:29.160]   he inherited from her her sinful human nature. And that our Lord's human nature was a sinful
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.400]   one. They say what happened was this. That though his human nature was sinful, he was
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:42.640]   able not to sin. He rose above it, he mastered it, and he conquered it. But his nature, they
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:49.000]   say, his human nature, was actually sinful, like that of everybody else. And they regard
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.440]   his saviourhood, in a sense, as just that. That he overcame the sin that is in the whole
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.520]   of humanity, and if we look to him and seek his help and his aid, he will enable us to
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:05.320]   do the same thing, and that that is how he saves us. Now, it seems very, very important
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.840]   that we should be clear about this. That, I say, is a teaching that has kept on appearing
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.840]   in the church at different times throughout our long history. It is being taught very
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:24.160]   commonly at the present time. Let me give you but one instance of that. The most famous
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.600]   theologian in the world today is probably that great Swiss, Karl Bach. Now that's his
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.920]   view of our Lord's human nature, that it was sinful. And it is the view held by his followers
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:40.600]   in this and in every other country. So that it is important, I say, that we should be
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:48.000]   clear about this. And that is where this verse you see is so important. If that were true,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.920]   the apostle would have said here, "God sending his own Son in sinful flesh, and for sin condemns
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.840]   sin in the flesh." He goes out of his way not to say that. He says, "in the likeness
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.360]   of sinful flesh." Why does he trouble to do this? Well, because he is anxious that we
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:14.320]   should realize that our Lord's human nature was not sinful. Now, is this an isolated statement?
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:21.680]   Maybe not. Listen to some other statements. You remember the archangel Gabriel announcing
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.000]   the birth of our Lord to Mary. You will find it in the first chapter of Luke's Gospel.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.680]   And I want to call attention particularly to what he said to her in verse 35, where
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.200]   he puts it like this, but the whole context is important. "Mary," you remember, "having
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.320]   been told about this wonderful Son whom she is to bear, couldn't understand it. And she
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:52.120]   said to the angel, 'How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man?' 'The thing's impossible,'
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:58.840]   said Mary. 'I'm a virgin. How can I bear a son? I've never known a man. I'm a virgin.'
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.760]   Then verse 35, "The angel answered and said unto her, 'The Holy Ghost shall come upon
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:13.000]   thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee.'" Then listen, "Therefore also, that
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.480]   holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God." What a description
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:28.600]   of our Lord! What a description of that baby, that holy thing! Why does he call him that?
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:35.040]   Well, because he is holy. There was no sin in him. He's unlike every other babe that's
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:41.280]   been born into this world. Here is the only babe which you can say is holy, that holy
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:52.480]   thing, entirely free from sin, altogether different from all others. But there are other
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:58.880]   statements that confirm this. Now the whole doctrine, of course, of the virgin birth is
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.760]   involved at this point. His birth is unique. There we've been told that his conception
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.840]   is unique. Though she's never known a man, though she's not going to know a man, she's
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.920]   going to bear a child, how is the child conceived? "The power of the highest shall overshadow
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:23.440]   thee." That's the answer. Now this is not simply stated in Luke's gospel, you've got
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.640]   it also in the gospel according to Matthew. Listen to Matthew 1, 18. Now the birth of
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:38.880]   Jesus Christ was on this vial. "When as his son Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:47.800]   came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost." Joseph isn't the father.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:56.600]   They'd not come together. She is found to be with a child of the Holy Ghost. There's
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   the same thing again. And verse 20, Joseph is reprimanded. He thought to put her away,
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.280]   you remember. But he's told this, "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:19.040]   Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost." So that in those
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:25.600]   two verses, 18 and 20, in the first chapter of Matthew's gospel, you've got these specific
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:33.280]   statements which are here to tell us that he has been conceived of the Holy Ghost. The
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.960]   Holy Ghost has, as it were, supplied the germ of life. Here is something that has never
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:47.120]   happened before, has never happened afterwards. Here is a unique birth, something altogether
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:53.800]   in a category on its own. Now this is very important doctrine. Obviously the scriptures
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:59.960]   wouldn't take the trouble to supply us with these statements unless they were of great
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:05.920]   importance. So what we are taught in these statements is, and let me give you some others
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.360]   before I sum it up for you, take the Apostle Paul's way of putting it in 2 Corinthians
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:19.800]   5, 21, "He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.920]   righteousness of God in him." He knew no sin. He not only didn't commit sin, there was no
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:31.280]   sin in his nature. He never knew it in an experimental sense. He never knew it as having
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.960]   it in his nature as a pollution even. It was always outside him. There's a great statement
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:45.440]   of it. Then take that verse which we read at the beginning, Hebrews 4, 15, "For we
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.840]   have not an high priest," he says, "which cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:59.640]   but one who was tempted in all points, like as we are, without sin." Now that's not
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   a good translation at all. It's almost a misleading translation. It should be translated
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:18.840]   like this, "tempted in all points, according to our likeness, apart from sin." Now that's
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:25.000]   another exact statement of our phrase here in Romans 8, 3. Here it's put, "in the
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.040]   likeness of sinful flesh." There it is put, "according to our likeness, apart from
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.400]   sin," which means, of course, that he is like us, apart from the sin. In other words,
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.920]   he is in the likeness of sinful flesh. It isn't sinful. It's apart from sin, but
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:48.620]   it is in the likeness of that. It's the very self-same statement that we are considering.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.400]   But then there's another very wonderful statement of it in Hebrews 7, 26, "For such
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:22:03.040]   a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:09.440]   higher than the heavens." Now you notice the description of him. He's got to be holy
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:16.960]   and harmless and undefiled, separate from sinners. In other words, he is perfect. He
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:24.000]   is without sin. There is no blemish in him in any respect at all.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.040]   And there, of course, you've got the same thing once more in the ninth chapter of the
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:38.200]   epistle to the Hebrews, in verse 14, where we read this, "How much more shall the blood
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:47.000]   of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, without
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:56.800]   spot to God, purge our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" Which links
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:02.520]   up, of course, with what Peter says in his first epistle, first chapter, verse 19. He
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.080]   says we are saved not with silver and gold, but what, with the precious blood of Christ
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:16.920]   as a lamb without blemish and without spot. And of course, when you go back to the Old
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:22.000]   Testament, you will find the regulations laid down about the lamb that was to be taken and
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   to be sacrificed, and the point is always made that there must be no blemish in it.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.080]   Why was that to be true of the type? Well, because it was to be true of the anti-type.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.600]   They couldn't take a lamb which had got a blemish that wasn't accepted. It had to be
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.520]   a lamb which, as far as they could tell, was absolutely perfect, without any blemish whatsoever,
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   to typify the fact that when the Lamb of God came, he'd have no blemish at all. Well, if
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:52.040]   he's got a sinful nature, he's got a very great blemish. His nature is polluted. So
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.720]   all these statements work together, you see, to substantiate this claim which is made in
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   the verse that we are looking at this evening, that our Lord's human nature was not sinful,
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:11.600]   but that it was like our sinful nature. And if you want one other, you'll find it in the
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.840]   first epistle of John again, chapter 3 and verse 5. And you know that he was manifested
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:25.840]   to take away our sins, and in him is no sin. Now then, what is the doctrine? Well, I can
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:37.440]   put it to you in this form. That our Lord in the incarnation took unto him a human nature
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:46.160]   that had been rendered free from sin. Now, it's very interesting that the Roman Catholics,
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:53.120]   at this point, are not only right, but in their anxiety to be right, go so far as to
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:59.400]   say something that is wrong. What is it they say? Well, in their great anxiety to safeguard
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   this fact that our Lord's human nature was not sinful, they go so far as to say that
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.840]   the human nature of the Virgin Mary was not sinful. That is what is called the doctrine
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:17.040]   of the immaculate conception. Now, I find people very often think that when they hear
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.200]   about the doctrine of the immaculate conception, that it's simply a statement of the fact that
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:28.560]   our Lord's nature was free from sin. That isn't what it means at all. The immaculate
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:36.040]   conception as taught by the Church of Rome says that the human nature of Mary was sinless.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:43.240]   And there is not an iota of evidence to support that in the whole of Scripture. Not an iota.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:51.520]   Mary was human like everybody else. Her human nature was most definitely and decidedly sinful.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.440]   She is a descendant of Adam, like everybody else is a descendant of Adam. And she has
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:02.720]   received the polluted, fallen human nature that everybody born into this world has received
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.640]   as the result of Adam's transgression. The Apostle has proved that to us in chapter 5
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.040]   of this epistle to the Romans. Very well, then, what is the teaching? Well, the teaching
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:21.400]   is this, not that Mary had been rendered sinless, but that that portion of Mary, that cell out
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:28.000]   of Mary, which was to be developed into the body of the Son of God, that that was cleansed
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:37.040]   from sin, and that only. So that Mary remains sinful, but this portion that she transmits
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:44.640]   to her Son has been delivered, set free from sin. And it is to that that the Son of God
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:50.640]   is joined. That is the human nature that he takes unto himself. It's a miracle, of course.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.960]   And we are told specifically that it is a miracle. It was because she didn't realize
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.400]   that a miracle was to happen that Mary stumbled at the announcement of the Archangel Gabriel.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:05.160]   And his reply is, "Don't try to understand this, but the power of the highest shall overshadow
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.320]   thee. The Holy Ghost will come upon thee. You're going to conceive of the Holy Ghost.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:16.480]   He has power to work this cleansing, so that the body and the human nature of the Son of
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:26.600]   God shall be entirely free from sin." So we reject the doctrine of the immaculate conception,
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:33.040]   but we assert with all our power and all we have the doctrine that the human nature of
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:41.720]   the Son of God was entirely free from sin. But why should anybody ever want to doubt
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:49.360]   this, you say? Why should they say that the Lord's human nature was sinful? And what they
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.480]   try to say, of course, is this, that they can't see how he could be tempted truly unless
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:01.560]   this was true of him. They feel that it is essential to the fact that he should have
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:09.480]   been liable and subject to temptation, like as we are. Well, now, the reply to that, of
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:16.560]   course, is again simply Hebrews 4.15, "Tempted in all points like as we are apart from sin."
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.960]   Tempted to sin, but there was no sin in him. He was tempted in every way like we are, but
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:28.080]   there was no sin in him. Sin apart, if you like, apart from sin. But not only that, it
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:36.320]   is entirely a fallacy to say that we cannot be tempted unless there is something within
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.440]   us that responds to it. Because, after all, Adam, when he was tempted, had not got a sinful
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:49.040]   nature. Adam, when he was tempted, had a perfect human nature. He was tempted, Adam and Eve
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.320]   were tempted, in a state of perfection. So that, obviously, a temptation can have force
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:00.980]   and power, though the nature is not evil. And that really is an answer sufficiently
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:07.520]   in and of itself. I would not hesitate to assert this, that our Lord knew the power
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.960]   of temptation in a way that no human being has ever known it. The devil brought out all
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.720]   his reserves, he brought out all his subtlety, he put it as attractively as he could. We
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   see it in the three temptations in the wilderness. He undoubtedly came back many another time
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:29.960]   and brought all his power of deception to bear upon him. But our Lord did not fall,
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:36.840]   but he felt the power of temptation. He had a view of the subtlety of the devil and sin
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:43.120]   and evil and temptation, such as you and I can never know. That, then, is the answer
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:51.480]   to that. But, furthermore, what these good friends seem to me to miss is this. Can you
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:30:04.960]   conceive of the Godhead combining in one person with sin, with sinful human nature? The thing
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:14.480]   is inconceivable that this divine, eternal nature, for he is God, eternal God, the Son.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:24.840]   How can that possibly combine in one person with a sinful human nature? The thing doesn't
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:34.520]   bear thinking about. It is quite inconceivable. And then add to that this final argument.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:45.000]   Our Lord, according to the teaching of the Scripture, did not come into the world simply
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:55.360]   to cleanse that first humanity that had been created in Adam. He came to bring in a new
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:03.280]   humanity. That is why, you see, Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15, puts it like this. The first
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:09.240]   men and then the second men. The first men is of the earth, earthly. The second men is
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.880]   the Lord from heaven. Now, this is the most important point to me. What God has done in
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:23.640]   Christ is to start a new race, a new humanity, which has its link with the old humanity in
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   this portion that was taken from Mary, which was rendered free from sin, so that, in a
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:34.040]   sense, you can say, it is still the old humanity, yes, but it has been so cleansed that it can
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:42.400]   be the start of a new humanity, so that Jesus Christ is the second man. Adam was the first
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.680]   man. Adam was the head of a human race. Jesus Christ is the head of a human race. The second
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:58.320]   man. Here is the firstborn amongst many brethren. Here is God starting, I say, a new pattern,
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:05.640]   a new race, as it were, of men, a new humanity, that link with the old, but something which
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:13.040]   is essentially new. And as we bear that in mind, I think we see how utterly important
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:19.760]   it is that we should realize that his nature wasn't simple. When God made the first men,
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.600]   he made him perfect. Adam's human nature was not a simple human nature. The man, the first
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.240]   man that God brought into being, was entirely free from sin in every respect. So was the
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   second. If you say that Christ's human nature was sinful, you are, in a sense, making him
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:43.920]   a lesser man than the first man, less perfect, less complete, which is, again, unthinkable.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:50.840]   Not only that, you have got to look at it in this way. As I was saying, I think it was
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:56.320]   last week, what makes this salvation of ours so certain and sure is this, that it cannot
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:03.800]   fail. It cannot fail. Sin doesn't enter in here as it entered into the first. It cannot
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:11.880]   enter in. And that is because the eternal Son of God has taken unto himself this human
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:18.120]   nature, and he bears it through, spotless and perfect, without ever falling, and without
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:23.200]   any trace of sin in any connection belonging to it.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:31.560]   Very well then, so the apostle emphasizes here that he didn't come in sinful flesh.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:38.840]   But he does go out of his way to say that he came in the likeness of sinful flesh. And
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:44.640]   there is a positive element in this. And the positive element is a very valuable one. It
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:56.400]   means this. He had the true flesh. He was truly human. His human nature was not an appearance,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:06.920]   it was a reality. He was truly a man. He had a rational soul, like every one of us has.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:14.040]   But it wasn't sinful in any way at all. But it was like our sinful human nature in certain
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:25.440]   respects. In what respects? And the answer seems to be this, inevitably. That though
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:33.880]   his human nature was not in itself sinful, it did have some of the characteristics that
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:42.360]   belong to our human nature as the result of sin. What do I mean? I mean something like
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:56.120]   this. Sin not only pollutes human nature, it brought into it certain infirmities. Now
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:07.560]   Adam, before he fell, had no infirmities at all. Adam was perfect. He did no fatigue.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:16.800]   He couldn't have been ill. He was innocent and he was without sin. But as the result
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:23.080]   of his sin and his fall, he not only became sinful and perverted in his nature, certain
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:28.280]   weaknesses entered into his life and they have been transmitted ever since. Now the
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:36.080]   Bible makes it very clear that our Lord had some of these infirmities. Now infirmities
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.400]   are not sinful in and of themselves. What am I thinking of? Well, I'm thinking of
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:53.560]   fatigue, tiredness, weariness, pain, sorrow, grief, disappointment, the capacity to weep.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:36:00.600]   All those were evident in our Lord. Let me give you some others. We read about him at
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:06.160]   the end of the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke, two statements like this. First of
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:13.000]   all, verse 40, "And the child grew and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.880]   the grace of God was upon him." Then verse 52, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:27.640]   stature," you see he was able to grow, "in wisdom and stature, and in favor with
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:35.760]   God and men." Yes, and also, as we've seen again in Hebrews 4, verse 15, he now
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:42.880]   was subject to temptation. James tells us that God not only does not tempt, but cannot
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:48.440]   be tempted. And if our Lord had not become truly human, if he hadn't really become
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:54.400]   a man, he wouldn't even be subject to temptation. But he was subject to temptation, yes, because
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:00.640]   he came in the likeness of sinful flesh. And then you notice those other remarkable
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.600]   statements which are made about him in that portion that we read at the beginning in the
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:12.120]   fifth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews. "Every high priest taken from among men
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:17.560]   is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:23.160]   for sins, who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way, for that
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:29.960]   he himself also is compassed with infirmity." And this is true of the Son of God. He is
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:35.080]   compassed with infirmity. You see, we have not a high priest which cannot be touched
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:41.560]   with the feeling of our infirmities. Why not? Well, because he knew these infirmities himself.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.440]   He knew what it was to be compassed with certain infirmities. He was not aware of certain things.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:53.320]   You take the instance, for instance, take that instance of the barren fig tree. He obviously
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   didn't know that it hadn't got fruit on it. He says about the day of the second coming
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.240]   that he doesn't know it. Not only does no man know the time of the second coming, he
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:09.440]   says even the Son doesn't know it, only the Father. Now these are parts and indications
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.800]   of this infirmity. So that this fifth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews sheds great
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:21.640]   light upon this phrase that we're looking at in Romans 8, 3 this evening. "He came
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:29.880]   in the likeness of sinful flesh." You looked at him and he appeared to be frail. He was
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.680]   tired, he was weary. We read in the incident of the woman of Samaria that when the disciples
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.320]   had gone to buy provisions, he sat by the side of the well because he was tired. He
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.280]   seems to have been more tired than they were. Now that's an infirmity. So he came in the
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:55.360]   likeness of sinful flesh. His flesh wasn't sinful, but it was like it in these particular
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:04.520]   respects. Now then let me ask a final question. Why was this essential? Why did he have to
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:12.360]   come in this particular way? Why did God send his Son into the world in the likeness of
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:23.760]   sinful flesh? And the answer is this, that man is man, and that God sent his Son to save
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:31.560]   man. And therefore in order to save man, he has to become man. Now this is put best of
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:40.400]   all in the second chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews. First of all in verse 9. He says,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:48.640]   "We do not see at all things put under men, but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:55.200]   than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.520]   grace of God should taste death for every man." There's the first statement of it.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:11.640]   Take verse 11. "For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one,
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren." Now these verses are tremendously
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.760]   important. Take that tenth verse before that. "It became him for whom are all things and
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:30.280]   by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation,
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:37.640]   the leader of their salvation, which is Jesus Christ perfect as a captain through sufferings."
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:42.360]   And you see, in order that he might do it through sufferings, "he that sanctifieth and
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.720]   they who are sanctified are all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:54.880]   brethren." He's got this human nature that they've got. Very well, there's another statement
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:01.200]   of it, but then go on to verse 14. "For as much then as the children are partakers of
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:07.960]   flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.280]   he might destroy him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil." Because you and
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.080]   I have got flesh and blood in order to save us, he's got to take on him flesh and blood.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:23.160]   That's the argument. And then look at verse 16 and 17. "For verily," he says, "he took
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:29.880]   not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore, in
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:37.320]   all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:42.620]   and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:48.320]   of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.400]   them that are tempted." Now let me try to expound all this to you. Why did he have to
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:42:05.120]   come in the likeness of sinful flesh? One, he had to keep and to honor the law. Man is
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:11.240]   under the law, and he has broken it, and therefore the law condemns him. And before man can be
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.880]   reconciled to God, he must keep the law, he must bear its punishment, he must actively
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:22.080]   obey it. Jesus Christ came into the world to be our representative, to do that for us.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.560]   Man can't do it. Man has failed to do it. There is none, just no, not one. All have
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.920]   sinned and come short of the glory of God. The whole world lieth guilty before God. I'm
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.640]   quoting from the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans. Now then, man can't do it,
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.120]   God can't do it, what the law could not do. God sends his Son. What for? To be our representative.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.560]   What's he got to do as our representative? He's got to keep the law. Very well, then
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.440]   he must be born under it. That means he's got to become a man. He's got to take on
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:55.760]   human nature. He couldn't keep and honor the law for us unless he had done this. Not
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:03.520]   only that, this guilt has got to be born. And how can he bear the guilt unless he is
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:08.840]   likened to us, as this man argues? So, in order to take our sins and our guilt upon
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:17.000]   him, and to bear their punishment, he had to take on human nature. God, as God couldn't
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.560]   do that, the Son had to become incarnate before he could do that. He has to be partaker of
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:28.040]   flesh and blood as we are. He must be a man to be man's representative, to be the start
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:36.680]   of this new humanity. As sin had been committed in the body, so it must be punished in the
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:44.920]   body, which is the next phrase. In the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemn sin in
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:50.960]   the flesh, not in theory, but in the body of his own Son. All right, that's the second
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:57.720]   point. Third point. Before he can save us, he must not only do all that, but he must
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:06.660]   give us a new nature. We need to be made partakers of the divine nature. And the only way to
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:14.040]   do that is this. He has done that to human nature. He has taken it unto himself, and
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.800]   he is able to give it to us. If he had not become incarnate, we could never have become
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:29.000]   partakers of the divine nature and the sons of God. Fourth, as is argued out so wonderfully
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.600]   there in Hebrews 4 and 5, this is the only way whereby he could become our sympathetic
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:42.400]   high priest. You know, if he hadn't done this, we wouldn't be able to pray. Who are
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.360]   we to ascend into the hill of God? Who are we to go into the presence of the eternal
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:53.680]   God, who is a consuming fire? No, no, there's only one way whereby I can pray and go into
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.020]   the presence of God with confidence. It is this, that we have not an high priest which
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:04.080]   cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. No, no, he's come in the likeness
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.880]   of sinful flesh. He was made flesh, he's truly man, and he's lived in this world.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:15.520]   He knows he can bear with us, he can sympathize with us, he can strengthen us. He is a sympathetic
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:21.720]   high priest because he came in the likeness of sinful flesh. He knows what it is to be
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:27.320]   weary and tired, hungry and thirsty. He knows what it is to be disappointed in his friends.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:33.680]   He knows what it is to feel grief and sorrow. He knows what it is to weep. Thank God he
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:40.600]   came in the likeness of sinful flesh. It makes him our sympathetic high priest.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   And then, listen to this, if he hadn't come in this way, he could never have conquered
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:52.760]   death for us. Before death can be conquered, a human nature must be able to go through
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:46:00.360]   it and come out the other side. He's done it. He is the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:06.200]   For as the apostle Paul put it in preaching to Agrippa and Festus and their wives, that
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:13.640]   he should be the first to rise from the dead. Here is a new man that's conquered death
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:19.720]   and left it behind forever. He dieth no more, as Paul has told us in chapter 6 in verse
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:25.040]   10 of this epistle to the Romans. Yes, and because he's done it, we can be sure of
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:31.920]   our resurrection. He puts it in 1 Corinthians 15, 21 in this way, "For since by man came
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:38.520]   death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead." If it's man who's gone
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:45.800]   down, it's a man who must go up. Therefore, he had to become man. That's the argument.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:54.040]   And that brings me to my last reason, which is this, the sixth. This is the only way to
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:47:04.360]   silence the devil to all eternity. What do I mean? I mean something like this. Ever since
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:10.640]   the fall of man, the devil has been taunting God. He said, "You made man in your own
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:18.200]   image. Look at him. I've got him. I've mastered him. What can you do about him?
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:28.600]   Your great plan has gone wrong." Now, if God had saved man by any other means or method,
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:37.520]   save the one that he's adopted, the devil could never have been silent. If great spiritual
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.400]   power were given from heaven, the devil would say, "Yes, but that isn't fair. You see,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:49.880]   it isn't man. If he came down on earth, he couldn't stand. I'd tempt him and I'd
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:56.480]   get him down." Very well, God sent his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh. He made
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:01.480]   him under the law, made of a woman, made under the law. He is subject to temptation. The
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.880]   devil was given a full opportunity, but he failed. There stood before him one whom he
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.680]   regarded as a man only, and he could find nothing in him. And he failed to trap him.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:19.120]   He failed to ensnare him. He failed to drag him down. He's defeated. So that it's
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.960]   argued, therefore, in Hebrews 2, you see, "For as much then as the children are partakers
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:28.520]   of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:34.360]   he might destroy him that had the power of death." That is the devil. The devil is
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:46.880]   silenced once and forever. Man is in Christ restored unto the image of God, and will be
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:53.600]   made finally perfect and complete. You see, you remember, don't you, how Paul
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:49:00.480]   argued there in chapter 3, verse 26? He says, "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.840]   through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:11.520]   are passed through the forbearance of God." To declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness,
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:20.920]   that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. That means that
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:28.680]   the devil has got nothing to say. Man it was that sinned. Very well, it is man that must
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:35.280]   be punished. Man sinned in the flesh. Sin must therefore be punished in the flesh. And
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:43.480]   God has done it. Jesus Christ was man. The sins were laid upon him. They were dealt with
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.720]   in his body. The devil is silenced. He's got nothing to say. God is vindicated. God
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:56.800]   is just. But at the same time, he can now justify all who believe in Jesus. But you
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.840]   see, if it had been done in any way except this way, which is that Christ has been sent
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:06.520]   in the likeness of sinful flesh, the devil could be saying all along, "Ah, but wait
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.320]   a minute, it all happened in the body. It happened in human nature, and you've got
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.000]   to deal with it in human nature." He can't say that now because it has been dealt with
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:24.880]   in human nature. And there is no condemnation. The devil is silenced, so that Paul, later
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.840]   on in this eighth chapter, is able to say, "Who shall bring anything against God's
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:36.120]   elect? Who shall bring any charge against them?" Nobody. There is nobody anywhere
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:48.600]   in heaven or in hell or anywhere else that can bring any charge whatsoever. None. Because
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:55.480]   it is God's work. It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:01.360]   died here, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand, who also maketh
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:07.840]   intercession for us. It happened in this way. God sent his Son in the likeness of sinful
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:15.240]   flesh for those reasons, and the greatest of all is the last. God's glory is vindicated.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:25.320]   God's honor, God's justice, God's righteousness is revealed, manifested, glorified for all
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:42.520]   eternity. Because his Son came in the likeness of sinful flesh as man for man, he did the
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:53.680]   work and did it perfectly. And God is just and the justifier of him that believeth in
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.040]   Jesus. Let us pray.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:06.000]   O Lord, our God, we come again before thee to offer our wondering praise and thanksgiving.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:17.520]   O Lord, we have been looking into the infinities. Great is the mystery of godliness. How we
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:24.600]   bless and praise thy great and holy name for it, that thy ways are not our ways, nor thy
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:31.360]   thoughts our thoughts. O God, we thank thee that thou dost allow us to look into these
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.080]   things. We thank thee for thy word. We thank thee for this particular statement we have
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:43.200]   looked at tonight, that he came in the likeness of sinful flesh. O we bless thy name for the
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:48.120]   comfort of knowing that our high priest is of such a nature and a character, that he
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:55.320]   was in this world, that he endured, he was tried and tempted, buffeted, taunted. O God,
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:53:01.480]   we thank thee that he, such a one, is at thy right hand and that therefore we can come
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:11.000]   with boldness to the throne of grace to obtain mercy, to find mercy and obtain grace to help
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:19.440]   in time of need. O Lord, bless these truths to us. We pray thee more and more, enable
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:27.080]   us to see them, to rejoice in them, to rest upon them, to pray on their basis and ever
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:35.160]   to be well pleasing in thy most holy sight. Hear us, O Lord, as thus we offer our thanksgiving.

[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.480]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:55.920]   the remainder of this our short, uncertain, earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
