[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.480]   All right.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.840]   Let's see what else we have here.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.920]   I've got a question from DK.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.560]   DK is asking if I have any suggestions on what
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.920]   habits to add and improve when going from a PhD to a postdoc.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.560]   Postdocs are highly autonomous as compared to PhD programs.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.920]   It's all about research.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.640]   Build your whole day around research.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.080]   That's what it's about, is doing research, doing research well.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.360]   You will find that you probably have more free time
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.560]   than you're used to.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.240]   Because if all you're doing is research,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.200]   there's only so much of you doing
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.440]   the research during the day.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.920]   That's fine.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.240]   Just build a schedule that doesn't require as many hours.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.620]   I'll tell you what I did, DK, when
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.640]   I switched from my doctoral work to my postdoctoral work,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.600]   is I was looking ahead to when I was
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.680]   going to become a professor after being a postdoc.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.880]   And I said, when I'm a professor,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.720]   my time is going to be way more limited than it is right now
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.560]   as a postdoc.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.640]   I'm going to have classes.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.240]   I'm going to have committees.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.560]   I'm going to have students to supervise.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.960]   And so I don't know--
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.080]   in addition to practicing research as a postdoc,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.560]   I want to practice being effective at doing research
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.800]   even if I have reduced time.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.200]   So I added artificial constraints to my schedule.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.520]   I had a dog at this point.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.960]   It lived about a mile from campus.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.040]   I've talked about this before, across the bridge in Beacon
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.640]   Hill.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.520]   And so I built a schedule where I'd start at 9,
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.720]   but I'd take a two-hour block out of the middle of every day,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.400]   where I'd take my dog, Bailey.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.240]   We'd go for a run.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.240]   We'd run from the East Campus there of MIT, down the Charles.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.000]   We would go down to the Mass Avenue Bridge.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.640]   We'd cross at the Mass Avenue Bridge,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.360]   come running back on the Charles on the Boston side.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.040]   We'd exercise calisthenics on one of the docks that's
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.080]   out in the Charles River off of that size.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.760]   And if it was winter, we would dig out a spot on that dock
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.480]   out of the snow to do our push-ups.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.000]   We were hardcore about it.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.320]   We'd do our pull-ups.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.240]   And so we'd do this long run.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   Weather didn't matter.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.360]   I had gear.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.760]   Go back to my apartment on Beacon Hill.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.920]   I would have lunch.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   I would take a shower.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   And then I would walk back to campus,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.880]   now crossing the Longfellow Bridge.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.600]   This is like a two-hour-plus thing.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.880]   But I wanted to put an artificial constraint
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.520]   in my day to say, OK, I not only need
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.200]   to get used to doing research, but getting
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.560]   a lot of research done when I only
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.080]   have a limited amount of time.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.360]   So I felt like I was training.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.040]   I also wrote a book.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.240]   So I wrote most of Sogo They Can't Ignore You
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.440]   during my postdoc as well.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.720]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   It's all about research.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.120]   Get used to research, making progress on research.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.800]   Don't worry about having too much time.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.920]   In fact, this is a good time to do something else
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.480]   so you can practice doing that research with some constraints.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.040]   It's an awesome job, basically, DK.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.240]   It doesn't pay well, but it's otherwise an awesome job.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.000]   So enjoy it.
