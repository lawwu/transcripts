[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.120]   - All right, Jesse, let's do some calls.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.580]   Who do we have on the old call docket today?
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.000]   - Okay, our first call is from Mark.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.320]   He's like you, he's a professor in DC,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.140]   and he has a question about finding the opposing views
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.540]   when you're dealing with certain topics.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.340]   - Hi, Kel, my name is Mark,
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.320]   and I'm also a professor at an R1 university in the DC area.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.940]   My question for you is the following.
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.140]   Often on your show, you'll discuss this idea
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.840]   of building up the Socratic dialectic, as you call it,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.200]   or finding the best thinkers or writers or speakers
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.140]   from opposing viewpoints on a given topic.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.560]   My question is the following.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.880]   If you want to explore a given topic,
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.540]   but perhaps you're not as familiar with the topic
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.920]   enough to kind of know who the key thinkers
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.280]   are on that topic,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.640]   how would you go about the specific mechanics
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.720]   of identifying who the best speakers were
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.600]   for that specific topic?
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.040]   For example, let's say I wanted to understand
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.600]   the causes of the Baltic War.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.840]   It's not a topic I'm typically familiar with.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.840]   How would I go about finding the two or three
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.560]   best thinkers or speakers on that,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.960]   given that I have no knowledge of that area?
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.300]   So this is sort of the curse of knowledge situation,
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.780]   where if I know who the best thinkers are,
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.980]   I'm probably already knowledgeable enough
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.800]   about the field to understand what the key points are.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.080]   But if I'm just entering something for the first time,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.600]   it's actually quite difficult to do what you're describing.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.480]   Thank you for your time.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.760]   - It's a good question, Mark.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.520]   Let me start by just underlining the bigger picture method
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.200]   that Mark was talking about here.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.720]   So it's one of the big points I've been making on this show
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.280]   since the beginning,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.360]   is when it comes to having an interesting,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.720]   thriving, resilient, but also authentic
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.060]   and value-producing intellectual life,
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.220]   you have to be very worried about
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.300]   or wary of intellectual groupism.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.740]   And this is where you say,
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.300]   I just want to be told
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.820]   what I'm supposed to think about something,
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.580]   who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.540]   Your mind knows that you are being subservient
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.100]   when you do that, and it's not happy with yourself.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.040]   It's not a approach to intellectual life
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   that is sustainable.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.800]   It makes you feel bad about yourself.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.160]   And it brings you into weird tribal places.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.080]   It's also, by the way,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.200]   the dominant mode of intellectual discourse on social media.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.160]   So beware if you are wandering through the waters of Twitter,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.520]   you're wandering through the waters of,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.480]   I don't know what people use these days, Instagram.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.000]   So my alternative, and by my,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.580]   I mean this goes back to the very early days
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.520]   of systematic thinking about thinking,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.460]   is the Socratic dialectic method.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.700]   If you want to understand something better,
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.940]   listen to really good thinkers on multiple sides of it.
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.620]   In that collision, you see what resonates,
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.480]   you get more insight,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.220]   you get a more nuanced rooted understanding of that topic.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.300]   One that you can actually base real action on
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.220]   and feel good about it.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.540]   If by contrast, you just do intellectual groupism,
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.300]   your mind often is not going to really trust your stance
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.000]   because you know you're just following a crowd.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.340]   So it's not a good foundation for action.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.140]   You don't feel confident taking action.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.060]   You don't feel confident taking real action based off it.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.140]   So then you end up just doing very little about a cause,
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.820]   maybe like tweeting about it or yelling at people,
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.400]   or like getting mad at your cousin or something like this.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.680]   And nothing really happened.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.160]   So there's this irony of intellectual groupism
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.600]   is that often people think this is the key
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.560]   to changing the world.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.080]   If we could just get people to just be on our side
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.940]   and don't question it and attack the other side,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.060]   then we'll change this issue.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.440]   But actually what you do is you defang people's
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.200]   actual activist impulses and very little action is taken
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.840]   because they don't trust the intellectual foundation
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.680]   of what they believe.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.720]   They just vaguely think you're on their team
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.040]   and don't want to get yelled at.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.780]   So encounter real argument, real argument on both sides.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.080]   You will not be tricked.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.100]   Your deep moral intuitions will not be tricked
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.140]   because you read a particularly clever National Review
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.400]   or Mother Jones article.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.560]   It's not going to trick you.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.680]   It's going to make your beliefs stronger and more nuanced.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.320]   It's actually going to make you a better advocate
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.240]   for what you believe in.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.520]   So how do you find these things?
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.000]   Well, for really specific issues like the Baltic War,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.700]   you know, something that's kind of niche,
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.080]   you don't have to find from scratch the best thinker.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.960]   You just have to find someone who knows about it
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.600]   and ask them who the best thinker is.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.840]   That's almost always the right way to do it.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.320]   Like, oh, here's a professor who wrote an article
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.640]   about the Baltic War.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.720]   That's why I'm thinking about it.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.800]   I read this article.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.280]   Let me talk to this person.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.400]   Like, hey, what are like the definitive books on this?
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.660]   Who are the definitive thinkers on it?
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.840]   What are the different sides of this?
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.280]   You can do that for almost any topic.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.600]   Find someone who knows about the topic
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.120]   and then ask them who they think the best thinkers are.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.400]   Now, if there's already a clear tribal divide on the topic,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.320]   just find a reasonable person who
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.640]   seems to be roughly speaking on one side.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.520]   Find a reasonable person who, roughly speaking,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.920]   seems to be on the other side.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.080]   And say, what are the best articles
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.440]   or books about this topic?
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.820]   Then you're going to get those two opposing viewpoints.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.560]   You read them both.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.560]   Let them collide.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.840]   You are going to have the more nuanced understanding.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.340]   All right.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.760]   So Mark, I appreciate the question
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.000]   because it gives me a chance to go back
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.920]   to that general thinking.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.840]   There's actually a name I heard for that approach
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.120]   to intellectual life, especially culturally relevant
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.400]   intellectual life.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.320]   It was a name that was coined by a former doctor who is now
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.800]   a full-time podcaster YouTuber who
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.960]   talks about medical issues.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.160]   And he goes by-- and this name is not
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.920]   going to make you feel better about what I'm about to tell
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.560]   you here-- but he goes by the name ZDogg with two Gs, MD.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.240]   That's how you can find him on YouTube, ZDoggMD.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.400]   I don't know what his actual real name is.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.000]   Really funny guy, really smart guy, really funny broadcaster.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.760]   But he coined this term alt-middle.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.600]   And I kind of like this terminology.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.760]   So alt-middle is basically an approach
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.920]   where instead of partaking in intellectual groupism, where
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.840]   you say, where's my tribe?
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.720]   What do we believe?
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   Send me the memo.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.200]   Great.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.960]   Who can I tweet at?
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.200]   You approach topics one by one and say,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.280]   let me get into this if it's interesting or relevant to me
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.320]   and I have the time.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.200]   Let me look at people on both sides of it
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.480]   and come up with my own take on it.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.920]   And then-- and this is critical--
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.520]   be willing to change that take if I get better information
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.280]   down the line.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.240]   That hold that position with some empathy
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.120]   and with some contingency.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.880]   I might not quite be right here.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.680]   This is a complicated topic.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.960]   And so I'm going to hold that with some contingency.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.000]   And I'm going to be relatively empathetic to people
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.640]   on other sides.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.000]   Other people aren't evil.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.440]   And that is what he calls the alt-middle approach.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.320]   It really emerged because he's a doctor.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.400]   He does a lot of sort of COVID-centrist type
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.920]   communication.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.880]   He's sort of a COVID-centrist, so one of these people that's
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.080]   very plugged in and mainstream on COVID
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.680]   and understands the science, but also is alarmed by both sides.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.920]   Alarmed, for example, by really extreme anti-vaccination type
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.520]   of discussion.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.320]   Also alarmed by really extreme, we
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.720]   need to lock down the kids and put them in underwater cages
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.200]   because there's a guy who lives six states over who was once
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.920]   immunocompromised type thinking.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.560]   And so through COVID-centrism, he has evolved this idea.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.840]   But I think it could apply to all of intellectual life.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.800]   Alt-middle.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.840]   So ZDogg, I appreciate that terminology.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.040]   Mark, I appreciate you bringing this up.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.680]   Find people who seem reasonable.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.080]   Ask them who the best is.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.040]   Read on both sides of the topic.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.360]   Think for yourself.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.800]   Hold ideas with some contingencies.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.640]   Be empathetic to the other side.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.880]   And trust your moral intuitions.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.680]   You're not going to be tricked into believing something bad.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.320]   Your views are going to get more nuanced.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.120]   Your beliefs are going to get stronger.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.320]   Your ability and motivation to actually make
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.240]   change in the world, which is what actually matters,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.600]   is actually going to be improved when
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.200]   you encounter the very best thinkers
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.920]   on all sides of an issue.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.400]   All right, thanks, Mark.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.160]   Jesse, I showed you ZDogg's--
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.480]   I showed you one of his videos.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.360]   I guess his studio looks very nice.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.920]   I'm jealous.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.520]   So what is it that makes it look nice?
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.960]   It's like a lighting, but--
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.520]   I don't know, it's like a big studio,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.880]   and it's in soft focus or something.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.680]   Yeah, it kind of looks like a really nice yoga studio.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.200]   Now, I don't know if he has a nice camera.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.000]   We have pretty nice cameras.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.040]   Maybe he has an even nicer camera.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.720]   But they're good-looking videos.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.240]   He's also a funny guy.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.960]   I like him.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.760]   ZDoggMD.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.080]   That's such a-- the first name I came up with when I--
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.400]   I bet if we asked him, he's like,
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.640]   I signed up for YouTube on a whim 20 years ago.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.080]   And it was the first name that came to mind,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.520]   and then you're stuck with it.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.760]   It's like when you end up with your email address is
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.800]   like nsyncfan24@aol.com.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.160]   And you're kind of stuck with it because all your family,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   that's the one they know to use.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.040]   I wonder if that's where ZDogg came from.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.960]   (upbeat music)
