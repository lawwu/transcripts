[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   I mean, there's some fundamental, there's some false assumptions about the underlying
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.440]   logic of this process, which I think it's worth addressing.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.080]   And it was actually, it was a kind of found object in the news that I talk about at one
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.560]   point, I forget where it is in the Waking Up app, but there was a story that I stumbled
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.840]   on on the internet, I think it's about 12 or 13 years old, of a tourist bus in, I think
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.640]   it was Norway, it was somewhere in Northern Europe.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.120]   And it had about 30 people on it, and one person was described as an Asian woman, and
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.520]   they went to a rest stop, and everyone got off the bus.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.960]   And they, you know, shopped and had lunch, and this Asian woman changed her clothing,
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960]   for whatever reason.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.440]   And they all got back on the bus.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920]   I think the relevance of it being an Asian woman is that, you know, there were language
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.000]   barriers that explained what later happened.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.760]   So everyone gets back on the bus, the Asian woman has changed her clothing.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.360]   And the bus is about to leave, but then someone notices, hey, there was an Asian woman who
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.520]   got off the bus who hasn't come back yet, and they tell the driver this.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.680]   And this poses a problem, so now everyone's waiting for this person to return.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.320]   But in fact, everyone was on the bus, this woman had just changed her clothing and was
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.240]   not recognized by her fellow travelers.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.640]   So everyone gets concerned as this tourist doesn't, you know, show up, and they start
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.240]   looking for her, right?
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240]   And they can't find her.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.140]   And so a search party is formed.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.440]   And the Asian woman, because of whatever language barrier, heard that there was a missing tourist,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.760]   so she joins the search party, which in fact is looking for her, right?
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.760]   And this goes on into the night, and they're readying helicopters for a dawn patrol to
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.360]   find the missing tourist.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.400]   Now at some point along the way, I think it was at like 3 in the morning, this tourist
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.800]   realizes that she is the object of this search, right?
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.600]   And obviously the whole thing unravels.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.240]   She confesses that she changed her clothes, and, you know, the problem is solved.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.220]   But the problem is not solved by the logic that the seeker is expected, right?
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.480]   So it's like, it's not true to say that the missing tourist was found in the way that
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   was expected, right?
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.040]   Because the missing tourist was never lost.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.880]   The missing tourist was part of the search party, right?
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.920]   And so when you think about it from her point of view, like, what happened?
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.600]   She's part of the search party.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.640]   She's looking for the missing tourist, not knowing that she in fact is the missing tourist.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.200]   So what happens at the moment she realizes that everyone's looking for her, right?
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.440]   Like, what is-- the search isn't consummated in the way that is implied by the logic of
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.920]   everyone's use of attention.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.880]   And yet the problem evaporates.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.800]   And there's something deeply analogous about the structure of that and the meditative journey.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.960]   And precisely in, again, not talking about all the changes and the possible changes in
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.080]   the contents of consciousness that could be good, which, again, they come along for the
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.140]   ride anyway when you do the thing I'm talking about.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.800]   It's on this point of looking for the self and not finding it.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.760]   And there is this sense that, OK, the self is here, and it's a problem.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.520]   It is the string upon which all of my conscious states, mostly unhappy ones, are strung, right?
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.920]   It's the thing that is at the center of my anxiety.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.480]   It's the thing that I don't feel good about.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.300]   It's the thing that when criticized, I sort of let implode.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.720]   It's the center of my problem, and now I'm trying to feel better, and meditation has
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.920]   been handed to me as a possible remedy for my situation.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.120]   And it's billed as a remedy.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.600]   In fact, I'm hearing from this guy that this is the thing that is going to cause me to
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.980]   realize that myself isn't where or as I thought it was.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.600]   So now I'm going to look, right?
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.200]   And so, again, the sense is I start out far away from the goal here.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.080]   I start out with a problem.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.880]   I'm now meditating on the evidence of my unenlightenment, right?
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.040]   I can feel my problem.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.360]   I feel that I'm distracted and distractible, and I feel this sort of cramp at the center
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   of my life.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.760]   It's me, and I'm not as happy as I want to be.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.440]   I'm not as confident as I want to be.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.240]   I'm more distractible than I want to be, and now I'm paying attention to the breath, right?
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.100]   This is what the search party feels like.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.960]   This is what the confused tourist feels like in her own search party.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.880]   And she's looking for the missing person.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:08.640]   And so the angle of, you know, the inclination of all of this is, and the logic of it, is
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.160]   all wrong, you know, understandably so, given how we all get into this situation.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:26.040]   But you know, it's useful to continually try to undercut it and recognize that the thing
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.160]   that's being looked for is actually right on the surface, which is, you know, there
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.560]   is no one looking.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.280]   There is no place from which you are, if you're paying attention to the breath, or to sounds,
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:46.420]   or noticing the next thought arise, the sense that you are over here doing that thing is
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.640]   actually what it's like to be thinking and not knowing that you're thinking.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.180]   There's a thought, there's an undercurrent of thought that's going uninspected in that
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.400]   moment.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.720]   And so there is just a, there's a continually looking for the mind, a looking for the center
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.840]   of experience, a looking for the one who is looking, which again, which is the kind of
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.920]   the orienting practice here.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:16.960]   And there's a lot more I say about this, obviously, over at Waking Up, but it's the experiment
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.980]   you have to perform in order to get ready to recognize that this whole, the search party,
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.120]   you know, was formed in error, essentially.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:34.000]   And the problem that you're trying to solve with this practice does evaporate in a similar
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.760]   way, which is like, you don't actually get there in the way that you're hoping for, right?
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.640]   It's like, like you drop out the bottom of this thing in an unexpected way.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:52.040]   It's not, there's actually another kind of a similar parable or anecdote that I don't
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.360]   remember if it's Zen or Sufi, or, I mean, I'm sure it's been reappropriated in many
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.840]   different ways, but, or by many different traditions.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.920]   But there's this, you know, the case of somebody who's lost in a town and they're asking for
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   directions.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.080]   You know, you could put this in Manhattan, you could, let's say you're wandering Manhattan
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.360]   and you're a tourist, you don't know where anything is.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.380]   And you stop and ask someone, you know, "Where is Central Park?"
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.080]   And the person thinks for a second, they says, "Oh yeah, unfortunately you can't get to Central
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.080]   Park from here."
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   Right?
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.520]   So that is a very strange, I mean, you think about that for a second, you realize, okay,
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   that's a, that's an absurd claim.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.280]   There is no place that you can't get to from the place you're starting, you know, on earth,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.280]   right?
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.040]   It's a failure to describe the physical relationships between anything in the world.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   That's just not the world we live in.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   Right?
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.280]   So, but it's a funny thing, but on some level that is true of meditation.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.120]   It's like, you can't get there from here.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:56.080]   Like the sense of you, the sense of you as subject isn't brought along to this thing
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   you're looking for.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.080]   Right?
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.620]   Like you're like, you're, you know, it's almost like, it's almost like you're, you're making
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.600]   a fist and you're trying to get to an open hand.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.120]   The fist doesn't get to take that journey as a fist.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   Right?
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.720]   Like you don't, the fist doesn't go along for the ride.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.280]   The fist comes apart.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280]   Right?
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.800]   And on some level that our subjectivity is a kind of an intent, an attentional fist.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.480]   You know, it's, it, it is a contraction of energy.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.960]   Again, it's, it's so much bound up in thought for, for most of us, most of the time that
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   is.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:42.040]   And when, when properly inspected, there's just this, you know, evaporation of the starting
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.600]   point, but there's not this, there's not this fulfillment of, I'm going to get this fist
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.040]   is going to, just going to, if I, you know, if life gets good enough, if I get concentrated
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.520]   enough, focused enough, you know, if I austere enough, if I renounce enough, if I desire
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.480]   less, if I, you know, you know, enough with enough good intentions, this fist is going
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.640]   to move into some sort of sublime condition, right?
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:18.280]   That's not the logic of the process.
