[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.240]   the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.240]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.560]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.380]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.700]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.240]   My guest today is Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.640]   And Sam, primarily we're gonna talk today about your book.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.880]   I wanna dig into it,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.640]   as I think this is such a valuable topic.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.400]   Your book is called How to Engineer Your Layoff,
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.560]   Negotiate a Severance and Be Free.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.720]   But before we get to that,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.440]   you have an interesting financial independence
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.000]   and financial freedom story of your own,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.080]   which in my opinion, very much fits the tagline
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.080]   of this show.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.240]   I'd love for you to share a little bit
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.040]   about your career history and how you moved
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.480]   from the place of an employee through the ranks
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.680]   and ultimately wound up becoming financially independent
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.500]   to set the context for our conversation today.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.040]   - Sure, well, thanks for having me on the show.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.880]   It's good to be here.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880]   Financial Samurai started in 2009
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.840]   during the depths of the financial crisis.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.900]   I was actually working in the financial services industry.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.320]   And basically I was losing all my money.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.600]   I thought I did everything right.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.640]   I had a diversified net worth.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.800]   But my net worth was getting pounded,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.600]   just like everybody else, by probably around 35%
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.720]   in a matter of 12 months, really,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.500]   during the depth of the crisis.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.280]   So I started Financial Samurai
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.200]   just to try to make sense of all the chaos.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.360]   My career started in 1999.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.860]   I graduated from college then.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.640]   I joined an investment bank in New York City.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.360]   And I was in the equities department,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.480]   which is basically sales and trading,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.280]   stocks, all that good stuff.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.440]   And I knew from the very first month of work
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.520]   when I had to get in by 5.30 a.m.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.440]   And I'd have to leave probably around 7.30, 8 p.m.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.340]   'cause I had to deal with the international markets
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.400]   that I don't think I would've been able to last very long.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.720]   So I was like, well, there's no way
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.860]   after one month of doing this
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.360]   where I'm gonna survive for probably
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.260]   more than five to 10 years.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.240]   So I better save my money aggressively now.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.680]   So it was pretty interesting.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.080]   It was ironic because I think that a lot of people,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.040]   if they have a nice job, cushy, nine to five,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.240]   not a lot of stress, not a lot of demands
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.880]   from clients and all that pressure,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.680]   I think the desire for financial independence early
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.400]   is not really there.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.840]   But if you just get pounded and beat by a stick
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.660]   every single morning from very, very intense people,
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.780]   you wanna get the hell out as soon as possible.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.200]   So that was my thought from the very first month of work.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   I had to get out, so I saved as much as I could,
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.240]   like at least 50% of my income.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   I lived in a studio with a buddy of mine for two years.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.760]   And just to try to save, save, save.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.240]   And I would actually kind of welcome
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.800]   the seven o'clock time period
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.760]   because I could get some free dinner at my company.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.880]   (laughing)
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.700]   - Did you find that others of your compatriots,
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.160]   new entrants into the investment banking world,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.680]   were following a similar path and saving a lot of money?
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.960]   Or did you find that they were a little bit
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.820]   more liberal with their spending?
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   - I think a lot of people would go out in New York City,
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.200]   you'd go to the clubs, you'd go spend on drinks, food.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.760]   There's an endless amount of things
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.720]   to spend money on in Manhattan.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.540]   It's just an amazing place with a lot of,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.080]   I don't think you can ever feel too rich in New York City,
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.320]   let's just put it that way.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   So I think a lot of people did enjoy,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.800]   once you get a paycheck, you wanna blow it on and stuff.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.040]   But I just didn't take that route.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.680]   I mean, my parents were always pretty frugal.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.560]   Really middle class citizens.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.760]   We lived in a townhouse when I was in high school.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.840]   I went to a public high school and a public college
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.640]   because I was pretty aware that I didn't wanna
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.320]   burden my parents and frankly myself
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.740]   on paying private school tuition.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.160]   And I knew that, so I went to the College of William
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.740]   and Mary in Virginia and the tuition there
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.400]   was about $2,800 a year.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.000]   And contrary to the tuition my parents paid for my sister,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.680]   that was about $20,000 a year.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.080]   And so I knew that worst case,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.920]   if I'd gone to a public school,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.220]   if I ended up without a job, with nothing,
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.680]   I could just go back and work at McDonald's
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.160]   and pay my parents back 2,800 bucks.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   So I really had this kind of frugal mindset
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.840]   and hyper-awareness of our financial situation
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.880]   since I was probably 13, 14.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.240]   - In working in stressful industries like you're describing,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.700]   especially investment banking,
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.440]   I think it's great that it pushed you in that direction,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.800]   but I don't know how we would confirm
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.520]   whether it does that for other people or not.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.400]   It seems to me like it could have that benefit.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.800]   It could be a blessing in disguise and demonstrate to you,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.280]   hey, I don't wanna do this, so I need to plan to get out.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.800]   But generally, the mindset that I've observed
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.820]   around investment banking, people who go into it
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.320]   are focused on the million, two million,
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.880]   three million plus a year payday at the end,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.800]   once they get established,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.000]   once they do a couple of big deals.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.040]   And so they're looking at the grunt work
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.700]   as just simply the price of tuition
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.480]   to where they can get into the position
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.000]   of earning the big money.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.400]   And oftentimes, people who are motivated
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.520]   by earning the big money,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.280]   seems to me like they're motivated
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.840]   by earning the big money to sell and, excuse me, to spend
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.240]   and live that million bucks a year lifestyle.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.060]   And so they can easily get sucked into the world
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.160]   of putting all of their money into appearances
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.640]   in the early days to meet that.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.040]   I didn't work in investment banking,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.280]   but I also worked in financial services,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.480]   but on the retail side,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.400]   working as a retail financial advisor.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.480]   And I always felt that pressure where it was hard.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.720]   Similar, I worked similar work schedule to yours
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.640]   in terms of a 12 to 16 hour day was not uncommon.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.660]   And although it was in a different context,
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.160]   one of the temptations I often felt was,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.560]   well, I'll always make more money in the future.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.060]   This is a highly lucrative business,
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.000]   so everything's gonna work out fine.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.760]   It's okay to just go ahead and spend now.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.600]   And by the way, if I spend now and buy a fancy car
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.100]   and wear fancy clothes and engage in fancy activities,
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.020]   I'm paving the path to where I need to be
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.160]   so that I can make the big money in the future.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.320]   I'll fit in at the country club,
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.360]   I'll be able to integrate with all of these rich people.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.800]   And so my guess would be that that temptation is there
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.300]   in investment banking as well.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.580]   - I think there's a perception issue
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.660]   with Wall Street and Main Street.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.140]   One of the perceptions is that I think everybody
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.620]   is making the million to $3 million.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.680]   And that's just not true.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.660]   Maybe only the managing directors
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.540]   will start making a million dollars.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.800]   And to get to managing director,
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.900]   I would think the median time frame to get there
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.260]   is 10 years of service at least.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.060]   Or maybe not, maybe that's the median,
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.900]   10 to 15 years of service,
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.500]   whether out of undergrad or business school.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.860]   And I would say maybe half a percent of the people
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.660]   actually get to that level.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.540]   So just to clarify,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.260]   not everybody's making the million bucks.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.180]   I mean, people will start off with pretty good salaries,
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.280]   but they're much less.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.980]   In terms of the temptation,
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.300]   I definitely saw a lot of wealthy people.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.260]   My firm, we went public in 1999,
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.420]   and suddenly a lot of the managing directors there
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.920]   were worth multi-millions of dollars.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.660]   But I think what happened was
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.340]   I saw the people around me with a lot of money,
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.620]   and I didn't see them to be any happier.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.820]   I just felt that they had put in their dues.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.860]   They were much older, they were in their 40s and 50s,
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.060]   and they were wealthier, so that made a lot of sense.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.700]   So the culture of the firm really instilled in us
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.140]   to pay our dues, to not expect to go straight
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.620]   to the corner office once we get in,
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.280]   but to say, look, there is a really strong meritocracy,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.000]   and so if you do work hard,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.500]   you do kill yourself for 15 hours a day,
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.100]   you do build a proper support network,
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.860]   you too might be able to ascend.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.980]   So it was like always a decision.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.680]   Oh, it's there for me,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.620]   which is I think all anybody really wants,
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.340]   to be able to have a strong correlation
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.340]   with effort and performance and reward.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.260]   But I don't know, I didn't see people as much happier,
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.260]   and I enjoyed when someone invited me to a party,
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.420]   or went for a ride, or whatever, that was nice.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.220]   But I don't know, it was just never in me
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.660]   that I had to make the megabucks
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.460]   to live the high lifestyle.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.140]   I think I would rather have just been happy
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.980]   being a fitter person with good health
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.540]   and having a lot more freedom.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.640]   - So continue please to paint the arc of your career for us.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.500]   - So '99 to 2001, New York City,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.740]   the dot-com bubble started to collapse in 2000.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.100]   And in 2001, I knew,
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.160]   I don't think I would have been able to survive at my firm,
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.820]   and a headhunter called one of my VPs,
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.360]   and she said, oh, I'm not interested in moving,
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.740]   but maybe you wanna talk to Sam.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.900]   So I was like, okay, I'll talk.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.980]   And so it was a competing firm in San Francisco,
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.020]   doing the same thing, Asian equities,
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.840]   which was pretty cool because the Asian markets
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   are really growing by leaps and bounds,
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.780]   especially China in the early 2000s.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.980]   And so I talked to the headhunter,
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.660]   and I said, hey, you know what?
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.260]   I don't think I'm gonna be able to survive
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.900]   at my firm in New York City.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.180]   The layoffs are coming, I just took a chance,
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.940]   I took a leap of faith to go to San Francisco
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.860]   where I knew nobody, and to try to do something new.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.860]   And so I never thought I would last
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.860]   in the investment banking arena for as long as I did,
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.420]   but being able to move to San Francisco,
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.140]   be with new people, have a different type of lifestyle,
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.380]   and work at a different firm really invigorated
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.260]   my desire and my career in finance.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.180]   So I lasted until 2012, in which I ultimately
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.140]   engineered my layoff to do something else.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.780]   - And since that time, you've essentially
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.720]   considered yourself to be financially independent.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.240]   I know you've done some work and have pursued
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.740]   various sources of income, but when you
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.580]   engineered your layoff in 2012, did you feel like
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.300]   at that point in time you had reached financial independence?
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.420]   - Yes, I did.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.700]   2012, let's see, four and a half years ago,
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.460]   I was, yeah, 34 and a half.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.740]   And what happened was I had been starting
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.660]   to build passive income and saving, investing
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.700]   since about 2000, like January 2000,
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.760]   when I first got my stub bonus from four months
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.260]   of work in 1999, because I wanted to get out.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.460]   I knew I needed to have the optionality
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.780]   to get out because I just didn't think I would last.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.860]   My parents lasted for multiple decades,
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.260]   and traditionally retired in their 60s.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.780]   I just didn't think I could last,
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.700]   and I didn't know what else I could do.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.100]   So by 2012, I had developed a passive income
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.900]   stream of about $80,000.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.220]   And I knew that about 80,000, this was gross,
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.500]   was good enough to not starve in San Francisco.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.100]   San Francisco's obviously a really expensive place to live,
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.260]   but I had locked down my mortgage,
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.880]   and I had been tracking about anywhere
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.820]   from 70 to $80,000 a year gross income and spending anyway.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.940]   So I felt, you know what, $80,000 was enough
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.100]   of a passive income stream where I felt
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.360]   it would cover all my expenses and maintain
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.140]   the lifestyle I had in San Francisco.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:04.140]   Meanwhile, I had started my site, Financial Samurai, in 2009
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.460]   and it started making a little bit of money here and there,
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.540]   which I never collected.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.580]   It was just siphoned off and given to someone else
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.300]   because I didn't want to have any conflicts of interest.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.940]   So I knew with Financial Samurai and the $80,000
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.020]   passive income, I would survive.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.020]   So but my biggest fear of leaving was,
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.860]   well there's two things.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.980]   One was giving up my deferred compensation
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.080]   in terms of cash and stock, which was gonna get paid out
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.700]   over a three year time period.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.780]   And there was also some partner investments
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.660]   that were made during the financial crisis,
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.660]   which we paid out in 2017, believe it or not.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.220]   And then my other main fear was that if I left,
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.740]   I'd look like an idiot, and people would think
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.580]   I'd just be totally stupid to throw away a 13 year career
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.620]   making what I was making.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.140]   And that I would fail because there would be no correlation
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.620]   with the effort I put into Financial Samurai and the reward.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.820]   That was my, frankly my biggest fear,
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.500]   that I would try and nothing would happen.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.820]   - Right, right.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.900]   Now, two things that I want to emphasize
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.460]   as we get to the layoff process,
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.220]   is first in what you just sketched out.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.540]   You and your story is an example of one of the themes
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.540]   that I discuss on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.460]   that it is possible in a decade or so,
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.560]   to build a plan for financial independence.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.260]   And as you described that if you began building
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.020]   passive income in 2001,
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.220]   and you entered into the workforce in 1999,
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.660]   you saved and worked towards that end.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.260]   And in 2012, you considered yourself to be
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.580]   financially independent with an $80,000 a year
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.100]   passive income stream.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.300]   So that's about a decade and a half.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.420]   And so it is possible to do.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.140]   And since then you've gone on to build more.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.140]   And there was no magic secret to it.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.100]   You saved aggressively, you made wise investments,
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.420]   and you worked hard and built your career.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.680]   So I think it's a great, it's an important story
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.340]   for people to recognize that it is possible.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.580]   Before I go on to the second point,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.140]   have you had people, I mean,
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.860]   do you feel like you've gotten that message out there
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.460]   in the things that you've written to demonstrate
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.420]   that yes, you can with a career, with frugality?
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.740]   I mean, you were riding a bus to work,
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.100]   even though you're working as a high dollar investment
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.740]   as an employee in the financial services industry.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.120]   Have you gotten that message out there enough, do you feel?
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.380]   - I think so.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.420]   I started tracking my passive income progress,
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.740]   and I would do it once a year.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.100]   And I think through tracking the progress,
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.900]   and just telling my mistakes and my wins,
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.180]   people just kind of got the message,
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.300]   oh, it can be done, but it's not an easy and quick path.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.900]   So if I started in January 2000,
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.820]   and I finally left in 2012 to get $80,000 in passive income,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.700]   that's 12 years to get to 80,000.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.840]   I saved 100% on all my bonuses,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.420]   and then I saved even more, I maxed out my 401k,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.400]   I lived in a studio, and then I lived in this really crappy
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.320]   two bedroom, one bath apartment at the edge of Chinatown.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.120]   You know, there were sacrifices to be made.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.680]   And then I went to business school part-time
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.760]   to try to accelerate my career as well,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.960]   during the 60 to 70 hour work week grind.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.160]   The thing that people need to realize is that
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.000]   10, 15 years ago, everybody could easily get
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.640]   around a 4% risk-free rate of return,
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.400]   either through the 10 year bond yield or a CD.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.880]   But now, interest rates, the 10 year bond yield
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.120]   has gone down to under 2%.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.040]   So it actually takes even more effort
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.700]   to generate that passive income.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.960]   So throughout the years, I talk about this,
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.840]   and I think people really kind of get the math behind it,
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.280]   the economics and the importance of looking at
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.360]   different types of investments to boost that income
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.140]   in a risk-adjusted manner.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.480]   - One thing I've appreciated over the years,
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.440]   because of your background in the investment markets
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.280]   and the financial services industry,
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.560]   your website features a level of sophistication
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.240]   when discussing markets, market sectors,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.480]   appropriate diversification of a portfolio
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.320]   that's often lacking in personal finance websites.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.560]   You don't just give the approach,
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.680]   put it all in an index fund, it's gonna be okay.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.160]   You look at CD rates, you keep cash on the side,
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.040]   you discuss what the risk-free rate is,
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.680]   you discuss how various things are affecting,
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.980]   you discuss your portfolio where you're shooting
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:36.080]   for big wins, but you also discuss the conservative base
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.040]   and I really appreciate that about your writing.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.280]   I wanna talk about layoffs now.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.880]   And the first thing that I wanna mention
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.120]   is the timing of the layoff.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.440]   Now, in your story, I've picked up that you went
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.820]   to San Francisco because you were concerned
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.680]   about being laid off, but then while you were
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.080]   in San Francisco many years later,
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.480]   you engineered a layoff.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.360]   This can be a challenge because in some cases,
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.480]   getting laid off is a benefit.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.800]   And in a moment, I want you to talk about the benefits.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.840]   One of the biggest is severance, just different things.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.700]   There are a lot of benefits to getting laid off,
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.700]   but one of the major disadvantages could be that
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.240]   in being laid off, you might be perceived
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.720]   as not a valuable employee, depending on the market,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.960]   depending on the industry, and also you could be getting
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.300]   laid off at the wrong time in the market cycle.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.560]   In some cases, if you perceive that layoffs are coming,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.840]   it's better to be an early mover and leave
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.520]   and go ahead and get a job while you don't have
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.360]   a lot of competition.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.160]   So talk about even the timing and the advisability
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.820]   of working to engineer a layoff for yourself
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.400]   versus moving quickly and going ahead and quitting
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.320]   and moving on to something else.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.440]   - Right, so you make some good points.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.360]   To be able to engineer your layoff takes a lot
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.580]   of self-awareness and just awareness
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.960]   about your surroundings.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   So in 2008 to 2010, it was a horrific time
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.880]   for I think most investors and just most Americans.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.760]   There was a lot of uncertainty in their investments.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.560]   A lot of their friends were getting laid off.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.000]   My firm had four to six rounds of layoff
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.140]   in 2008, 2009, and 2010.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.120]   So someone who is self-aware recognizes
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.260]   there's trouble ahead.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.280]   And for myself, the reason why I wanted
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.240]   to engineer my layoff was two things.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.920]   One, the financial services industry
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.860]   became public enemy number one.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.160]   Even though I had nothing to do with the mortgage
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.040]   financial crisis, with someone not paying their mortgage
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.960]   or whatnot, it didn't matter.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.920]   I was the bad person.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.280]   And that didn't feel good.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.600]   I felt I was a good person.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.120]   My mom always told me I was a good person
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.720]   and I'm trying to help people and serve as clients.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.400]   So that was one thing.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.040]   And then the second thing was there was a lack
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.280]   of correlation with effort and reward anymore.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.000]   I had done well in my business,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.440]   but I was being asked to subsidize the departments
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.280]   that didn't do well.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.400]   And I understood that, because it's one team, one dream.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.060]   There's good and the bad, and we have to be in it together.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.040]   But instead of complaining or just feeling down,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.480]   I just said, you know what?
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.040]   That's totally fine, I get it.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.720]   But I would rather not complain
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.680]   and I would rather work something out.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.080]   So when you want to engineer your layout,
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.900]   you need to be serious about your desire to move on.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.880]   Okay, this is a proactive step everybody must take.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.600]   This is not a reactionary, oh my gosh,
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.720]   come to the HR department office.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.820]   Oh my gosh, I'm getting laid off.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.800]   Pack your bags, see you later.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.760]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.360]   The way I've been writing and thinking and advising people
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.480]   is to really be proactive in thinking ahead
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.840]   about what could happen.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.200]   Create some scenarios in your mind.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.060]   Be very methodical and analytical
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.440]   about your future and about your finances.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.680]   So I knew for myself that the pay
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.000]   was never gonna be as it was.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.100]   I knew that I would continue to subsidize other departments.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.000]   And I knew that I had a different interest in my life,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.680]   which was writing online and building Financial Samurai.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   I just loved it, whereas I no longer love
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.340]   the financial services industry.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.280]   And so to take that step is to be aware
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.520]   that there are layoffs, there were layoffs,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.640]   and there are layoffs to come.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.840]   And one of the steps that I recommend everybody do
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.640]   who works in a larger company is to simply Google
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.480]   the WARN Act, W-A-R-N Act,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.200]   because companies of larger size,
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.760]   generally it's 1,000 or more,
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.480]   will have to file with their local, with the state,
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.020]   to warn the state that they're gonna do mass layoffs.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.080]   And if you see your company on that list,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:04.040]   then you know, okay, a layoff is coming.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.760]   So what you wanna do is be proactive
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.680]   if you have decided that you wanna do something else,
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.400]   is to try to get on that list
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.440]   and be first on that layoff list,
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.880]   because the people first will get the most benefits
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.640]   and the people last will get the least.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.200]   - Obviously the advice of how to get laid off
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.000]   is counterintuitive.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.120]   Most people are saying how not to get laid off.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.960]   In fact, I've done a series of shows
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.320]   on how to not get fired in the coming recession.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   So make the case as to why I would actually want
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.960]   to be laid off and why I would want to be laid off
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.240]   in an early round if possible.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.120]   - Sure, so in the past, like perhaps our parents
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.880]   or our parents' parents, they would have pensions.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.600]   They would work until 60, 65,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.440]   and then they would get a pension for life
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.280]   and be set for life.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.460]   So they didn't actually really have to save.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.120]   Whereas now we have to save through our 401k, our IRA.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.240]   The company match average is only like 3%
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.120]   of your contribution or your salary.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.040]   So it's really not that good.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.880]   So the onus has been put on us
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.080]   to take care of ourselves financially.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.320]   Sure, there will be Social Security.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.040]   I believe at least 70% of the payout
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.960]   from Social Security will be available to us
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.700]   when we retire for those under 40, 45.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.440]   But it's not something to count on.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.480]   So why do we want to engineer our layoff?
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.800]   There's a couple things.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.920]   One, you know there's something else better you wanna do.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.480]   In my case, it was I already built $80,000
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.000]   in passive income over the past 12 years
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.880]   and I had something to do,
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.040]   which was write on Financial Samurai.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.720]   The other case might be you just,
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.500]   you hate your job and you wanna find a new job.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.320]   But a lot of people will say, you know what,
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.520]   they think that the honorable thing to do
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.440]   or the easy way is to just quit
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.280]   or give their two weeks notice.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.500]   And I think that is the absolute wrong way.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.320]   You should never quit.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.260]   You should always get laid.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.100]   That's the tagline.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.220]   Never quit, get laid.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.240]   And the other idea is,
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.040]   getting laid is much better than quitting.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.880]   And then there's this whole other movement
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.240]   we hear online about people who want to travel the world
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.520]   and do all this kind of stuff or whatever.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.400]   That's great.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.760]   But no time in our history is now
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.920]   have so many people been able to choose
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.040]   what they wanna do in their lives.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.380]   Like 100, 200 years ago, people had to farm,
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.220]   had to do whatever.
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.200]   They were just stuck.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.720]   So these are some reasons
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.880]   why you wanna engineer your layout.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.800]   And the other thing is,
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.240]   let's say you've been a relatively low employee,
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.300]   been there for five to 10 years.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.360]   Let's say you work at a startup.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.800]   And startups, they pay stock over time.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.360]   You get vested over usually a three to four year period.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.120]   If you quit, you get none of that.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.640]   If you're a long-term employee
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.920]   at an investment bank, for example,
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.800]   you have deferred cash and stock as well
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.720]   because nobody pays you all cash anymore.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.900]   If you get laid off, here are some of the benefits.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.240]   One, you might get a severance.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   A severance, let me be clear, is it's discretionary.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.280]   You must negotiate that severance.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.920]   A lot of great firms have already
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.920]   a standard boilerplate severance package.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.080]   Maybe it might be one to three weeks per year worked.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:26.200]   Second benefit, you get WARN Act pay, W-A-R-N Act pay.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.360]   So the law states that if you're gonna do a mass layoff,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.120]   you must pay the employee
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.440]   either one to three months worth of pay,
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.340]   and then you can pay someone their severance as well.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.200]   The other benefit is you can get COBRA in healthcare
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.040]   for anywhere from three to six to 12 months.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.440]   And it can be fully paid by your company
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.600]   or you just basically pay your normal premiums.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.640]   And that's really important,
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.400]   especially for people who have a gap
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.680]   in what they plan to do in between their job or whatever.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.140]   The other benefit is you can get unemployment benefits.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.200]   If you are laid off,
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.680]   you have a right to unemployment benefits.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.800]   Unemployment benefits, I think in California, for example,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.760]   are $900 every two weeks or $1,800 a month.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.000]   And you can receive that, as you can in most states,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.620]   for 26 weeks.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.240]   There's no more, I think, federal unemployment benefits
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.780]   as there once was during the crisis
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.320]   where you heard about the 99 weeks.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.200]   But again, this is another nice cushion
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.560]   for you during your transition period.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.560]   Because if anybody who's ever been laid off, fired, or quit
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.640]   knows the transition period between jobs
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.080]   is a really disconcerting and stressful time.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.960]   So the whole idea of how to engineer your layoff
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.980]   is to be very analytical, practical,
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.980]   and to build the longest financial runway possible
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.660]   until you discover something
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.020]   that you really, really wanna do.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.720]   Too many people leave something
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.360]   and because of financial uncertainty,
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.880]   they panic and then they say,
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.840]   I'm gonna take the first thing that comes to me.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.680]   And then they go in this endless cycle
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.600]   of doing something they don't like to do just for money.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.480]   - Tell you a quick comment on that 99 week thing.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.000]   That was an incredible time.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.600]   I had one client who had transferred
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   their 401k account to my stewardship.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   But this client spent the entire 99 weeks traveling
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.640]   and just living off of the unemployment benefits.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.480]   - Oh, there you go.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.160]   - Took a two year vacation on the government dime.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.560]   It was remarkable to see.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.340]   - But one thing people need to be aware of
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.360]   is that the company pays
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.720]   into the unemployment benefit system.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   So as a company owner now, I pay a percentage of my wages
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.880]   and someone else's wages into the unemployment system.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.960]   Therefore, people need to recognize
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.320]   that it's not just free money.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.280]   They've actually paid into it, just like Social Security.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.560]   - Right.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.360]   So did we finish your list of benefits?
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.080]   You said big reason, severance.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.120]   You can get severance, Warrant Act pay,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.860]   COBRA and healthcare paid by the company,
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.360]   which that can be an extremely substantial benefit,
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.760]   especially given that those premiums
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.480]   that can be paid for you,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.700]   you're not generally gonna be paying tax
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.160]   on the cost of those premiums.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.080]   And then number four would be--
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.560]   - Unemployment benefits.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.000]   Anything else on the reasons to consider getting laid off?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.720]   - And then of course, if you have deferred cash
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.080]   or stock compensation or stuff like that,
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.040]   that gets lost 100% if you quit.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.400]   But if you get laid off,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   think about it as an act of kindness from the company to you
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.200]   where they will let your unvested stock and cash
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.080]   vest over the schedule
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.640]   that if you were still employed with them.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.360]   - Now Sam, you're coming at this from the perspective
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.280]   of the financial industry,
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.960]   where you had six figure white collar salaries,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.720]   you have complex deferred compensation,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.880]   bonus programs, incentive programs, things like that.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.360]   How applicable is this advice or approach
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.040]   to somebody who's more of a blue collar worker?
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.000]   Someone's a drywall hanger
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.440]   and their company construction industry starts to decline
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.920]   and they're gonna go in and they know that,
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.240]   well, the boss is gonna be laying us off
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   because business is down.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.040]   Are these strategies applicable to that type of worker?
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.240]   - It is.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.760]   And I start off the book by talking about
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.480]   relationship building,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.040]   developing a high emotional quotient.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.280]   Engineering your layoff
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.800]   is about building strong enough relationships
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.600]   so when the time comes,
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.680]   you can have an honest and frank conversation
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.800]   about why you wanna get laid off.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.800]   Turn it around and think about it
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.320]   from a manager's perspective.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.720]   And I think maybe most people are non-managers,
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.200]   just by the numbers,
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.720]   but I can tell you as a manager of several people
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.280]   in my previous career
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.240]   and by speaking to other managers and leaders at a company,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.920]   laying someone off is one of the most difficult things
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.520]   someone can do.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.800]   It doesn't even really matter
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.880]   if the person was a real pain in the ass while at work.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   To be able to tell someone to their face,
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.440]   I'm sorry, your services are no longer needed,
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.080]   is brutal.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.680]   Think about breaking up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.080]   or just telling anybody some bad news.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.440]   Telling people bad news is brutal.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.480]   So one of the strategies I talk about in the book
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.200]   is how you wanna cultivate the relationships you have
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.560]   with the decision makers, with HR,
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.520]   and be aware that maybe the business is not doing so well
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.840]   or be aware that impending layoffs are coming
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.920]   to take the step to actually help alleviate a manager
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.080]   or an HR personnel's stress and fears
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.200]   about laying someone off by saying,
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.320]   "Hey, let's have a discussion
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.920]   "because I'm thinking about doing something else."
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   You don't need to choose who to lay off.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.520]   I can be the one.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.560]   I can save you the grief and the misery
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.400]   of telling someone the bad news.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.080]   But let's work out a plan.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.960]   Let me stay on for the next three months
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.320]   to help train someone to be my replacement,
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.920]   if that is necessary,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.160]   or let me do whatever it is you want me to do
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.000]   so that I can get laid off with that severance,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.320]   with those benefits, so I can move on.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   Because no manager wants someone
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   who doesn't wanna be there either.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.360]   So it's a real win-win scenario that you can create.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.880]   But a lot of people just have this tremendous fear,
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   it's like David and Goliath,
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.360]   that the corporation, the manager,
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.000]   he or she is untouchable, they have lawyers, all that.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.400]   What people also need to realize,
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.120]   besides the difficulty that managers have laying people off,
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.480]   is that any corporation has a reputation to protect.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   The larger the reputation, the more at risk things are.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.520]   So think about it this way.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.640]   And again, you have to be aware,
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.160]   how much does your company make?
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.520]   How many employees does it have?
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.680]   Where it is in the cycle?
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.320]   You know, there was this one article,
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.440]   or one New York Times expose
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.640]   about this disgruntled Goldman Sachs employee
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.520]   who said, "Why I left Goldman Sachs."
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.760]   And he just went straight to the New York Times
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.720]   to blow them up.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.720]   And that caused a tremendous amount of headache
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.080]   for the company, bad PR,
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.520]   they probably had a more difficult time hiring people,
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.280]   winning deals, all people were talking about
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.960]   was the reputation.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.680]   You know, in retrospect, all the company had to do
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.520]   was probably say, "Here, here's half a million dollars,
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.920]   "or a million dollars,"
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.800]   to save themselves a lot of heartache.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.080]   Just be aware that company reputation is everything now.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.080]   Reputation is everything to individual and to a company.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.460]   And if you can be more proactive and strategic
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.120]   in talking to your managers,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.360]   and building those relationships, good things will happen.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.280]   - The first thing that I think of
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.840]   when somebody says how to engineer your layoff
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.680]   without reading your book,
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.080]   just simply considering a question like that,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.200]   would be, "Okay, I'm gonna start showing up to work late,
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.080]   "I'm gonna start being a jerk around the office,
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.520]   "I'm gonna make people not like me,
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.520]   "I'm gonna be flaky and not produce on my work, et cetera.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.540]   "And that way I'm gonna go ahead
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.440]   "and become a non-valued employee
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.040]   "and I'm gonna get laid off."
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.280]   But what you're describing,
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.320]   the approach you're describing is not that.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.360]   It's very different.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.560]   - Yeah, I mean, you can take two approaches.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.520]   You can take a more honorable approach, I guess,
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.880]   which is the way I talk about being aware,
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.720]   having an open discussion about why it is
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.240]   you wanna move on,
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.580]   but creating a win-win scenario as to how you move on.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.880]   And I do talk about in the book,
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.760]   the strategies on creating or planting seeds of doubt
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.400]   in your manager's mind about whether you
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.360]   are the right employee to remain for the next one, two,
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.320]   long-term years.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.560]   And so, yeah, you can definitely start showing up late.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.480]   You can definitely take all your sick leave,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.040]   all your vacation days, which you should,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.820]   but the culture in America is that you shouldn't.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.280]   And you can do all sorts of stuff.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.960]   But I really wanna emphasize
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.620]   that there is a better way to do it,
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.120]   which is to really focus on life,
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.660]   focus on your family,
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.920]   you focus on the health of your parents.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.680]   One strategy a reader wrote into me,
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.280]   and I published a post on my site,
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.480]   by the name of Samurai,
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.560]   is using the Family and Medical Leave Act
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.140]   as a way to plant that seed of doubt,
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.760]   or to make the manager aware that,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.280]   hey, you know what?
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.680]   Joe or Jack or Jill has other things going on,
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.320]   and actually laying them off
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.960]   might actually be a benefit to both of us,
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.800]   because if they're gonna take
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.320]   the Family and Medical Leave Act,
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.440]   they're gonna be gone for three months,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.120]   or whatever, maybe we can have a discussion
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.640]   where we just kind of lay them off
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.240]   so that there's no gaping hole during the three months,
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.760]   and we can move on and hire their replacement.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   - How big of a factor do you think
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.680]   personal situations are versus market conditions?
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.200]   Let's pretend that I'm working at a job,
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.060]   and I recognize that I am,
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.120]   this job is not a good fit for me,
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.160]   I've got something else I wanna pursue,
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.240]   and thus I'd like to go ahead and leave this company,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.760]   but I don't wanna just walk in and quit
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.720]   for the reasons that we discussed.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.360]   But I also don't see any headwinds on the horizon,
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.320]   our company's booming,
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.520]   and they're not laying people off, they're hiring.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.240]   Is it possible, or do you have any ideas or strategies
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.360]   to engineer a layoff in that circumstance,
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.400]   or do we need to be facing headwinds of some kind,
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.420]   such that the managers and leaders of the company
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.120]   are considering layoffs?
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.960]   - All right.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.760]   This is a good question,
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.800]   a lot of people who are skeptical of the strategy
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.200]   think, "Well, why would they lay me off?
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.380]   "I'm such a great employee and star contributor," right?
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.920]   But if you're already asking how to engineer a layoff,
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.700]   your heart and your mind is somewhere else,
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.720]   you wanna do something else.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.040]   And I think most people realize a job is a job,
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.080]   and I would think, the surveys say more than 50%,
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.000]   maybe 70% of the people are not engaged at work,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.840]   they wanna do something else,
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.280]   they're not doing what they really wanna do.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.480]   So do we need headwinds?
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.600]   No, but headwinds help because it makes it easier, right?
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.320]   There is a layoff coming, okay, good layoff.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.600]   Let me participate.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.600]   But any good company constantly is calling
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.640]   kind of the bottom five to 10%,
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.960]   and it's kind of like the Jack Welch at GE way.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.240]   They're trying to figure out ways
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.160]   to always improve productivity
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.960]   and upgrade their employees, all that stuff.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.600]   So know that even in the most booming times,
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.080]   there are always people that management
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.800]   is looking to lay off and to upgrade.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.000]   And no manager, again, wants an employee
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.960]   whose heart and mind is not in their jobs,
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.960]   especially if it's a hyper-competitive environment,
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.920]   like whether it's tech, internet, banking,
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.680]   consulting, startup, whatever,
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.320]   it's all focus, focus, focus, give me everything you got.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.760]   So if you don't wanna be there,
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.200]   they don't want you to be there.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.280]   But I think the best strategy in a good environment
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.960]   is to really utilize personal reasons
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.400]   that everybody can relate to.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.520]   And those personal reasons are things
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.180]   such as the health of your aging parents.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:55.480]   It can be your spouse and how she gave up her career
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.320]   to be with you in San Francisco or New York City,
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:03.000]   but she is from Austin, Texas.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.640]   And how you wanna do the right thing
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.680]   and now do some sacrifice for her instead.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.840]   These are the things that any manager
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.400]   and any person, decision maker,
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.040]   regarding your promotion or your layoff
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.540]   can empathize with because he or she also has parents,
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.260]   significant others, and family.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:29.060]   And everybody knows that, I think, family's first.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:34.060]   So utilizing your family and other more, I think,
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.400]   noble reasons for why you want to move on
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.360]   is a great way to start the discussion.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.560]   - So pretend for a moment that you were doing
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.280]   personal coaching of some kind.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   You had a friend that came to you and said,
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.160]   "Sam, I've got some of these personal reasons.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.280]   "My parents are aging and I feel like
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.620]   "I've neglected my kids.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.540]   "I really would like to have a different situation.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.040]   "But these circumstances are pressing in
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   "and I can start this process.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.520]   "But I don't know how long it's gonna take."
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.040]   If you were coaching somebody,
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.920]   I know that you couldn't be,
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.520]   I don't think you would make the claim
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.960]   that you could get anybody laid off.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.220]   I think this is a strategy that can work some of the time
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.960]   and you can work it with the hopes that it'll work.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.040]   But my guess would be,
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.320]   feel free to disagree in a moment if you see differently.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.960]   My guess would be you wouldn't make any kind of claim
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.640]   that this is absolutely doable by all people.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.400]   This is one of those things that you can work at
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.720]   and there are a lot of benefits if you can get it,
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.320]   but it may not work and ultimately you might have to quit.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.800]   But with regard to timing,
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.100]   if I came to you and you were coaching me
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.400]   and I gave you a scenario like I just did,
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.080]   could you give me an idea of how long you would guess
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.720]   it would take or that I would need
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.800]   to be able to start to make progress
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.160]   toward my goal of getting laid off?
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.880]   Is this something that I could make happen in a month,
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.520]   in a year, in five years?
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.200]   What kind of time scale are we talking about?
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.280]   - Yeah, so two things.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.080]   Time scale and the feasibility of engineering your layoff.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.200]   Let's talk about the feasibility
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.920]   of engineering your layoff first.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.760]   People need to not be confused with the terms
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.960]   getting fired and getting laid off.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.800]   Getting fired is through cause,
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.000]   such as sexually harassing a colleague,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.040]   punching your manager in the face,
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.080]   stealing company secrets, all that stuff.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.560]   That is grounds for getting fired.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.440]   And when you get fired,
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   you can get like a black mark on your record,
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.200]   especially in the finance industry.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:37.020]   Getting laid off is a benevolent term.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.000]   It is through really no fault of your own.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.160]   Usually it's through company-wide layoffs,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.720]   a change or a shutting down of a department and so forth.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   Yes, there are circumstances where people who are laid off
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.280]   might be because of underperformance,
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.080]   but please recognize that companies
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.480]   who wisely follow protocol
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.660]   basically have records,
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.640]   you have your six-month review,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.600]   your quarterly review, whatever.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.440]   To be able to get laid off,
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.960]   you have to have a consistent record of underperformance.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.440]   And so unless you're completely clueless,
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.240]   and this goes back to being aware, self-aware,
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.680]   you kind of know that the writing is on the wall.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.060]   So in terms of feasibility,
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.080]   I think the feasibility is very high,
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.360]   and it's much higher than getting promoted
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.440]   to president of the company or whatever,
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.440]   because you cannot get fired without cause.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.400]   And if you start slacking off at work and all that,
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.120]   you will probably eventually get laid off,
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.040]   but that's kind of due to your lack of performance.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:53.440]   But the idea is you can get laid off if you want to.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.280]   I strongly believe that.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.200]   I think there's probably an 80% chance
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.760]   that everybody can get laid off if they want to.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.640]   Whether they can get that amazing severance
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.880]   or all that other stuff, that's a different matter,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.640]   and that takes much more negotiating and skill.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.480]   - Let me ask you a question,
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.200]   interrupt you to ask the question.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.120]   Do you believe that you can get laid off if you want to?
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.360]   Do you believe you can get laid off honorably
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.200]   if you want to?
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.280]   For example, I'm not willing to pursue the strategy
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.840]   like slacking off.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.800]   That goes against my moral code,
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.200]   and I'm not willing to do that.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.480]   Do you believe that you can get laid off honorably
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.880]   if you want to, or only if you're willing to engage
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.400]   in some of those other tactics and techniques?
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.680]   - Oh yeah, I mean, if you talk about honorably,
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.780]   it's talking about having a conversation,
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.120]   being proactive and talking about
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.560]   why you want to get laid off.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.120]   And if you want to do it, quote, less honorably,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.360]   then you can do what many, many, many, many
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.200]   employees do, and that is not put their full effort
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.240]   into their job while they're there.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.680]   I mean, it's so funny.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.260]   I actually crave, I don't crave,
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.840]   but I like the Monday to Friday time period,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   because that's when the traffic
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.920]   on the financial samurai is the most.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.080]   And why is that?
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.040]   Because everybody's slacking off at work.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.200]   On Saturday and Sunday, the traffic dips by 20 to 30%,
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.600]   because people are enjoying their lives.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.840]   So I think the use of the word honors is a little tricky,
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.440]   because at the end of the day, the employer pays you
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.760]   because you provide more value
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.240]   than your salary and benefits.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.240]   - But the reason I say honorably is,
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.620]   for example, if you're being paid on,
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.740]   every job would be different,
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.280]   but if you're being paid on time,
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.700]   which most of the highest earning professions
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.840]   are not being paid on time,
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.000]   but if you're being paid on time,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.640]   if you steal time from your employer,
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.200]   you're stealing time.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.700]   And so you can't, I don't see that as being honorable
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.840]   to go in where I'm being paid for an hourly wage
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.780]   and now I'm gonna take and start stealing time
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.560]   from my employer by slacking off so that they'll fire me.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.960]   That's different than many other circumstances,
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.520]   but I don't think it's wrong to use the word honorable.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.200]   Theft is theft, whether you're stealing time
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.660]   from your employer or stealing a stapler
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.800]   from the conference room.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.440]   If you're being paid for your time,
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.400]   you need to be producing and working
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.800]   to the best of your capability during that time.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.560]   - I think it's a gray area,
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.940]   'cause anybody who's worked has seen people not get in
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.040]   at 7 a.m. and work nonstop and take a 30 minute break.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.100]   So yeah, it's a gray area.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.620]   That's my opinion.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.500]   You can do it honorably if you want.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.820]   You can do it less honorably,
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.020]   but I strongly believe,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.860]   unlike trying to become a managing director
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.160]   or a vice president of the department or whatever,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.300]   it's much easier to get laid off than to ascend.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:50.300]   But the big irony is that there's so many,
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.960]   that's just not an irony.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.000]   It's really logical,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   but there's so many books and articles
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.200]   and stuff on how to make money,
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.520]   how to get paid, and how to promote it.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.640]   I really don't see anything on how to get laid off.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.960]   But the irony, I think, is that if you get laid off
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.720]   and engineer your severance, a severance package,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.880]   a negotiated severance package,
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.060]   you could actually get paid way more
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.920]   than someone who just stayed there.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.240]   And not only that,
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.840]   one of the things I talk about in my book
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.540]   is how you could actually double dip.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.560]   So most of the time,
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.520]   let's say you get laid off on June 1st,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.440]   and because you have to get paid your Warnack pay,
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.200]   let's say it's two months in California,
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.400]   you'll get salaried for June and July.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.040]   And let's say you get your severance too,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.720]   let's say it's half your salary
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.880]   and your salary is 100,000, so it's another 50,000.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.360]   So you get two months of pay
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.240]   plus your $50,000 severance.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.720]   But meanwhile, you don't even have to go to work.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.840]   They don't want you to go to work.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.200]   Actually, part of the deal is you don't come to work
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.300]   unless they agree to it.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.720]   So from June to July, and actually six more months,
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.040]   'cause your severance is equal to six months of your pay,
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.440]   you can either do nothing,
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.800]   go travel, start a business, do whatever,
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.600]   or you can actually find another job
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.320]   and earn double the money,
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.720]   which is something quite interesting
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.680]   that several of my clients have done.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.520]   - Indeed.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.280]   You were answering a two-part question.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.120]   One was feasibility and the second was timing
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.120]   when I interrupted you.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.120]   What are your thoughts with regard
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.840]   to the amount of time necessary to engineer a layoff?
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.560]   - I think the minimal amount of time is probably one month.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.600]   And a probably sweet spot is three to six months.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.040]   So during this time period,
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.080]   you need to be aware of your company's stance
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.400]   on hiring and laying people off
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.240]   and the whole business cycle.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.160]   And during this time period, you need to actively
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:46.040]   be building the strongest relationships you can
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:51.440]   with your hiring manager and the HR department
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.340]   if there is one close by who's in your office.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.600]   So basically, I would say a sweet spot
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.960]   is probably three to six months.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.480]   I started thinking about it about a year
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.760]   before I got laid off,
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.320]   and I really started thinking about it
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.280]   about three to four months after bonuses were paid.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.760]   And I was thinking to myself,
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.120]   this is maybe not worth it anymore.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.520]   - One of the areas that I pay attention to
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.360]   and I think is helpful is if you can get the business cycle
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.320]   to work in your favor.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.160]   And here we're talking about facing difficult times,
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.440]   so that's probably gonna lead to layoffs.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.920]   That would be easier to get laid off
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.480]   when the company is doing layoffs
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.920]   than if the company is growing and hiring all over the place.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   And as we record this here in August of 2016,
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.680]   I think that very possibly over the next upcoming years,
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.760]   we'll be facing a downturn and who knows,
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.920]   could be a significant downturn in the business cycle.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.560]   Now that's purely my opinion and guess,
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.980]   take it for what it is.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.120]   But in that context, I would expect to see
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.440]   a significant number of jobs lost.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.760]   I would expect to see significant numbers of layoffs
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.640]   as you go into recession, that's generally the trend.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.600]   And depending on how long or deep the recession indicates,
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.880]   how long or deep the cuts are.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.800]   And I think that recessions can be opportunities.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.820]   They can be challenges, but they can also be opportunities
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.560]   where if you're looking for a good time to take a sabbatical
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.320]   and take time off and if you've got money
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.660]   and you don't need the income,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.880]   then perhaps taking that time off during a recession
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.680]   is a really good way to do it.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.940]   And so I'd love for my listeners to be thinking about that
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.060]   because some of them have been wanting
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.820]   to do certain activities,
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:36.760]   want to take a couple of years and travel the world
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.080]   or to start a new business or start a hobby
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.200]   or spend time with aging parents, things like that.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.300]   So pretend for a moment that my guesses were accurate
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.620]   and I had listeners who were thinking,
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.620]   in the coming years, it'd be nice to get laid off
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.620]   in the next recession so that I can attend
[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.180]   to these other areas.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.940]   Give my listeners some practical steps,
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.920]   a checklist of sorts of some of the things
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.100]   that they can be doing proactively now
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.580]   so that they're first on the chopping block
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.460]   to get laid off with maximum benefit
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:09.640]   in coming changes in the business cycle, please.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.480]   - Sure.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.700]   I guess step one is to calculate your net worth
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.300]   and calculate your cash flow
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.740]   and calculate how much you have in the bank
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.660]   in terms of living expenses.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.140]   That's obvious.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.720]   The more you have, the better it is.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.040]   Step two, I think you should probably reach out
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.860]   to people who have been laid off,
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.460]   take them out for coffee or lunch
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:38.460]   and ask them in a, I guess, casual way,
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.820]   how has it been like since you were laid off
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.300]   and what type of benefits you got?
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.820]   You need to understand what you're playing for.
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.380]   The way I found out was actually having
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.980]   a really good conversation with my HR manager
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.940]   who basically explained to me what the benefits were
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:59.720]   and what I could expect going forward.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.840]   So once you know what you're playing for,
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.880]   then you can make even better calculations
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.380]   about your financial future.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:12.080]   The other step is to really develop strong relationships
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.980]   with your immediate manager.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:19.700]   Bite your tongue, see how you can help out more,
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.980]   just be a good team player.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.900]   People like to help people who they like.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:27.780]   It's very simple.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.100]   And again, I talk about in my book
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.500]   how it's really a relationship business.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.620]   The more you can get to know someone,
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.300]   the better and easier it is to tell someone
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.140]   your true thoughts and feelings and have them be accepted
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.180]   and have that someone understand and empathize
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.140]   and work towards helping you.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.720]   Because again, nobody wants to have an employee
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.500]   who doesn't wanna be there.
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.060]   And if you can help that person you're developing
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.940]   a good relationship with who has the power,
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.560]   make an easier decision come layoff time,
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.660]   then you're actually helping him or her as well as yourself.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:11.280]   And also, it depends on what you wanna do,
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.480]   whether you wanna travel, start a business,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.780]   take time off, or find another job.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:20.000]   You should be thinking, you should be having a test run
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.780]   on what it is you wanna do.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.000]   So if you wanna travel or if you wanna relocate
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.980]   and live in Mexico, maybe the next vacation
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.760]   should be in Mexico for one week
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.800]   where you absolutely pretend you don't have a job
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.240]   and you're living in Mexico in some apartment you rent
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.960]   in obviously not the Four Seasons or whatever.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.080]   If you wanna start a business, throw up a website.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.320]   Test out some ideas.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.920]   Ask friends what they think.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.800]   And ask strangers what they think even more
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.640]   because they'll probably be a little bit more honest.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.480]   In my case, Financial Samurai was a labor of love
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.420]   where I was trying to make sense of the chaos
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.120]   during the financial crisis.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.240]   And I just wrote because it was my personal journal.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.320]   I didn't really have a business plan.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.920]   I just wrote, wrote, wrote, wrote,
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.000]   and tried to build a community.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.040]   And then I realized, oh, you could actually make some money
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.880]   if you actually focus on the financial aspect
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.600]   of running a online media company.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.800]   But I had been testing for two and a half years
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.440]   before I actually pulled the trigger
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.940]   and negotiated my severance.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.920]   So I think those are the things that you need to think about.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.760]   Always think about the scenarios.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.380]   What if it happens?
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:28.220]   What would you do if it happens?
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.320]   But before that happens, I read so many stories
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.480]   about people, I quit my job and I'm gonna be an entrepreneur.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:37.800]   But they've only been testing for like one month.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.500]   And a lot of times people just end up going back to work.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.880]   And I give them credit and I give them full props
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.240]   for having the confidence to just leave
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.360]   without a financial runway, without extensive testing
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.080]   and extensive trial period.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.760]   But I don't think that's the wise,
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.080]   fiscal way to go about things.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.680]   People should really, really ask as many people as possible
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.080]   who've done it so they don't regret saying,
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.840]   I wish I knew then what I know now.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.680]   - Yeah, no question.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.280]   I've been laid off twice in my life.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.520]   The first time I'd worked at the job for about a week.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.200]   And then after a week, we quickly realized
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.360]   that the job I thought I was hired to do
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.960]   and the job that I was actually doing were very different.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.200]   And it was a kind of a mutual parting of ways
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.520]   where we realized we had accomplished a poor negotiation
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.600]   and it was not working out.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.040]   But the second job was I had been there
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:37.000]   for a couple of years and I was laid off out of the blue.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.880]   It was a total surprise to me.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:42.080]   And it wasn't due to non-performance.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.680]   My evidence of that was that I had received
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:48.040]   glowing reviews from my superiors
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.440]   and my, what do they call it, the corporate world,
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.000]   360 reviews and things like that.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.440]   And I had just received an 8% pay raise
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.840]   some few months earlier.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.720]   And so I knew it wasn't for cause
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.920]   of my own personal performance.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.440]   It was a company reorganization.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:07.440]   And they decided to eliminate the middle tier of my job.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.780]   The analyst position that I was in
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.820]   was being eliminated in favor of more entry level people
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:14.340]   and more senior people.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.360]   Because the job description in and of itself
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.200]   wasn't working out.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.120]   And so me and all of my coworkers at the middle level
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.960]   were laid off.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.360]   But it was a total surprise to me.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.960]   And I was not aware.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.040]   And it took me a while to figure out
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.400]   what was even happening in the meeting
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.720]   where I'm sitting there in the layoff meeting
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.560]   and I didn't know what was--
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.400]   - The folks were dancing around
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.240]   'cause it's tough to tell you.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.200]   - Yeah, and they're like,
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.460]   and it's that exact thing where they're trying to say it,
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.900]   but they're trying to use euphemisms and be polite,
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.740]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.340]   And all of a sudden it dawns on you,
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:48.540]   wait a second, I'm being laid off right now.
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.500]   (laughing)
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.860]   But I was caught in that circumstance really flat footed.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.340]   And thankfully, and they gave me
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.020]   a couple months of severance and it was nice.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.060]   Everything worked out fine.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.500]   And that was my first time being laid off
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.540]   from a corporate job where I got those benefits.
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.820]   And they treated me fairly.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.660]   I have no complaints.
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.600]   But I was caught flat footed.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:10.420]   And I didn't know what to negotiate.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.580]   I didn't know how to negotiate.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.980]   I didn't know what my rights were.
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.020]   I didn't know what any of those things.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.240]   I was just completely unprepared.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.820]   If you were seeking to prepare some of my listeners
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.140]   who could be in that situation
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.700]   and try to equip them with some knowledge
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.980]   of what their rights are,
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.940]   you talk about these things as being negotiable.
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:31.300]   If one of my listeners tomorrow goes into their office
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.940]   and has a circumstance like mine where they realize,
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.080]   wait a second, I'm being laid off right now.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.320]   What can they do to come out better
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.000]   on the other side of that meeting
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.120]   than they would otherwise?
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.620]   - Right, so one is to prepare
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.240]   by knowing what you're playing for.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.080]   And to know what you're playing for,
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.400]   there's precedence, right?
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.360]   In the law, in law of the land,
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.800]   you look at previous cases to set precedence
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.640]   for what you wanna argue.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.680]   So to set precedence is to simply ask people
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.460]   who've been laid off before.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.040]   To set precedence is to ask
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.200]   if you have a good relationship,
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.600]   which is what I want people
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.520]   to build better relationships internally.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.980]   To talk to HR, maybe, but be aware
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.460]   that if you talk to HR,
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.080]   HR has a high likelihood of telling their manager
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.720]   because HR is actually there
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.880]   to protect the corporation first
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.320]   and then its employees.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   So remember that.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.640]   HR is there to protect liability risks for the corporation
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.280]   and then to solve conflict internally.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.500]   I recommend everybody read their employee handbook.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.400]   I think the majority of people do not do that.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.960]   Man, when I got my employee handbook,
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.400]   it was thick.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.920]   And through that employee handbook,
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.320]   I realized, hey, I didn't realize this,
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:42.920]   but the company pays for my MBA if I get in.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.440]   And if I get a B or above,
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.960]   they'll pay 100% of it.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.480]   And so guess what?
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   That's exactly what I did.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.180]   I went to get my MBA at Berkeley and they paid for it.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.940]   And nobody else knew that.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.040]   They're like, what?
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.100]   They pay $28,000 a year to get your MBA?
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:58.940]   I can't believe it.
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.360]   I'm gonna do the same thing too.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.400]   I told everybody to read the handbook
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.960]   and they said, well, gosh, be darned.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.800]   And several other people got their MBA as well.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.440]   So read your employee handbook.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.000]   It is by law that you as an employee
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.360]   need to have all your rights laid out for you.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.300]   Whether you read them or not is a different matter,
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:20.400]   but you will find everything from 401k contribution matching
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.920]   to continuing education to COBRA,
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:27.060]   to short-term disability to long-term disability,
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.360]   and all that good stuff.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.860]   These are the things you will understand
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.840]   what you're playing for.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.440]   And then finally, one thing I wanna let you know,
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.120]   and I want readers to realize,
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.560]   is that there's a very big difference
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.400]   between Warren Act pay and severance.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.880]   A lot of people who actually are in your situation,
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.620]   like two years, one to, let's say one to three year,
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:50.640]   they get laid off and they say they got a severance
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.760]   of two months of pay.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.040]   The reality is, is that wasn't a severance.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.520]   That was mandatory by law, Warren Act pay.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.800]   The severance is on top of that Warren Act pay.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:05.160]   So please be aware of that.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.460]   - Interesting, that's a good point.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:09.560]   I have no idea if I received Warren Act pay
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.460]   or severance pay, I have no idea.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:13.240]   - Well, what did you, are you free to say
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.180]   what you got, like in terms of--
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.460]   - Yeah, just two months, I just got two months salary.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.980]   They continued to pay my salary.
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.300]   They didn't pay it out in a lump sum,
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.620]   they just continued to pay my salary
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:23.380]   on the standard schedule for the two months
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.080]   following my last day of work.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.660]   - And following your last day, right?
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:27.500]   So you didn't go in
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.740]   while you were getting paid the two months.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.340]   - No, I walked out, after that meeting,
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.980]   I went back to my desk and took my things out to the car
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.620]   and that was it.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.540]   - Right, so that is Warren Act pay.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:37.460]   - Interesting.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.580]   - Yeah, that's not a severance, that's Warren Act pay,
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.460]   which is fine, at least you got two months, right?
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:42.300]   - Sure, sure.
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.120]   - That's a good running away.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.060]   - Yeah, I got on an airplane and went to Columbia.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:45.900]   - There you go.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.960]   So I think that's the power of my book,
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:53.580]   is actually educating people on what they're fighting for
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:58.040]   and to not really be confused with all these words
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.860]   and these rules and all that.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.140]   The Warren Act pay is different from severance pay
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.820]   and let me tell you an example.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:08.620]   I tried really hard with one client to get a severance,
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.980]   but she couldn't get a severance,
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:12.060]   but she was miserable at her job,
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.000]   she was there for 10 years.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.680]   So what we did was, we had a really,
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.780]   she had a come to Jesus moment,
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.340]   I said, "Hey, look, are you serious
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.340]   "about wanting to move on?"
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.900]   She said, "Yes, I am.
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.760]   "I cry every week at my job, I hate it,
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.220]   "this is pathetic."
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:31.020]   And I gave her the confidence to have that discussion
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:35.540]   with her manager and this was in August.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:39.260]   And the manager was surprised, generally they are surprised,
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.740]   but empathetic 'cause they had a good relationship
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:43.780]   and he said, "How about this?
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:48.900]   "Can you come on board, can you work until January?"
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:49.900]   So this is August, right?
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.380]   So August, September, October, November,
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:55.220]   so it was four or five months, right?
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:58.980]   And look, we'll still pay you 100% of your salary,
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:03.380]   but how about just come in three days a week?
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:06.280]   So really, that's kind of, if you do the math,
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.620]   three days, but you're getting paid for five days,
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:10.780]   you just got a huge raise.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.740]   And then she said, "You know what?
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:13.780]   "It's not gonna really fly,
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:17.520]   "I'd rather just have my severance
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.680]   "just like the people who got laid off
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:22.460]   "due to a reorg a year ago did."
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.340]   And I think they got like one or two weeks per year work.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.980]   And so they had talks with the bigger boss
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.800]   and they're like, "No, no, no, no, no, we can't do this
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.420]   "'cause you're a good employee."
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.520]   And then she said, "How about this?
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.660]   "How about this?
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.000]   "Instead of three days a week,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.320]   "I'll come in for the next five months,
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.780]   "I'll come in two days a week."
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.460]   (laughing)
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.480]   So they said, "Okay, two days a week,
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.320]   "that's better than nothing.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:47.060]   "You're a valued employee, we love you, you're a manager."
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.620]   So she came in two days a week.
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.500]   She decided Monday to Wednesday,
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.380]   and sometimes she decided Monday to Tuesday
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:56.020]   so she can have a long weekend to do whatever.
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:57.220]   And they paid her full benefits.
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:58.900]   So if you're working two days a week,
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:00.960]   but you get paid five days,
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.180]   so you're kind of like getting 150% raise.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.660]   And then still she was so happy
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.340]   'cause she felt like she was winning
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.100]   'cause she was proactive.
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.220]   And she didn't get that severance that she wanted,
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.100]   which was like 20 to 30 weeks.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.260]   But for five months, she was able to have
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.660]   this carefree lifestyle where she made max money.
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:22.540]   And then they gave her the two months of Warn Act pay.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.640]   And here's the kicker.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.340]   She did so good in the transition
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:32.580]   that they hired her back as a consultant 10 months later.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.420]   (laughing)
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.880]   For 35% more.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.880]   - Do you remember what her salary was,
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.620]   or ballpark what her salary was
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.620]   when she was working there as an employee?
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.140]   - Yeah, so she was making like 125 base,
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.940]   and then she had like maybe $15,000 a year in bonus.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.780]   - Okay.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.580]   - So now her run rate is like 170,000.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.020]   - Okay, so I wanna put some numbers
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.180]   to what you just said and point out
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.820]   for my audience to learn the lesson
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.340]   that in negotiations, when you have a negotiation like that,
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.000]   you have a much bigger opportunity
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.260]   to make a huge financial impact
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.880]   than you do at many other times,
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.340]   which is why you gotta take negotiations seriously,
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.820]   whether they're hiring negotiations
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.140]   or firing negotiations.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.220]   - Or buying a house.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.060]   - Right.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.820]   - Or buying a car, anything, negotiation is key.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.580]   - Anything, so let's put some numbers to it.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.860]   So just focusing on that 20% difference,
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.080]   'cause they offered her three days a week
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.340]   versus two days a week.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:29.680]   If she was making $140,000 a year
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.680]   with 125 plus 15 of bonus,
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.900]   that comes out to $11,666 a month.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.900]   And then if we were gonna calculate five months of that,
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.780]   that comes out to $58,333 total.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.260]   And her difference between two days a week
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:49.500]   and three days a week is a 20% difference
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.180]   of total work days,
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.160]   meaning between two days a week and three days a week
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.120]   versus five days a week.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.980]   So let's just take 20% of that $58,000 number.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:02.980]   That's an $11,666 basically free money
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.060]   just by pushing back and saying,
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.500]   well, I'm not so sure.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.700]   That's an extra $11,600 in her pocket
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.740]   by just pushing back and getting it down to two days
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.100]   instead of three days.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.940]   - Yeah, and I mean, if you wanna say
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.580]   she's getting paid five days for only working two days,
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.940]   I mean, the math is even more.
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.540]   It's like she's getting more and more and more,
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.380]   and then she got the two months of salary,
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.060]   which is another 20-something thousand,
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.260]   and then she got all her vacation days paid,
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.320]   which was like a month's worth.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.100]   Oh, one tip I need readers to realize,
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.580]   and this was a mistake I made,
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.460]   was that I took a five-day Hawaiian vacation
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.520]   during my sevens negotiation period,
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.180]   and I made a mistake.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.100]   I shouldn't have done that.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:49.340]   Instead, I should have just taken sick days.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:55.100]   I think we have something like seven to nine sick days
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.620]   a year, and I never took them.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.460]   Well, no, no, sorry.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.340]   I took one or two days a year maybe on average
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.620]   for my 11 years at that place.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:05.340]   Because I didn't take my sick days,
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.580]   I didn't get five days worth of vacation pay,
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.580]   and each day of vacation pay is equal
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:11.880]   to one day of your salary,
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.340]   something to be aware of.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.020]   But that might cross the gray area,
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.380]   'cause you're not sick if you're in Hawaii.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.220]   - Right, right.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.500]   One more question on this layoff,
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.740]   and then I wanna come back to your financial
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.580]   independence story, and we'll be done.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:30.100]   In the corporate environment,
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.300]   these things are more standardized.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.140]   You have a handbook that's gonna lay these things out,
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:41.140]   and the farther you go up the chain,
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:46.260]   in terms of if you're the CEO of a large Fortune 500 company
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.780]   and they're trying to fire you,
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.700]   your lawyers and their lawyers are gonna be negotiating
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.340]   over your severance package for a long time,
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.500]   'cause it's all pre-negotiated,
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.580]   and we're talking millions of dollars
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.340]   of severance package for them to get you out of there.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.020]   - It's disgusting and crazy.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:57.860]   - It's amazing.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.700]   And so in the corporate environment,
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:01.840]   things are very, very structured,
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.820]   and I think you have, my opinion,
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.500]   feel free to disagree in a moment,
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.100]   my opinion is you have a bit of an advantage there,
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.420]   because when the manager who cares about you,
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.980]   or the human resources representative who cares about you
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:15.100]   is negotiating with you, it's not their money,
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.900]   they're the steward of it, but it's not their money,
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.380]   so they're more likely to say,
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.700]   okay, I wanna help you out,
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.140]   we'll give you a little bit extra here,
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:23.980]   because it's the company's money.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:24.980]   - And they'll get an upgrade for someone
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.460]   who hopefully will wanna be there.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:27.540]   - Right, right.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.980]   Now, when you're in the small business scenario,
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:32.780]   and that's where the majority of Americans work,
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:34.980]   is with small businesses, where the business owner
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:37.780]   is involved in the day-to-day operations of the company,
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.220]   most likely, if you're getting laid off,
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.740]   you're gonna be being laid off by the business owner.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.240]   And is there a difference of negotiation here,
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.500]   of the strengths that you have,
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.860]   and the weaknesses that you have,
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.380]   and if so, or if not, but if so,
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.020]   how would you approach it differently
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.240]   if you're working in a small business
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.860]   with eight employees versus 800?
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:02.020]   - I would approach it quite similarly.
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.540]   Small business is much more intimate,
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:07.540]   and hopefully everybody has a better relationship
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:10.660]   with their managers and bosses and owners in that case.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:15.940]   So, probably what you have to play for will be less,
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.100]   and it's all relative to size of that small business
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.060]   versus a large corporation.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.060]   And small businesses aren't subject
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.300]   to the Warren Act mandatory pay,
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.900]   but they operate under similar guidelines.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.320]   It's important to recognize that, actually,
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.380]   a small business might care about its reputation
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.700]   relatively more than a big business,
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.420]   because a bad reputation, let's say a bad Yelp rating,
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.900]   or whatever, might really hurt that small business.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.940]   And so, what they want to do
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.880]   is treat you as a good employee
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.180]   if you treat them as good employers.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:54.200]   And they want you to move on in a happy manner.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.440]   Every single company is terrified of employee lawsuits,
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.100]   discrimination suits, whatever.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.740]   They have it all the time.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:05.340]   This costs legal fees, time, money, stress.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.980]   These are things that small businesses do not have time for
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.540]   and probably can't afford as much as a large corporation.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:16.280]   So, the way to approach a small business
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.140]   is to do the best you can
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.260]   and to have the most honest conversations you can
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.100]   about why you want to move on.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.940]   And so, the example I gave with my friend
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:29.760]   who negotiated two days of work a week for five months,
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.900]   and then the two months of Warnack,
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.260]   she didn't get a severance.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.620]   She worked at somewhat of a small business,
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.340]   it's a private business, but it's not that small,
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.820]   but it's small, blur, it's in those big corporations.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.420]   And they work something out like that,
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.860]   where, okay, transition period, we need someone,
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.020]   we need your help, we've got clients to deal with,
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.820]   we don't want to hurt the business,
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.940]   we'll still pay you this, but here, you can have less time.
[01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:54.340]   So, small businesses actually can provide you
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.580]   even more flexibility, right?
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:58.420]   So, it's all about time and money.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:02.120]   They might not be able to give you as much money,
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.280]   but they might be able to give you more time.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.720]   And I actually value time much more,
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.880]   much, much greater the older I get.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.840]   - Yeah, that's a fundamental basis of negotiation
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.560]   is you always want to negotiate separately
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.860]   different terms of the contract.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.080]   And what most beginning negotiators,
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.400]   one mistake they often make is by spending all the time
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.640]   focusing on money, but money and terms
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.880]   are two very different things.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.820]   And many times in various negotiations,
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:32.820]   if you can negotiate more favorable terms,
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.160]   that could be much more valuable to you than money,
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.520]   than the specific dollar figure.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.300]   And here, when you talk about time,
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.880]   we're just talking about an additional term
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.440]   of the agreement that's not just the dollar figure.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.120]   Go ahead.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.920]   - I was just saying, so, yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.180]   And the time that you negotiate or the terms,
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.600]   you need to know what's important to you.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.200]   And if you need time to go see the world, awesome.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.060]   If you need time to go find another job
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.920]   or spend time with your family, great.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.420]   Figure out what that term is most valuable to you.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:09.680]   I'm in the world where it's very trendy and popular
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.400]   to quit your job, start an online business,
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.040]   travel the world, all that stuff.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.980]   But what people don't read about and hear about
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.720]   are the people who do all that stuff on a whim
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.160]   and who come back and kind of regret
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.760]   their financial decisions and their spontaneity.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:31.120]   There's no articles really about that.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.520]   But I've seen that many, many times.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.440]   And hey, the good thing is that a lot of people
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.440]   kind of just end up landing back on their feet.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:44.600]   They might have a huge hole in their financial well-being
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.280]   because of their spontaneity.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.000]   But I really want people to think about
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.080]   never quitting, getting laid.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.760]   Never quitting, getting laid.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.760]   And getting to some agreeable terms
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.080]   that can be a positive for both sides.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.060]   - So that brings us as an ideal transition
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.040]   to the last thing I wanted just to mention
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:08.040]   to you quickly here, which is about your personal path.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.080]   You mentioned that since about 2012,
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.960]   you've considered yourself to be,
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.080]   excuse me, yeah, about 11 or 12,
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.680]   you considered yourself to be
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.280]   basically financially independent.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.140]   So that's going on five plus years now
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.000]   of financial independence and you've been
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.680]   building Financial Samurai and you've had
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:27.240]   various other consulting and employment opportunities.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:32.240]   I wanna ask you, many of my listeners are working towards
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.800]   a lifestyle like you've built and achieved.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.520]   What is the best thing that you are so grateful for
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.040]   about your current lifestyle?
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:48.000]   - The best thing, the freedom to choose.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.560]   The freedom to choose is all someone ever wants.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.640]   Whether it is to choose your own mistakes
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.960]   or to choose your own victories.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.960]   It is just unbelievable to be able to make choices
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.140]   based on your own core beliefs.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:12.280]   And it's also a thing where you don't have
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.020]   to hang out with people or do things
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.680]   because you're beholden to anybody because of money.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.840]   It actually feels terrible now that I look back upon it
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.240]   that you bite your tongue, don't speak up
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.840]   for things you believe in because you're afraid
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.740]   that if you piss off someone who decides
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:35.740]   your career, paycheck, livelihood, that they'll screw you.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:40.960]   So achieve financial independence first for yourself
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.520]   so you can have the freedom to choose.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.200]   And then once you have the freedom to choose
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.480]   and you have this money coming in
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.840]   that will help you live a more free life,
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.080]   then you can use that time and money to help other people.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.520]   Whether it's through writing a blog for free
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.960]   to just teach people concepts and pitfalls
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.560]   that you've gone through so they never ask
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.760]   if I knew then what I know now.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.640]   And I think about it from a family perspective.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.880]   If you're financially independent,
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.200]   you can spend so much time with your children,
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.600]   your spouse, things such as stress at home
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.300]   because one parent is always stressed at work
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.560]   in a way and one parent is staying home
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.100]   to take care of the kids.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.520]   That stuff kind of really dissipates
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.520]   when you have that financial freedom.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.480]   So one of the things I ask my readers is,
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.960]   is not wanting to be rich, is not wanting
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.740]   to be financially free greedy?
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:39.480]   And that's something that people have discussed
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.720]   where it's like hey, the sooner you get
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.000]   to financial independence, the sooner you can help
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.480]   other people and that's kind of the way
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.800]   that I've been thinking about things
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.400]   for the past four or five years.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   - It's funny you talk about freedom.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.640]   Every time I get a nasty review on my podcast,
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.800]   I just think to myself, I appreciate,
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.120]   I think to the reviewer, I appreciate the comments,
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.440]   usually 'cause I say all kinds of things
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.360]   that make people angry with me.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.160]   And I always think, okay, I appreciate the comment,
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.360]   but you have no idea what I gave up
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.360]   in order to achieve the independence
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.640]   to be able to speak my mind no matter what it is
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.080]   without worrying about somebody else's brand,
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.120]   without worrying about my job, et cetera.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.400]   If you think that I'm gonna go back
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.200]   to having to think about, well, how is this
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.480]   gonna position my firm, blah, blah, blah,
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.360]   and do I need to protect this person's reputation, et cetera,
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.720]   if you think I'm gonna go back to that
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.080]   just to meet your idea of what I should or shouldn't say,
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.480]   no chance.
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.360]   The freedom to live the way that you want to live
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.600]   is incredibly, incredibly valuable.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.160]   - Sam, what is the thing that when you were working,
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.360]   hustling 12-hour days, saving like crazy,
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.400]   that you just thought, man, if someday,
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.040]   if someday I can quit, it's gonna be just so awesome
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.840]   because I can do X.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.760]   And then you achieved it after a while
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.200]   and you thought, you know, I was really excited about this,
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.880]   but frankly, it's not quite as good as I thought.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.960]   What were the things that you thought were gonna be great
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.600]   that in hindsight now haven't turned out
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.400]   to be quite so great as you thought?
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:24.320]   - I think the biggest downside to early retirement,
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.720]   financial independence, whatever, is boredom.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.120]   Because especially the younger you are,
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.240]   I would always kind of wake up by 6 a.m. every morning
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.680]   because the markets open at 6.30 a.m.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.400]   And I was trained to do that biologically
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.920]   for the past 11 years.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:45.720]   So I'd wake up at 6 a.m., brush my teeth, drink some water,
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.280]   and then maybe do some writing and work,
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.280]   and I'd be done by like 9 a.m. almost always, maybe 10 a.m.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.400]   And then I'd wanna like go out and play.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.600]   So I would call my friends, and there were no friends
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.000]   who could go out and play at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m.,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.240]   so I had to figure out new people to hang out with.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.000]   I was like a tennis bum in the park
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.880]   where I would just hang out with people
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.680]   who were traditionally retired
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.120]   or outside my demographic or whatever.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.280]   So it can get lonely.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.840]   It can get boring when you have all this free time.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:25.840]   So that is something that I was surprised about
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.480]   because I'm kind of masochistic in the way I think.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:36.360]   Like I believe work makes vacations a little bit better.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.020]   And after one and a half years of just doing my own thing,
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:46.800]   I decided to consult for one of these FinTech startups
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.180]   here in San Francisco, there are many,
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.940]   and to work just 20 to 25 hours a week.
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:54.960]   And I found a lot of great things going on.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.240]   You know, I was back in the environment.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.440]   I shot the shit with people.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.800]   You know, I was getting paid.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.000]   I was learning new things.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.420]   It was really, really fun.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:07.500]   So I think a lot of people have to guard against,
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.720]   I guess, boredom, but I think everything
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.080]   is pretty rational and logical.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.260]   If you're bored, you're gonna find something to do.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.160]   And if you're unhappy with work,
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.080]   you're gonna find some way to get out.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.520]   So that was the biggest surprise.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.680]   But the upsides are way better, way, way, way, way better.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.440]   I mean, I'm sitting here in Lake Tahoe right now
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.280]   talking to you and I'm gonna go jump in the pool
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.800]   and go in the hot tub.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.340]   I love that, I mean, that's awesome.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.720]   And I never take that for granted.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.440]   So it's worth it.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.640]   It's worth the struggle.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.960]   It's worth the sacrifice.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.360]   It's worth not buying a stupid car.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.040]   It's worth not living in a fancy house
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:46.960]   so that you have, you know, sacrifice a little bit
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.440]   and live like a king or queen forever.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.280]   Why not?
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.240]   - Sam, thanks for coming on.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.960]   Tell us about your website where listeners can buy the book
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.640]   that we've been discussing, How to Engineer a Layoff,
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.280]   and any follow-up calls to action
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.080]   that you'd like to make for my audience.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.360]   - So I write at financialsamurai.com.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.720]   And if you wanna buy the book,
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.560]   it's in my menu bar at the top right.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.400]   It's called Freedom Book.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.860]   And you can read about it.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.400]   And my site is really about
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.360]   achieving financial independence sooner rather than later.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.040]   You can see a lot of the top posts
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.880]   on the right-hand side column if you scroll down.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.880]   And it really talks about everything from your career
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.080]   to real estate investing, to stock market investing,
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:37.520]   to asset allocation, to economic terms,
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.080]   to early retirement.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.320]   And it also tries to motivate and challenge you
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.060]   to get better financially so that ultimately
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.380]   you have the money to be free and also to be happy.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.860]   It's just about happiness at the end of the day.
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:54.340]   And so if you wanna be happy
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.320]   and if you wanna achieve financial freedom sooner,
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.720]   then check out financialsamurai.com.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.560]   - And I'll finish just with another endorsement of it
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.280]   that I've probably been reading your site.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.120]   I don't read every day,
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.900]   but I've read your site off and on
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.120]   since a year or two after you started probably.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.240]   And I've always appreciated
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.880]   the experience that you bring to it.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.400]   So many of my listeners appreciate
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.160]   Radical Personal Finance because of my experience
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.840]   in formal financial planning.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.680]   It brings a different tone and flavor to the content
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.840]   than a podcast host who doesn't have background
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.160]   in formal planning.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.880]   And I'll say the same thing for you
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   is that your experience in financial planning
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.040]   and investment management, excuse me,
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.840]   brings a different level of analysis
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.560]   and different level of analysis and content
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.280]   to your writing than many other financial blogs.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.040]   And so if my listeners appreciate the ideas
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.720]   that I bring from financial planning,
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.320]   you'll appreciate the ideas that Sam brings
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.360]   to his writing from financial services.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.560]   So Sam, thanks so much for coming on.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.760]   I really appreciate it.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:54.640]   - All right, thanks Josh.
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.480]   And thanks guys.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.440]   I'll see you guys on Financial Samurai.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.220]   - Hey Radicals, it's me again.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.420]   Just real quick, after the interview with Sam
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:04.080]   because his book is an e-book,
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.660]   I went and asked him if he offered
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.120]   an affiliate program for his book.
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.880]   An affiliate program is where you sign up
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.640]   through some kind of system and you become an affiliate
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.580]   where you get to earn a commission
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.120]   when you promote other people's products.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.320]   And he does have that program.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.740]   So I went ahead and signed up for it.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:20.960]   If you're interested in purchasing Sam's book,
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.200]   How to Engineer Your Layoff, Negotiate a Severance
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.440]   and Be Free, I would appreciate it
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.760]   if you consider using the affiliate link
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.720]   that I've established.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.360]   The link that I'll put in the show notes for today's show,
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.400]   which pull up on your phone or on the website
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.960]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.400]   That link will take you through my affiliate link.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.200]   And if you buy the book through that link,
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.960]   then I'll receive a commission for that.
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.000]   Thank you very much.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.200]   If you're just thinking of this later,
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.600]   just remember and use the link
