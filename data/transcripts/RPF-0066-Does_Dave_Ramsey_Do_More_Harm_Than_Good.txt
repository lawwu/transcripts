[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.560]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.800]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.800]   I'm your host.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.880]   Today's show, a little bit different, just a quick intro here.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.440]   I am at FinCon 2014, actually podcasting or actually releasing this introduction right
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.160]   from the hallway, right between sessions.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.360]   And I've just recorded this show that you will hear in just a moment, which is an interview
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   with Steve Stewart.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.160]   And for a long time people have been asking me, I've made various comments about Dave
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.200]   Ramsey and I'm a fan of his, but I'm also not.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000]   And Steve and I decided to go ahead and sit down and do a show together.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.320]   And Steve is a really a great guy.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.360]   He runs a show called Money Plan SOS.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.760]   And he's a big fan of Dave Ramsey.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.360]   He's a Dave Ramsey coach and big fan.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.080]   Dave has had a great impact in his life.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.520]   I've been a little bit fearful to do this content just because I want to be very careful.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.880]   I'm a big Dave fan, but I also want to have some things I would like to see done differently,
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.560]   which is why I'm doing my show in the first place.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.880]   So I told Steve, I said, "Thankfully, since you're a big fan, maybe you can help me keep
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.260]   from destroying myself in the conversation."
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.720]   So you're about to hear a recorded conversation between Steve and myself.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.200]   I hope you enjoy it and I hope you find it thought provoking.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.400]   I am probably more than any other show I've released.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.640]   I'm nervous about releasing this one, but I feel like I've got to.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.680]   So I hope you enjoy it and I would love your feedback.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680]   Here's the interview.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.320]   I'm sitting here with Joshua Sheets from Radical Personal Finance, one of my favorite new finance
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.320]   podcasts.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.960]   Joshua Sheets, tell us a little bit about your podcast and what you're doing over there.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.720]   I am trying to provide an alternative for existing financial broadcast radio.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.560]   So when people are tired of the current options, then they have an option for maybe a slightly
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.400]   more in-depth level of financial radio.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.460]   That's basically my vision of what I'm looking to create.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.160]   My audience is traditionally people who are just trying to get out of debt and we don't
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.360]   get too deep into the personal finance topics, but you have a history and you've got a whole
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.640]   bunch of letters behind your name.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.020]   Tell us a little bit about what those are.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.080]   Not going into too much depth, but you've got a background.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   That's what I'm trying to get at.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.800]   All that stuff means is I'm good at taking tests.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   That's basically all it is.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.040]   But yes, I have been a professional financial advisor for the last six years.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.760]   And during that time, I've worked hard.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.120]   I have a bunch of financial planning designations.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.640]   Probably the, I think I counted the other day, I think it was seven at this point.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.720]   But again, all it means is just I'm good at taking tests, but a CFP background.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.380]   And then I actually just finished a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.640]   So I do have some history in the technical side of financial planning, as well as a history
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.800]   of actually working with clients, which probably is the biggest difference between me and many
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.000]   other people is when you work with clients.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.640]   And I've worked with over a thousand people face to face over the last six years.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.080]   That makes a big difference in your perspective.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.680]   You know, listening to your podcast, I can tell that you've got the knowledge behind
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   it all.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.120]   And the approach that I like, I like the approach that you have in your show because it does
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.180]   come off.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.560]   You do give your opinion, but it is, it's not as if this is the way it works.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.860]   It is as if another option that will work for specific people.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.720]   So I appreciate that aspect.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.840]   Tell us a little bit why you do it that way.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.560]   I am a recovering dogmatic, which is actually kind of the primary thing I know what we were
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   going to talk about.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.080]   But I spent years as a personal finance junkie, and I always loved finance.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.320]   I always loved reading the books.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.080]   I love listening to the shows.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   I love listening to the radio.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.480]   But what you pick up, whether it's you listen to whether it's, you know, AM political talk
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.080]   or whether it's you watch kind of the way media works, you pick up this mode of thinking
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.680]   of right and wrong, this idea that there is right and then there is wrong.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.440]   And I'm not talking about morality at this moment.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.320]   That's a whole separate philosophical discussion.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.480]   But especially with regard to money, we get these certain ideas that this is right and
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.360]   this is wrong.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.080]   And I know that for me, that was a big thing because I fully adopted that approach and
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.560]   that idea that there are certain right ways to handle money or certain right financial
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.880]   decisions to make.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.260]   And then there are certain wrong ways to handle money and certain wrong financial decisions
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.640]   to make.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.800]   And what I learned with actually practice, practice in the professional sense, meaning
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.920]   actually working with clients, is that it's simply not true.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.280]   There are things that are technically correct, but many times a lot of it isn't subject to
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.900]   personal adaptation.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.240]   And that's the key point that is missing in financial talk radio.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.840]   That's the key point that's missing in most personal finance books.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.600]   And so that's what I determined to do is not to tell somebody what to think or what to
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.780]   do, but rather teach them everything I know and allow them to be adults.
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.480]   What happens is we pick this up somehow, this idea that we have to tell each other how to
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.440]   live and tell each other what to do.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.120]   And it's this very juvenile thing, I think, it's probably schooled into us where we're
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.000]   taught that there is right and there is wrong and there is a master at the front of the
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   class and we're the slaves who have to regurgitate to the master the right answer to get the
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.360]   appropriate reward and avoid the punishment and avoid the penalty.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.940]   So our society, speaking of the US American society, gets more and more in this direction
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.500]   where we get into the idea of this is right and wrong in areas where there's just simply
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   not right and wrong.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.700]   It's simply not.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.560]   And so it took years, literally I would say about three years of actually working as a
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.200]   financial advisor to where I finally discovered that I was an idiot and I'm taking this approach
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.920]   of telling clients this is what's right and finally I just learned to shut up and start
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.260]   listening.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.360]   And once I learned to shut up and start listening to people and then just simply started being
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.660]   more of a coach and teaching them the things that are technically accurate, it made a major
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.560]   difference in the results the clients achieved.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560]   Made a major difference.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.040]   And there's more to it but that's why in my show I refuse to say this is what you should
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040]   do with your life.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.760]   Rather I say you're an adult.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   Figure out what you want to do with your life.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.200]   And I can destroy most of the things that people take for granted.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   I can destroy most of the purple cows.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.560]   Maybe that's not the right word but there are certain things that people hold as the
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   holy grail.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.920]   This is the way that things should be done.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.440]   And I can destroy most of those and I've learned to do that over time.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.400]   And so now because all the things that I used to think were right to do or not right to
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.840]   do, again I've learned that everything is not black and white.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.680]   And so that heavily influences my show.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.640]   >> See I think for my show I do a lot of this is the way it works stuff but hopefully I
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.920]   educate my audience as well.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.800]   Do you think that we as a culture think that maybe the answers are in a book and it really
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.960]   is a misconception?
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.760]   There's really no way to learn everything in one book.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   Do you believe that?
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.600]   >> It's not so much about the book.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.520]   All you get when you're reading a book is you're getting an author's perspective and
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.600]   you're getting a philosophy.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.320]   And so I don't mind, for example, I don't mind having a book where someone is presenting
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   a strong opinion.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.240]   But what happens is that there's almost many, especially in the financial world, there are
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.160]   certain things that go to another level and then we adapt this idea of this is right and
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   this is wrong.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   I'll give you an example.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   Maybe this will help to clarify.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.920]   Would you generally counsel people that it's a good idea to save money?
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   >> Yes.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   >> Okay.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   I would too.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   Okay.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.520]   But can you also then concurrent with that thought hold on your other thought and design
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.080]   ideas and situations in which saving money is not a good thing?
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.280]   And here let me flesh this out so you understand.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.820]   So there is only one reason in the world to save money because you value what that future
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.400]   savings means to you for your goals more than you value the consumption that you can have
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   today.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.080]   So if I have $100 and I have a choice between spending the $100 and consuming it today versus
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.320]   saving the $100, the only rational reason for me to save the money is because I value
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.840]   what the future higher dollars would mean to me more than I value the consumption for
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.180]   $100 today.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.520]   So what happens in personal finance is that it's easy for us who are involved and really
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.280]   engaged in this to look down on people who are spending all their money.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.360]   And I've learned not to do that.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.760]   I just simply view it as they're being rational.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.800]   They're expending their money and enjoying the consumption that they can get with this.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.920]   So we develop this culture of being critical of people who buy new cars or people who spend
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.220]   money on things that we perceive to be frivolous.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.560]   And we look down on them because, well, that's not us.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.920]   But we don't recognize that that's just simply not us.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.320]   There's a personality difference.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.120]   I'm a huge, huge proponent of saving.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.640]   At this point in my life, I am very much saving money.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:07.720]   But beyond the amount of money that I, as my wealth and my financial base grows over
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.280]   time, as I accumulate capital, I'll have a decision.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.560]   Do I want to allocate that capital at my death to my kids or to a charity or something like
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.480]   that to build an estate?
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.240]   And I don't know what those decisions will be today.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.480]   But let's assume that I allocate a certain amount of money towards those things.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.000]   Then at that point in time, the rational thing for me to do is to spend the rest of my money
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.840]   on the things that are important to me throughout my lifetime.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.260]   So that's a little bit more nuanced view of the saving versus spending.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.280]   And so what happens is I think a better way to approach it, instead of looking down on
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.040]   people because they're not saving money and somehow viewing it as a moral shortcoming,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.760]   why don't we show people what they can achieve if they save money?
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.260]   So look in the personal finance community.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.800]   Look at the traction that occurs right now with the early retirement financial independence
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   movement.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.520]   There is a major, major push from many people pushing towards this idea of early retirement.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.960]   And you say, "We've got this retirement crisis in the country.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.720]   There's a retirement crisis in the country, but no one has any money saved for retirement."
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.800]   Well, that's true.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.600]   But the reason is, have you ever thought of the fact that most people just simply don't
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.080]   want to retire?
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.400]   They might not want to retire.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.600]   Now, I certainly don't think that everybody holds that opinion.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.380]   There are many things that can happen.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.520]   But look at the motivation that somebody can achieve when they're focusing on early retirement.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.880]   Because now they can see and they can connect this idea that, "I would like to be financially
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.620]   independent in 10 years."
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.460]   And there's this idea of freedom, and that's very motivating.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.120]   So now, instead of having to fight this stupid, "Oh, I have to budget $100 in this category
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.000]   and I have to feel deprived because I'd like to spend $150."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.040]   No, it's not about deprivation.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.720]   It's about seeing the vision of what I want and then following it.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.680]   So that would be just an example of one of those things that would be the fundamental
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.100]   of personal finance.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.100]   Saving money.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.120]   Saving money is not always the rational thing to do.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.920]   If I had a million dollars and I were diagnosed with terminal cancer, if I, assuming I had
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.440]   taken care of my medical costs, assuming I had taken care of my family that was depending
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.560]   on me, I would work as hard as I could to spend the million dollars before I died.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   I would.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.200]   And I think that's a rational approach.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.000]   Now that's very different than at this stage of my life, where I'm very focused on saving
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.200]   money because I value the future higher dollars and the freedom that money buys me for the
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   future.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   That's why I save money.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.800]   Does that help to understand what I say as far as dogma versus going a little deeper
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.640]   and teaching people how to think?
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.640]   That's what I mean.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   Yes, yes.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.560]   And I hope my listeners don't think that I'm looking down on them if they're not saving
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   money, but I do preach that they should save money because ... And maybe on my show I don't
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.520]   explain this enough, but if we don't save any money, then we are trading in those future
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.360]   dollars for stress when we don't have the money for a broken engine in the car or whatever
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.360]   like that.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.560]   All right.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.440]   The real reason why we're getting on this topic today is because ... And I remember
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.800]   it was way back in episode 25 or something of yours that you had mentioned that you wanted
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   to get into the discussion about Dave Ramsey's investing advice.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.320]   And now we need to lay the foundation here that Joshua Sheets is not a Dave Ramsey hater.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.040]   He actually went through the process of getting out of debt following Dave's principles.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   Is that correct?
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   You want to tell a little bit about that story?
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   I'll tell the story.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.080]   I know that I've been looking forward to this conversation, but I've also been very fearful
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:18.240]   of the conversation because it's easy to pick on those who are successful.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:24.400]   And it's very challenging to negotiate because I do not want to be negative towards any one
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.720]   person.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.360]   And so let me tell my Dave Ramsey story.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   What if I called in?
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   I think I did call in.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360]   I don't remember.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.440]   But let me tell ... I may have called in on this Friday show.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.840]   But I think it's important because I hear this consistently throughout even this conference
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   at FinCon.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.480]   I hear this all through the halls.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.000]   Everyone is talking about this type of thing.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.800]   And I think we've got to get the conversation out there because then we can grow together.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.040]   So I'm depending on you to help me not be a hater because I'm not a hater.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040]   I like Dave.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.120]   I would enjoy meeting him.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.200]   I don't see realistically, I don't think we'd ever be best buddies.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.920]   We don't really have a lot in common other than finance.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.000]   But I'm not an anti-Dave guy.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.120]   I first was exposed to Dave Ramsey when I was in college.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.200]   And my brother listened to his show and my brother gave me a copy of Total Money Makeover.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.240]   And at that point in time, I was a fairly arrogant, know-it-all business person.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.440]   I'm sure it's very surprising because I was a young male in college and we think we know
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.800]   it all.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.680]   And I was very much focused on real estate investment at that time as my path to wealth
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.160]   and other people's money and no money down and this was in the real estate heyday.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.120]   And I got sucked into that.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.280]   So my brother gave me a copy of Dave's book.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.280]   He had listened to the show.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   He'd bought the Total Money Makeover.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.640]   He gave a copy to me and said, "Here, read this book.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.840]   I think you'd enjoy it."
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.680]   Not any kind of manipulative, "You've got to do this.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   I like this book.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   I think you'd enjoy it."
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.280]   So I read the book once and I thought, "This guy's dumb.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.680]   He doesn't know what he's talking about."
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.640]   But there was something that kind of tickled me a little bit.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.080]   I read it again and then I read it again.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.520]   And then the third time through, just the statement that stood out to me is he made
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   a statement in the book.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:02.080]   He said, "If you had no payments, how much money would you have in your life?"
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.880]   And at that point in time, I was paying my way through school and what I would wind up
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.120]   doing is I was always just a little bit short and I worked my way through my freshman year,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   barely.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.840]   Then in my sophomore year, I decided I was working too hard, which was nonsense.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.080]   I was working, but I wasn't working too hard.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.400]   I actually had three jobs my first freshman year, but I still had plenty of time.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.640]   And then my sophomore year, so I started borrowing money on student loans.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.600]   I borrowed a bunch of money my sophomore year, played and didn't really do any work.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.440]   My junior year of college, I came back and I got all mixed up on why was I in school
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   at all?
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.440]   What was I going to study?
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   What was I doing?
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.760]   And so I had more loans and I had credit cards.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.020]   And what would happen is I would put my books and my gas on the credit card through the
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.640]   academic year and then during the summer, I'd be able to study and I would get it back
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640]   to zero.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.800]   So, I just said, "Wow, how much money would I have if I had no payments?"
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.440]   So I got motivated and I set myself a goal of getting out of debt.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.600]   And I set myself a goal of getting out of debt, if possible, I wanted to get out of
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.160]   debt before I graduated.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.480]   So all during my senior year of college, I worked a full-time job.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.720]   I worked 40 hours a week.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.080]   I went to class full-time.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.200]   I took 19 hours of class of all my senior capstone courses.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.560]   I saved.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.400]   I paid cash for my senior year of college.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.680]   I paid cash for some travel that I did as associated with the senior year.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.880]   I paid off my credit cards and two weeks before I graduated, I wrote a check to Sally Mae
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.920]   and graduated from school completely debt-free.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.480]   And it was freedom, right?
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   And it was awesome.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   It was really, really cool.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.920]   I was so proud of myself because I learned it was a stretching time for me to learn how
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.840]   to budget my time in such a way that I could be effective.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.120]   And I never, I was just blown away.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.360]   Graduated from school, took the opportunity, went on a road trip.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   Fast forward, cutting the story short, I continued to follow Dave's baby steps, excuse me, all
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   during the time while I was doing that, working like a maniac, working 40 hours a week.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   Dave Ramsey's show was my constant companion, my encouragement.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.280]   I was subscribed to his premium membership.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.520]   I had the three hours a day of the podcast with no commercials, and I listened every
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.740]   day to three hours of his show.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.760]   And it was a major encouragement for me all during that time.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.000]   And I learned a lot about finance.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.160]   I had always been a finance junkie before, but I learned a lot just hearing how he answered
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160]   questions.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.400]   Well, what happened is I went on and I wound up getting laid off from a job.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.320]   I had finished, what was it, baby step three, emergency fund.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   That made, I was out of debt.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   I had an emergency fund.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.600]   That's what allowed me to launch a financial planning practice.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:30.040]   Well, when I started working as a financial planner, I started, I tried to apply the same
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.200]   Dave Ramsey principles that had worked for me.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.080]   I literally carried, I would order his book, Total Money Maker, because it'd make such
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.360]   a big difference in my life.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.080]   I ordered his book by the case, and I would carry a case of those books around, 10 in
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   a case.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.280]   I would get the deal where they were 10 bucks a book, 100 bucks for 10 of them, and I would
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.120]   carry them around in my car.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.400]   And if I had a client or somebody who was struggling with debt, I couldn't really, in
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.720]   my practice, I couldn't really help them very much.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.200]   I didn't have the time to really work with them.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.000]   There was no compensation method where I could do it.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I couldn't work for free.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.520]   So I would give them a book and I'd say, "Look, this is my book."
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.000]   I gave it away for wedding presents.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.320]   I gave away audio books.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.960]   I would give it away as a wedding present, tuck $100 bills in the back of it.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.520]   This was my thing.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.880]   If you ask anyone that knows me, I was a raving fan.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.120]   The problem was when I started working as an advisor, I tried to apply the same approach
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.840]   that he used with real people, and I started to learn that it didn't work.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.920]   And it didn't work.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.680]   Maybe it didn't work because of my personality.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.360]   Maybe I was too aggressive, too abrasive.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.560]   Maybe I was too hardheaded.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.720]   I don't know.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:37.280]   But then what happened is I found out that nobody really follows the Dave Ramsey plan
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   as it's laid out.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.920]   Now, there's nothing in the Dave Ramsey plan, quote-unquote, and by that I am encompassing
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.880]   not just his book, but everything that I've ever heard for years while listening to him
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880]   talk on the radio.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.160]   There's nothing that can't work.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.820]   It's just simply that it doesn't work because people don't do it.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.720]   And so I had all these experiences where people come and say, "I'm a Dave Ramsey fan.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   I'm a Dave Ramsey fan.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   I'm following the Dave Ramsey plan."
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   And I say, "Awesome.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   I love Dave.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.200]   Dave made a big difference in my life."
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.160]   And then I asked them what they meant.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.840]   What happened is I learned that, "Wait a second.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.200]   You're not actually following the Dave Ramsey plan."
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.480]   So I learned because they had certain opinions about financial products, which is what I
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.480]   was doing.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.480]   I sold insurance.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.480]   I sold investments.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.440]   I did financial planning.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.600]   And so they had certain opinions about financial products because they were fun to follow the
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.600]   Dave Ramsey plan.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   Then I learned, "Wait a second.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.220]   You're not actually doing it."
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.760]   So I learned to say, "See, I actually followed the Dave Ramsey plan.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.960]   I didn't have any credit cards.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.760]   I had applied for a credit card on my 18th birthday.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.160]   I learned my lesson, closed all my credit cards after they were paid off.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.600]   I didn't have any credit cards.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.960]   I followed all of his things to the letter."
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.240]   And then I started learning that nobody was actually following it.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.640]   Then I started recognizing the Dave Ramsey plan is not what Dave Ramsey does.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.760]   So this is the problem with personal finance, is that what made Dave Ramsey rich is not
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.880]   following the Dave Ramsey plan.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.840]   What made Dave Ramsey rich was building a massive business, going deeply—well, first
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.640]   of all, going deeply into debt, being an idiot with his financing, screwing up royally, declaring
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.560]   bankruptcy to clear all of the debt, and then going on, pursuing a high-paying career—I'm
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.880]   sure he was a very effective real estate salesperson—pursuing a high-income career, building a business
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.820]   on the side, and the business on the side has ballooned to be huge.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.320]   But that's not what his books teach.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.720]   His books teach, "Save and invest 15% for retirement," not build a massive business.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.880]   Now, he does talk about business.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   He has a book, Entree Leadership.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.880]   It's a good book.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.880]   I read it.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.880]   So he does talk about that.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.480]   But the problem is, the whole personal finance industry, we sell something that we don't
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.160]   do in and of ourselves.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.200]   And so we sell this idea that, well, if we just get out of debt, and we just don't do
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   this, and we save 10%.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.240]   And what I found is that nobody actually—like, I would ask people, I was like, "Do you have
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.240]   credit cards?"
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.240]   "Well, yeah, I do."
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.240]   "Well, do you have a 15-year mortgage?"
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   "No, no, no, I do."
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.240]   "Wait a second."
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.920]   And I learned.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.600]   And the most disheartening one for me was—so here's how much I love that.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.160]   I bought for some of my friends, after I started reading his books and listening to his show,
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.120]   I bought Financial Peace University, and I organized a class for my friends going through
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.000]   the video class, because I wanted to help my friends.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.360]   And what I learned is—so I went through Financial Peace University.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   I guess what's the word?
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.800]   Proctored it or moderated it or whatever.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.600]   I organized it.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:14.040]   And unofficially, I bought the courses and played the DVDs for my friends.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.640]   But even like the high school curriculum, I watched a friend of mine who went through
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.120]   the high school curriculum, came home from school, and was so excited, yelling at his
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   parents, "You've got to get out of debt!"
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.120]   Dave says, "You've got to get out of debt."
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.640]   And I've heard, "Dave says blah blah blah blah blah," again and again.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.920]   And then I watched him.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.400]   He graduates from high school.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   Guess what?
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.240]   Six years later, he gets a big boy job.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.240]   Guess what?
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:38.360]   Goes out, leases a brand new BMW, destroying his financial life, because he feels good
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.680]   that he knows what Dave Ramsey does.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.240]   And so I started instituting this as my litmus test.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.480]   People say, "I follow the Dave Ramsey plan."
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.240]   My first question would be, "How many credit cards do you have?"
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   Nobody ever said zero.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.440]   Like, I was the only one who followed the Dave Ramsey plan, and the Dave Ramsey plan
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.960]   wasn't working in the sense that it wasn't actually being effective.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.800]   Now, there's no reason why it can't work.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.280]   It's just that it doesn't work, because people don't do it.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.080]   And that would be what Dave would say.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.600]   But then I got into deeper level of financial planning, and I started to gain some actual
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.080]   knowledge in working with clients.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.880]   Then I started looking at his recommendations.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.720]   And the problem is, he goes where he shouldn't go.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:24.160]   And by the way, cut me off and rebut at any point, because I don't want to be too harsh,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.880]   but I think we've got to recognize this, that he goes where he shouldn't go.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.240]   He's not a financial advisor, and yet he gives financial advice.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:37.120]   And if I gave some of the advice that he gives every day on the radio as a financial advisor,
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.280]   if I gave that advice, I would be completely disbarred.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.040]   I would lose my license in an instant.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.200]   I would have lawsuits on my hands, because the advice is flat out dangerous in some ways.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   And go ahead.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.320]   >> You want me to break in here?
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.640]   Because what I hear Dave Ramsey speaking is in general terms.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.440]   Now there are some exclusions to what he advises on what to invest in.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.760]   And of course, he teaches against the dangers of certain investments, like viaticals and
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.920]   annuities and things like that.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.500]   So you just used the word, the advice that he's giving on investing.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.800]   It's investing that we're talking about specifically, not to get out of debt plan, right?
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   >> Right.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.360]   And so that's where, and this is where if you talk to almost any financial advisor,
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.600]   or anybody who's interested, basically what I hear when I have these conversations, because
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.760]   you can't really, it's very dangerous to pick on Dave, because you get immediately qualified
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.440]   as a Dave hater.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:36.760]   And what happens is because if I had listened to me when I was caught in the cult of personality
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.280]   that is the Dave Ramsey show years ago, when I was listening for hours a day, consider
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.140]   that, he's someone who for three hours a day sewed into my life.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:49.400]   And I was, I mean, look how deeply my obsession went.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.560]   I mean, and how much I did, I would invite friends to his conference.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.880]   One time I had a friend that I invited to his conference in Tampa.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.920]   I drove to Tampa to see him speak.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.320]   And what happens is that I became attached to the person.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:07.560]   And once you're attached to any person, then you face a situation where you start to become
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:14.400]   blind to the facts of what they're saying, and you start to have allegiance to a person.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.280]   So that's where, what's dangerous is I wouldn't have listened to what I'm saying right now,
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.960]   because I would have said, no, Dave Ramsey's right.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.880]   But once I got a little bit disattached, and I kind of was able to pull back a little bit,
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.680]   and I started looking at the recommendations, I'm going to set even investing aside, because
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.440]   there's nothing in what he says that is necessarily wrong.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:38.000]   Can you buy mutual funds that are growth, aggressive growth, growth in income and international,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.200]   split your assets 25% between them, and choose mutual funds that have at least a five to
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.360]   10 year track record with a good mutual fund company?
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   You can.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.680]   Is there any reason why it won't work?
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   I don't think so.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.640]   I think it's as good as many other approaches.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.960]   So from that perspective, I don't, a lot of financial advice would be really upset with
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.920]   me for right now on that.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.420]   But I don't have any problem with that.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:05.200]   What I have a problem though with is teaching people to expect a 12% rate of return.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.360]   And so something like that.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.000]   The one thing you can do that will get the SEC on your back is if you falsely promise
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.960]   rates of return that are not accurate.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.960]   And so here's the thing.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.480]   He ignores so much very important detail.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.720]   When I have a client come into my office, so we all, if you're interested at all in
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:28.540]   personal finance, you will often hear something like, you'll hear of the 4% rule.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.980]   And the 4% rule is very well known.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.740]   It's based upon what's called the Trinity study, which was a study that three professors
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.820]   at Trinity College put together, which they basically went back and modeled and they said,
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:43.180]   what would be a distribution rate of a portfolio that is sustainable over time?
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.460]   So this is as good as that now, that is flawed.
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.460]   And without going into the details, that there are tons of problems in that, that lots of
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.820]   people smarter than I talk about.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.240]   Let's use that as a proxy.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:25:00.780]   So a financial advisor who is careful would probably very rarely go higher than a 4% distribution
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.360]   rate from a portfolio.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:07.040]   And even that, I would be uncomfortable with that if the only asset were mutual funds and
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.120]   we were basing it on that.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.560]   Because there are flaws in that, especially in today's investing environment.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.640]   But that's a financial advisor who would usually not go over 4%.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.540]   Well what happened is I had someone say, well I read Dave Ramsey's book, Total Money Makeover,
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.240]   and what Dave Ramsey says is you can average 12% on your mutual funds.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.700]   And you can average 12% on your mutual funds and you account for, you lose 4% to inflation.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.620]   So therefore you can pull 8% off of your portfolio every year.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.480]   That is flat out dangerous.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.220]   Because when most advisors will say 4%, and he's saying you can expect 12 minus 4% of
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.420]   inflation and take 8, that's flat out dangerous.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.420]   And so you have, and there are far smarter financial advisors than me that write these
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.700]   things very carefully, very carefully, very scientifically.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.900]   What happens is you can't get past the cult of personality.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:58.140]   And so the people who are very engaged in his community, they're engaged around a person,
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.640]   not around ideas.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   And that's what's dangerous.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.700]   Now you could go on to other areas.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.680]   And so whether it's something like life insurance.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.820]   So life insurance, everyone wants to get into the life insurance conversation.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.500]   Most of the time they want to talk about the type of life insurance.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.900]   Term life insurance, whole life insurance.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.080]   I don't care about that conversation.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.020]   Because what you actually find when you actually do life insurance planning is that asking
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:26.220]   if you should buy term life insurance or whether you should buy whole life insurance and comparing
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.580]   them, they are completely incompatible.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.360]   It's like asking, I mean the example that I give, it's like asking should I rent a car,
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.220]   should I lease a car, or should I buy a car?
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.900]   So an example, and I'll give you this example because I just found this to make it be the
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.220]   most sense.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.460]   To me when I was trying to research and trying to think my way through it, if you come to
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.820]   FinCon and you're going to be here for a week and you need a car to drive because you're
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.340]   going to travel around Louisiana, does it make sense for you to rent a car, lease a
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.340]   car, or buy a car?
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.500]   You rent a car, right?
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.460]   Now if you're going to move to Louisiana for a year and you're just doing some business
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.980]   project, you need a car to drive while you're here, and you need a nice car while you're
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.860]   going to be traveling around with clients, does it make sense to rent a car, lease a
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.940]   car, buy a car?
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.380]   Most Dave Ramsey fans would say never lease a car because that's a waste of money.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.380]   I would lease a car.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.700]   You could negotiate a one-year lease or something like that.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.660]   You're traveling in, you're renting an apartment, you're doing some temporary point.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.020]   So I'll concede the point.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.760]   Most Dave Ramsey fans would say never lease a car.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.900]   This is a cardinal rule.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.420]   But most people would say, "I'm just renting a car for a year because I don't want to buy
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.420]   a car.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.420]   I don't want to maintain two things."
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:30.540]   Now if you're going to buy a car for 20 years, and you're going to drive a car for 20 years
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.020]   and you've got maybe a 10-year-old son or daughter that you're going to pass a car onto,
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.180]   you're going to buy a car and you're going to own it for a long period of time.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.740]   That's the difference between term life insurance and permanent life insurance.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.740]   They're radically different because they do different things.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:50.780]   And so if you are looking for an insurance policy to cover a five-year business buyout,
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.060]   you've bought a business from someone, you're paying a series of payments, they're going
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.740]   to buy a five-year term policy on your life.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.860]   There's no question about it.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.180]   If you are buying a life insurance policy to fund an irrevocable life insurance trust
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.900]   to fund your estate taxes, there's not a chance in the world you would fund that with a term
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.220]   policy over the long term.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.900]   That's going to be a permanent policy.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.100]   So I don't want to get any deeper into that because what happens is people get really
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.100]   upset about it.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.140]   But let me focus on numbers.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:18.220]   When you actually do a life insurance calculation properly, you sit down and there are three
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.500]   major ways to do it.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.580]   The best of which is doing a needs analysis, which is actually if you die, what do you
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.580]   actually need?
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.420]   What debt do you want to pay off?
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   What income do you need?
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.420]   For how long?
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.420]   What are the resources that are available?
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.620]   It's called a needs analysis.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.700]   What Dave recommends is a multiple of income approach.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.580]   So he says buy 8 to 10 times your income of life insurance.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.380]   Now what's that number based upon?
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.060]   That number is based upon the 12% rate of return.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.500]   So he says buy 8 to 10 times your income of life insurance.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:49.340]   So let's say you make $100,000 a year, buy 10 times your income of life insurance.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.380]   That gives you a million dollars of life insurance.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.140]   You invest that at 12% per year.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.540]   You get $120,000 of income.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.500]   And then that pays your taxes and inflation and you wind up with $100,000.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.540]   But that number, is it good enough to put in a book?
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.540]   Yeah, it is.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.740]   And that's why he does it.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.980]   But the problem is then that becomes the cardinal rule.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.100]   And so a Dave Ramsey fan will come into my office and I'll say, "Joshua, let's calculate
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   it."
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.100]   And I'll say, "Let me show you how to do a needs analysis."
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.820]   And he'll say, "No, Dave says I need 8 to 10 times your income."
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:18.960]   Well, I'm sorry, if you're 22 years old or 25 years old and you have a couple of kids,
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.920]   you need more like 20 times your income of life insurance.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.820]   And if you're 55 years old, you probably need less than 8 if you are wealthy.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.180]   So you may not need any.
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.780]   So what happens is that these "rules" because of the cult of personality, instead of teaching
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.460]   people, "Here's how you approach it," which is what I'm trying to do, and I don't know
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.460]   if I can do it.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:42.380]   By the way, after doing a podcast, I have a world of respect for Dave that I never had
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.380]   before.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.380]   It is tough to be a broadcaster.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.540]   And it's tough because you're on the record for everything.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.260]   And it is a constant challenge.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:54.300]   So I have a world of respect that I probably never had before starting my show.
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:59.060]   But what happens is I just wish that he and all of us who are in this space, instead of
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.020]   telling people, "Here's what you should do," we would treat people like adults and teach
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.900]   them what we know and teach them how to arrive at their own conclusions and their answers.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.780]   But what happens is that's bad marketing.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.140]   Because then instead of being attached to our brand, then people are attached to the
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.140]   fact that they can do it themselves.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.380]   But that's what we need to be doing.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.580]   >> Well, let's go back to the question I had.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.260]   Is there any one book with all the answers?
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.260]   I mean, we all know the truth is really only the Bible, but the rest of them are all great
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.140]   advice and you can follow the advice in there.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.060]   But there's always going to be something else to be learned from another book.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.540]   Isn't that the same way with Dave Ramsey's advice?
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.300]   He's writing a book for everybody, but it can't be for everybody.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.680]   You say the advice is dangerous.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.100]   I can see that it's not going to be perfect for everybody.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.740]   But I don't see how it's harmful for somebody unless they have different goals as far as
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:54.780]   I'm not looking to retire, save for my retirement, I'm not looking to, well, it's a choice if
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.820]   you want to pay for your kid's college, the baby steps.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.020]   So you're saying it's dangerous, though.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.300]   There's other education out there, and none of the answers are going to be any one book.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.740]   And Dave's even written more than one book.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.900]   How can you say that Total Money Maker has all the answers?
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.700]   That's what I'm trying to say here is there's no one answer in one book because there's
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.180]   going to be a variety of people, variables in the game here.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.580]   People have different goals.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.340]   We could go back with the 12% discussion if you want.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:30.580]   But I think that an educated consumer is a better consumer, and that's why we do multiple
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.580]   podcasts.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.580]   It's not just one show.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.660]   It's not one audio recording somebody downloads and listens to over and over again.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:42.540]   We're educating people on a cycle, which his radio show does as well, which is heard by
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.860]   what, five, six million people?
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:50.100]   So he has to give general advice, and it's up to the consumer to take the advice that
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.780]   they choose.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:58.420]   And so I don't see where it's as dangerous as most people sound like they're saying.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.060]   Maybe I need to give the mic back to you and let you talk about that.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.740]   Here would be what I would say as an example.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:07.780]   So there are three large, there are many financial radio shows.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.540]   There are many one hour a week show on Saturday mornings, a local financial advisor is buying
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.060]   air time, and that's, so I don't have any familiarity with those.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:20.980]   But there are three large national radio shows, all of which are dealing with financial topics.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.500]   I would invite you and others to listen to the difference in these shows.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.540]   So the big dog is Dave Ramsey.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.060]   Then you have Clark Howard, and you have Rick Edelman.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.300]   Now if you go and listen to how they approach their show, there is a dramatic difference
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.420]   between them.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:45.400]   So and you have basically, in my opinion, you have three different levels of professionalism
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.460]   and experience on behalf of the broadcaster.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.260]   On the one end you have Rick Edelman.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.300]   Rick Edelman is a financial advisor.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.860]   He owns a massive financial planning firm, and he has a tremendous amount of experience
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.420]   as a financial advisor, and he added broadcasting on to his practice as a marketing method for
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.540]   his firm.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:08.660]   Clark Howard comes not from a financial background as a financial advisor, but he comes from
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.220]   being interested in finance and being very careful, and he has learned a lot and knows
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.220]   a lot.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.900]   Dave Ramsey comes from the perspective of primarily talking about budgeting and debt
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.580]   from his experience with his mistakes, but with the exception of a college degree in
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.660]   finance, which evidently he has, he has no other formal experience or formal qualifications
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.660]   in the world of financial planning.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:33.380]   Now I would invite you to go and listen to how they handle financial topics, and you
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.300]   will notice a dramatic difference between the three.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.940]   What Rick Edelman does, I probably most respect and admire what Rick Edelman does, because
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:49.100]   when a caller calls Rick Edelman, as a financial advisor who can be held more accountable because
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:54.020]   he is a financial advisor than Dave Ramsey can be, who is an entertainer, if you listen
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.060]   to how he answers a question, a caller will call in and ask him a question, and if it
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.340]   seems simple, he'll answer it in a simple way.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:07.940]   He'll usually probe a little bit more and try to find out some more technical details,
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.900]   and then he will often say, "That's a really complicated question.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:15.540]   I would invite you to call my office and speak with one of my planners."
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.620]   Here in general is what you would need to know to make the decision, though, but there
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.760]   are a lot of detailed facts that you would need to find out.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.240]   So I'm going to pick on the hot button topic, and this will get me in trouble, but something
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.240]   like life insurance.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:32.060]   If you ask any experienced life insurance agent, life insurance is not a simple thing.
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:36.860]   It's one of the most complicated financial products ever invented, and it is worse because
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.940]   they get more and more complicated all the time.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.180]   There are great policies and there are terrible policies.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:45.220]   There are great companies and there are awful companies, and until you are really an expert
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.580]   in life insurance, it's very difficult to identify between them.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:53.740]   But if you listen to how Rick Edelman answers the question, he will generally probe, and
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:59.140]   then he'll say, "This is one where you've got to review your actual policy," and he's
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.860]   very quick to send people to his firm.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.180]   Now, that may seem like he's just sending people to his firm because, "I need to build
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.180]   business for my firm."
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.380]   But he'll tell you, he answers the question when it can be answered, but when it can't
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.220]   be answered, he sends someone to an advisor.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:15.460]   Clark Howard will get the same question, and Clark is quicker to give a simpler answer,
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.500]   but Clark is quick to acknowledge if the question is more complex.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.820]   And Clark will say, "Listen, that's a really great question.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.820]   I'm not sure I can answer it.
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:27.060]   I would invite you to, I would encourage you, call a fee-only planner, and you really need
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.520]   to get some good advice on your situation because I don't know the answer."
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.100]   And so if someone calls up and tells Clark, "Hey, listen, I've got this policy," he'll
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.700]   say, "Listen, well, these types of policies are generally not so good, but hey, if you've
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.100]   had this kind of policy and it fits these parameters, then maybe it would be good."
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.220]   When someone calls Dave, Dave is reckless with how he does it.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:49.940]   I know I'm using a strong word, not to be critical.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.900]   It is being critical.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.940]   It's an accurate word.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.940]   Dave has a rule.
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.660]   If you have a whole life insurance policy, sell it.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.660]   That's his rule.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:01.940]   He will never tell somebody, "Take a look at the actual policy and see where you are
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.020]   in the life cycle versus the expenses versus the cost."
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:09.860]   So Dave, I've heard him say to somebody, "Cancel a policy that's a mature policy, that this
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:15.260]   policy is growing at several percentage points per year over any other safe investment that
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.380]   you could have, and use that money to pay down your mortgage at 2%.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.660]   That makes no mathematical sense."
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.820]   And he goes into all the financial, mutual funds versus the mortgage and the risk calculation.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.340]   Baloney, guaranteed returns in excess of your mortgage payment, that's a very different
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.340]   thing.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.980]   You can't just add that with mortgage payments.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:37.380]   I'm walking on thin ice here, even bringing up any specific examples, but I'm trying to
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:42.900]   give a little bit of, not just say it's right, and Josh was in a war with him, because I'm
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.660]   not, but trying to give examples.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:50.780]   Dave goes much farther than he should with entertainment.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.460]   And there's a big difference between being able to listen to somebody and say, "Listen,
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:59.220]   I'm really struggling with my finances with my spouse, and we're not budgeting really
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.780]   well, and my spouse seems like he or she is spending recklessly, and we're not on the
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.100]   same page."
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.340]   That's advice that's very personal, and that works well to entertainment.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.500]   But when you get off the ditch into detailed, complex financial planning, and you have no
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.780]   experience and no formal qualifications, by the way, I don't believe that formal qualifications
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.660]   are the key, but formal qualifications are a way for the public to judge what somebody
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.500]   knows and what somebody doesn't know.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.580]   And I'm not sure that Dave could pass a CFP exam.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.660]   I'm really not.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:32.300]   Because when I listen to him, it's like, "Wow, what on earth, where does that come from?"
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.140]   You just ignored all these other things that you should know about, but it seems like you
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.260]   don't know.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.540]   So the problem is, though, that you have an audience.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.940]   And with this, I'll just wrap up what I'm saying and give you a chance to respond, and
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:50.420]   then hopefully we can, if I've ticked off the whole world, hopefully I can gain a little
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.500]   bit of back.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.220]   But what I always tell people is you've got to look at the audience of a show, and the
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.220]   audience.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:05.900]   And the challenge is that we are so bereft as a culture of any financial knowledge, any
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.340]   financial knowledge.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.920]   We are not taught formally anything.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.980]   And those who are trying to teach something formally have such an agenda, oftentimes,
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.540]   that the opinion is so skewed that we don't have any tools of defense.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.380]   We don't have any critical thinking or any knowledge or any tools of defense.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:30.060]   And this is one of the key things that I observe, is that as a public, as a general population,
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:35.220]   the general IQ of the general population is so low, it's so easy to be bamboozled.
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.580]   And so if Dave would admit that what I'm working with is I'm trying to work with the general
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:44.060]   population because I'm doing a mainstream radio show, working with people who are listening
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.140]   in their cars as they're driving around, and I'm working with kind of an entry level to
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:53.100]   finance, and then if he would be careful when he gets into the more advanced topics, and
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.780]   if he would make a referral that wasn't just call my investing ELP, you know, who that
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.900]   person is going to have the heart of a teacher because they're going to teach you about investments.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:09.300]   And oh, by the way, you know, if it went, if it went, if he didn't just give a nod to
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.540]   that, but he actually said, call somebody who can get to know your situation, which
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.540]   is the key.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.740]   You've got to look at your situation.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.740]   Then it would be great.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.180]   But he doesn't do that.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.380]   And that's what frustrates, that's what frustrates the financial community, especially the community
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.700]   professional financial advisors.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.220]   Because I would say that many people agree with so many things, but there are some very
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.800]   important deeper level things.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.020]   And if he would just make, if he would, if he would not go into the technical things
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.140]   where it displays his ignorance, either ignorance or willful, just and I know it's again, a
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:48.220]   strong word is either ignorance or it's willful agenda, willful promotion of agenda.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.220]   I don't know.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.340]   Then I think it would be great.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:56.900]   And that's what I would love to see him do because he has helped millions of people radically
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.780]   transform their lives, my own included and yours too.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.780]   Right.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.180]   So he has been a huge help and I want to give him full credit for that.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:11.660]   But I hate to see, it's kind of like, I feel like it's as though if we don't, if we don't,
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:20.180]   we who have been helped and have been encouraged by that, if we don't hold our own people accountable,
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.780]   then what happens is we run the risk of losing any credibility.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.020]   And I'll give, you're a Christian, so right.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.700]   So okay, I'll give a, I'll give a spiritual example.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:34.180]   If some person says, I'm a great man of God, or I'm a great woman of God, and they're out
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:38.860]   preaching in the streets, A, on a scriptural perspective, that person is held to a higher
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:43.060]   standard and rightly so.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:49.320]   But if we wink at the infidelity, if we wink at a priest that abuses little boys, or if
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:55.140]   we wink at a pastor that has an adulterous relationship with their spouse, or if we wink
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.220]   at sin, who are we if we don't clean up our own industry?
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:06.380]   And that's kind of what I feel like is that I feel so timid that like I'm not qualified
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.980]   in many ways to judge Dave.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:14.140]   I'm really not, because his level of experience and success has gone so far beyond my own
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.140]   that it's much easier for me to sit down and shut up.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:22.580]   But the problem is that we have to hold people accountable, and we have to look accurately.
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:29.540]   And I would just love to see him adjust his message and acknowledge the fact that I'm
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:35.140]   working with a mainstream audience and be quicker to be slow with giving financial planning
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.480]   advice with his knowledge.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   So that would be my thoughts.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   Hopefully that makes sense.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.780]   >> You know, I keep coming up with all these questions as you're talking, but I keep listening
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.540]   because you keep bringing on new stuff, big stuff, and you keep moving the conversation
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.540]   farther.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.980]   It's hard to go back to that.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.980]   You were talking about -- I'm just going to make a statement here.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.500]   I don't know how to make it a question, and I forget what it was when I was thinking about
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.500]   it.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.180]   You were talking about Rick Edelman's advice, Clark Howard's advice, Dave Ramsey's advice.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.740]   And admittedly, I'm a Dave Ramsey fan.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.740]   I went through counselor training.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.420]   I teach financial peace at the university.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:11.060]   I'm a huge Dave Ramsey fan, so I am in the Dave Ramsey camp, you could say.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.620]   I do believe that there are different situations for everybody, and there may be a situation
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:18.120]   where Baby Steps doesn't work for a specific person.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.500]   And I highly recommend everybody educate themselves on this stuff, and that's where I'm going
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.720]   to go with this.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.940]   With Rick Edelman, you were talking about how Rick Edelman will answer the question,
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.940]   but he'll also direct them to his own firm.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.340]   Whether that's a conflict of interest, I don't see it as a conflict of interest.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.300]   He's directing people to get more education and help in their situation.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.300]   Brilliant.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.300]   Love it.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   That's what he'll need to do.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.500]   Clark Howard, you said, he will answer the question, but he'll also say, you know, go
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.720]   talk to somebody.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.180]   I don't listen to Clark Howard very often anymore, so I don't know who he's directing
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.180]   to.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.180]   Who does he direct those people to?
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.760]   He will usually, Clark will usually make a referral to a fee-only financial planner,
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.580]   and he will usually mention either an organization called the Garrett Financial Planning Network,
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:02.580]   which is an organization of fee-only hourly planners, or NAPFA, which stands for National
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.540]   Association of Personal Financial Advisors, which is also a fee-only organization.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:10.500]   So he's directing them to fee-only advisors, which I don't have any problem with that either,
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.340]   because the individual, the consumer, the customer is going to find specific advice
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.740]   to their situation.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:22.300]   When you go to Dave Ramsey, he gives you the direction to go check in with one of his ELPs,
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:27.060]   which is essentially doing the same as Clark and as Rick, because he's directing them to
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:32.140]   people who are kind of in his network, like Rick Edelman, or to somebody outside of his
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.660]   network, like Clark Howard, but he's saying it in a more general term.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.100]   Maybe I'm not saying that right.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.120]   But these people have been fleshed out because they teach the same thing that he does.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:47.260]   So in other words, he's giving advice to go speak to somebody that he knows is going to
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.340]   educate that consumer before they go and invest in anything.
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.740]   And that's one thing he says over and over again, is not just go to get help from somebody
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.780]   who has the heart of a teacher, but to learn about the stuff.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.780]   Don't buy something you don't understand.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.260]   You'll hear him say it over and over again.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:08.340]   So it's not that he's not answering the question, and it's not that he's saying just trust my
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.340]   advisor and go with what he says.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.940]   He always says, basically, learn for yourself what you're getting into so that you don't
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.340]   get bamboozled.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.660]   Right.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:23.840]   I, if he has changed in the last couple of years, I have not heard more than 20, 30 minutes
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.060]   of his show in the last couple of years, just because it's difficult for me to listen to
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.180]   because I get frustrated.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:34.340]   And I have learned to simply to keep my sanity, to walk away from things that frustrate me.
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.780]   And I'm generally a happier person.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.460]   I feel the same way about Susie Orman.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.460]   Okay, good.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.460]   All right.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.060]   She gives some great advice, but once it's on the credit score thing, I'm gone.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:47.780]   So I have no connection with her because with the exception of flipping through her books,
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.780]   I don't watch TV.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.460]   I don't pay any attention to her.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.380]   So that's why I'm completely unqualified to talk about what she talks about.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.300]   And here we are, two guys who don't have a big national radio show, and we're ragging
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.700]   on these two successful people.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.140]   I know what it looks like.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.140]   Yeah, correct.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.140]   You got to acknowledge that.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.980]   But then for somebody to use that as a total ad hominem argument, and it's fallacy.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:09.140]   So that's why I'm trying very hard to focus not on who I am, but on what I say and let
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.500]   the listener judge for themselves.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:16.260]   So I'm trying to stay with, I'm trying to avoid using an appeal to expertise or to use
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.260]   myself and promote myself as being somebody I'm not.
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.260]   I am young.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.260]   I'm inexperienced.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.460]   I have some experience in the financial planning world, but I have nowhere near as much experience
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:26.460]   as Dave.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.540]   I am a brand new broadcaster who has much to learn.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:34.460]   But still, that should not and does not diminish the validity of my arguments.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.340]   So I just would encourage people to consider my arguments, not me.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:46.260]   To answer your question, I have never heard Dave say, "You need to call a financial planner,
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.820]   and here is the line for my ELP."
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:49.820]   Maybe he does.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.860]   And if he does, I fully give him credit for that.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.420]   So it is his ELP you're saying?
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.420]   Right.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:59.860]   What he is saying, in general, in advertisement, if you need help with investing, then go ahead
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.460]   and call my group of ELPs.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.860]   There is not generally in the broader financial planning community, there is not generally
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:13.180]   a high regard for the caliber of the, for the quality of his investing ELPs.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.700]   I don't know anything about the other programs.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.200]   I have no idea if his real estate agents are as great as he says they are.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.860]   But there's not a high regard in the broader investment community for the technical ability
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:28.820]   or the high level of professional expertise of his ELP program.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.420]   But just make audience aware.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.140]   And again, I've not talked with the exception of one of his ELPs, and people have asked
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.140]   me, "Joshua, why don't you go join this program?"
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:40.060]   And I have my reasons for not, I don't want to be involved in this program.
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.820]   But the, and the reason, one of many reasons I don't want to be involved in this program
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.900]   is because then somebody comes in, and this is one of his ELPs that I spoke with, you
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.500]   know, then your clients are schooled to be looking for a 12 percent mutual fund.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.500]   And so guess what?
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   They're looking for 12 percent.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.900]   And when you don't deliver 12 percent, you lose the client.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.900]   And you have false expectations.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:05.180]   And it's a very, I would not want to work with somebody who are coming from that perspective.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.180]   So --
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:09.300]   I don't want to break your thought there, because I want to ask this of you, because
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.800]   I have talked to a couple people before about that.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.980]   And that's what I believe is that the reason why the financial planners don't like the
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:19.740]   whole discussion of 12 percent is, now you have to tell me, are we looking at 10 year,
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.740]   20 year track record?
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.780]   Where is that 12 percent that you're saying you can't get coming from?
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:30.660]   I'm saying is that, if you look, so what Dave's answer would be, unless he's changed in the
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.140]   last couple years, Dave would say, listen, I own many mutual funds that have returned
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.220]   in excess of 12 percent.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:42.740]   All you got to do is sit down with Morningstar, have your advisor run a return of the 12 percent,
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:43.980]   and you'll get that.
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:49.700]   So I own, I sold it recently, but for many years I owned a mutual fund called, I no longer
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.780]   own it, it's not a recommendation to the fund.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.260]   I liked it, and I think it's a good, instructive example.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.020]   I own a mutual fund called the Investment Company of America.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.060]   >> Yeah, I own that too.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.780]   I will say, I own that, and I like it.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.100]   >> All right, so you can say that I can't.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:10.300]   So I own that fund called Investment Company of America, and it's put out by American Funds.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:15.300]   If you look at their literature on the fund, the fund was, its inception date was either
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:19.660]   1926 or 1930, somewhere in the mid-1920s.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:24.460]   It's lifetime performance, the last time I looked, from then up through today, is about
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.140]   12 percent.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.020]   But what 12 percent, so that's the return of the fund.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:34.340]   But what 12 percent ignores is A, that's a loaded fund, so it's going to come with a
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:39.140]   sales commission, and that sales commission on that fund would be anywhere from zero percent
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:45.100]   up to as high as 5.75 percent, depending on the amount of money that you have to invest.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.980]   Well, that sales commission makes a dramatic difference in the return of the fund, because
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.140]   you have to account for that commission.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:55.340]   Now, if you have a million bucks, American Funds will waive all the sales commissions,
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.500]   so you can break point out of it, but that has to be accounted.
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.740]   Number two is it doesn't account for expense ratios.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:06.060]   So American Funds has excellently low expense ratios, but the 12 percent does not acknowledge
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.860]   the expense ratios.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.140]   That's a gross return.
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:13.740]   And so when you look at the, depending on which number, you can go through that.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.540]   But once you take out expenses for the management of the fund, you're not at 12 percent anymore.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:22.260]   And that fund is, when you actually look at the history, and this is where it's very difficult
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.780]   to look at what actually, what number you should actually use.
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:31.460]   If you generalize the S&P 500 and say, okay, well the S&P 500 over the last 60, 70, 80,
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.800]   whatever number you use, it's about 10 percent rate of return.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.260]   But that doesn't mean that the average investor gets 10 percent, and that has nothing to do
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.460]   with being able to count on the 12 percent every year.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.740]   So if you run a financial calculation, and I assume a 12 percent rate of return every
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.020]   year, A, it's not possible.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:52.860]   But B, it leads to such inflated numbers about how much money somebody needs to save that
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.620]   is nowhere near accurate.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.180]   So when I run a rate of return calculation for retirement, I'm far more likely to use
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.540]   six or seven percent, unless a client can convince me that I should use a higher number.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.940]   And this is what happens, is that if you actually run, if you actually run the calculations.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.820]   >> Are you seriously pulling out a calculator right now?
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.220]   >> I'm looking to see if I have it.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.820]   >> Are you looking, you're looking for a calculator.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.820]   Unbelievable.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.820]   >> I should, here we go.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:14.820]   So let me give you just an example.
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:15.820]   >> We've got 10 minutes left.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.820]   >> Right.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.940]   So let me give you an example.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:26.740]   So this would be, so if I were Dave, and I were saying, okay, let's say how much money
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:29.220]   we can invest over time, and how much it can grow to.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:33.380]   So let's say that I'm a 25-year-old man, I'm talking about from 25 to 65, we're going to
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:34.940]   invest $100 a month.
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.980]   So let's clear this, let's do $100 per month, and let's put it in for 40 years, and let's
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.220]   use a 12 percent annual number.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.220]   >> 1.176.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:43.220]   >> 1.176.
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:44.220]   >> I already know that.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.220]   >> Is that the number?
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.220]   >> That's the number.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.220]   >> Okay.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:50.020]   So let me just run the math, because I'm not as quick as you.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:56.980]   So let's do 40 years, invested monthly, 10 percent, $100 per month, starting with nothing.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:01.180]   At the end of 40 years, that number would be, oh, I used 10 percent, excuse me, just
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.180]   a moment.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.220]   So let's put in 12 percent.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:08.700]   At 12 percent, at the end of 40 years, that number would be $1,188,242.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.900]   Now if you run that number at 10, okay, so let's just drop it to 10 percent, that number
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.700]   is now $637,000.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.260]   That is a 50 percent difference between 10 percent and 12 percent.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:24.420]   The average investor, you have to fact check me on this, but the average investor in the
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:29.820]   average mutual fund gets about, last 20-year study I saw from Dalbar Lipper, gets about
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.820]   like 3.6.
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.580]   >> Okay, but forgive me for interrupting here, because when we talk about following Dave
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:39.740]   Ramsey's advice, you will not be saving $100 for 40 years, $100 a month.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.740]   It will always be $100 a month as just the example of, you know, everybody can become
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.740]   a millionaire.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:51.220]   What he teaches is to get out of debt, save up an emergency fund, and then start to invest
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.620]   in your retirement, which is 15 percent of income, which will always be more than $100
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.620]   a month.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.660]   So you're going to get to a million dollars.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:02.100]   Yes, maybe the 12 percent is a different rate of return.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.460]   I don't care which way.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.180]   I know that we're going to be millionaires eventually, because we're saving more money
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.660]   than $100 a month.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.660]   >> Right.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.820]   And so you can get rich on a low income.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:16.140]   I did a show, one of my favorite shows that I did on my show is I said how I'd become
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.540]   a millionaire on a minimum wage job at Walmart.
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.540]   So --
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:20.540]   >> I think I missed that one.
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.540]   >> Yeah, go check it.
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.540]   It's a fun one.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.540]   >> Is it a three-hour show?
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.540]   >> No, it's about an hour and 20 minutes.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:25.540]   So it should fit.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.540]   Listen to it at 2x speed.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.900]   That's what I do.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.500]   So it's how I would become a millionaire on a minimum wage job at Walmart.
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:35.620]   >> So we're going to get lost in the weeds if we do too much math.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.620]   Let me just avoid the rate of return conversation.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.260]   Just simply say that I would encourage people to do their own research.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:49.420]   I would never use 12 percent in any calculation, period, for a financial planning client.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.660]   And I don't know a single financial planner.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.820]   Now, we could all be crooks.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:56.140]   We could all be ignorant.
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.260]   We could all not have access to Morningstar.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:00.200]   We could all -- so you'd have to judge for yourself.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:06.420]   I don't know a single financial planner who would ever use 12 percent in any kind of calculation.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:10.300]   So I would just leave it at that and encourage people to do their own research.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.740]   But even something like the 15 percent, I'll tell you, one of the things where I feel betrayed
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.780]   is that I saved 15 percent.
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:17.940]   Where does this number come from?
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.420]   It took me years to figure out where this number comes from.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.420]   15 percent.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.700]   And this is where you'd get the problem.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.500]   And I want to be very honest.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.500]   You get the --
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.500]   >> Do you want the answer?
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.500]   Because I want to tell you what I think it is.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:28.500]   And I'll see if you've got --
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.500]   >> Sure.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.700]   >> -- the answer is that it allows you to save a good chunk of money without taking
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.500]   away from reaching your other goals following the baby steps.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.500]   >> Right.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.700]   So I would say here's where the answer is.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:40.700]   And it's different.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:41.700]   My answer is different.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.580]   >> I knew it would be.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:50.260]   >> And if you go and you run a chart, and the two best people who have this, which I
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:55.060]   don't have the chart on my site, but I would give two resources for listeners.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.660]   Either go and read a book by -- you're the two most accessible.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:04.180]   Go and read a blog post on Mr. Money Mustache called "The Shockingly Simple Math Behind
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.180]   Retirement."
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.860]   Or go and read the same chart in Jacob Lundfisker's book "Early Retirement Extreme."
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.300]   It's probably also on his website.
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.460]   But Money Mustache's is the more common.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.620]   He does a good job of putting the numbers behind the charts.
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:21.580]   What you'll find is that if you save a percentage of income at a certain rate of growth over
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:25.020]   time -- and I'm going to stay out of the weeds with the numbers.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:30.180]   If you save 10% of your income, it takes you about 45 years to be financially independent.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.660]   If you save 15% of your income, it takes you about 40 years to be financially independent.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:39.500]   So if you start at 25, and then if you work until 65, and you save 15% of your income,
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.500]   you'll be financially independent.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.780]   But the problem is, what do you do if you're 45?
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:44.780]   What do you do if you're 52?
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.960]   So he says saving 15% when you're 40 years old is pointless.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.060]   You will never get -- you will never be retired at 65.
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:57.160]   So instead of saying to somebody, "Start with 15% as a good role, but you should sit down
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.980]   with a good financial planner, or you should learn how to run a financial planning calculator,
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:04.700]   and calculate an actual amount of money that you need to hit your retirement goal," people
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.380]   save happily 15% and say, "Dave told me I'm going to be rich.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.380]   Dave said I'm going to be rich by 15%."
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.820]   So I recognize the problem of putting everything in a book.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:12.820]   You can't.
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.700]   And that's the problem, is you can't put everything in a book.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:15.700]   And that's exactly right.
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:20.220]   So "Total Money Makeover" still, to this day, is the most motivational book I know about
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.220]   getting out of debt.
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.900]   I don't know how Dave did it.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:27.220]   I've got to go and dissect it and see if I can learn, because I want to learn how to
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:30.680]   motivate people like he does with that book.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:36.700]   But you can do that without crossing the line and giving advice that doesn't make any sense.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.380]   And it's like there are so many things.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.900]   I'll give you one last example and then answer any questions.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:45.900]   >> I still want to hear how you came up with figuring out what the 15% represents.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:46.900]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:47.900]   So good answer.
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:51.740]   So the average person graduating from college, saving 15%, will be financially independent
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:52.740]   at 65.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.740]   That's it.
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:54.740]   That's what the number is based upon.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:56:00.260]   So every financial plan that I run for a 20-something-year-old, they need to save about 15% of their income.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.420]   But it's dramatically different if they're 34, or if they're 44.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:07.580]   >> Now, that 15% rate changes, though, at baby step seven once they pay off the house.
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.580]   >> Right.
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:13.300]   But baby step seven is so entirely nebulous that no one knows what it means.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.100]   Save and invest, give money away and become rich.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:20.060]   >> Yeah, and that's where he leaves it wide open, wide open for however much you can throw
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.060]   in there.
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.860]   >> I don't want to go into the weeds on that because I have no problem with the seven baby
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:24.860]   steps.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:25.860]   They are as good a plan as any.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.860]   They really are.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.300]   I have no problem with them.
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.940]   What happens is that, and I sit down and I'm like, "Well, what would I give?"
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.480]   I don't have anything better than what Dave says as far as the steps.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.340]   My steps say, "What are your goals?" and create an actual financial plan.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.340]   But I don't have seven steps.
[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.860]   They're as good as any other seven steps out there.
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.300]   I have no problem with them.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.380]   My problem is on the specific financial planning recommendations.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.340]   I'll give you one last one.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:50.620]   Have you heard, when does Dave say to buy long-term care insurance?
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.620]   Remember?
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.620]   >> Right away.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:53.820]   Oh, long-term care, I'm sorry.
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:54.820]   It's age 60.
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.100]   >> Age 60, right.
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:57:00.860]   So this bothered me because I always used to hear his advice and then I started selling
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.820]   long-term care insurance.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:08.920]   I have looked high and low to find why age 60 is suddenly the magic date.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   I can't find.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.340]   If anyone can send it to me, I would be interested.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.320]   Email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:18.220]   You send me the study that would illustrate why age 60 is the age to buy long-term care
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.220]   insurance.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:23.780]   Now, what Dave would say, and I also have heard, I think, Susie Orman say the same thing.
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.940]   They say, "Well, before that point in time, before age 60, the numbers are it's just too
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.300]   expensive but it becomes a good deal after age 60."
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.620]   Is that more or less what your impression would be?
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:36.940]   >> My impression was that most people don't need it until -- very little people need it
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.980]   at age 55 or lower.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.820]   So age 60 is when he recommends that you look into buying it.
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:43.820]   >> Okay.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.820]   >> Actually, he does say buy it then.
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.380]   He does say you buy it when you're 60.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:50.260]   >> So that can be fine and I'll accept that.
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.260]   That's fine.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:55.540]   But to me, this really bothered me because I'm an ethical person.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:58.900]   I'm a man of integrity and I want to do the right thing for people.
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.220]   So I'm like, "Well, how should I do this?"
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.420]   So I started researching it.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:06.780]   I cannot find a single reason why age 60 would make any difference in a long-term care insurance
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:10.080]   need versus anything else and here's why.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:17.220]   If you buy insurance at age 55, the fundamental way insurance works is it is actuarially counted
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:20.960]   to cover the risk at every specific age.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.700]   So if you buy long-term care insurance at the age of 50, it is dramatically cheaper
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.940]   than it is at the age of 60.
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.020]   If you buy it at 30, it's dramatically cheaper than 60.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:30.580]   If you buy it at 72, it's more expensive.
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:34.220]   And I'm sitting here and saying, "Well, are Dave Ramsey and Suzy Orman more intelligent
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.580]   than the actuaries that have carefully calculated the risk?"
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:44.380]   I will tell you that long-term care insurance is perfectly priced at every single age.
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:48.460]   I own long-term care insurance and I'm 29 years old and it is perfectly priced for the
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:50.200]   risk for a 29-year-old.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:55.020]   And there is no statistical difference in risk that's dramatic between age 59 and age
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:56.020]   60.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.020]   Why not 59?
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.020]   Why not 58?
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:58:59.740]   Well, the reason is you have to just pick a number.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.940]   But what happens is it's complicated to explain how you actually need long-term care insurance.
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.940]   Here's my explanation.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:08.380]   It's actually not that complicated, but here's my answer if you say, "Well, if not at age
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.580]   60, then when?"
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:14.540]   You buy long-term care insurance when you have accumulated enough of a portfolio that
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:19.220]   that portfolio is then needing to be protected from the risk of the cost of a long-term care
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.220]   event.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.780]   Now, that sounds nebulous if you don't understand what that means, but that's the answer.
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.820]   So once you are on track to accumulate enough assets that you would then need to protect
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:32.620]   from the risk of needing a long-term care event, and if your income and your expenses
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.340]   cannot handle the cost of long-term care, then you insure for it.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:39.900]   Now, I don't care whether that's at 40 or whether that's at 65 or whether that's at
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.900]   70.
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:44.300]   If I were working with a client who is 65 years old and they don't have enough assets
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:48.460]   for retirement, there is not a chance in the world that they should buy long-term care
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:52.340]   insurance regardless of their age because they need to develop assets.
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.460]   They can't afford it.
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:57.640]   And if I'm working with a client who is 40 who has substantial assets enough that they're
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:02.460]   on track for retirement, and we're doing a risk analysis of the risk of long-term care
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.500]   -- if they can afford it and they need it, they should buy it.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.340]   So it's not that complicated, but that's how a financial planner thinks about it.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.140]   What happens, though, is you get this sound bite.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.420]   And I've had Dave Ramsey fans sitting in my office, "I'm going to buy long-term care
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.420]   insurance at the age of 60."
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   Why?
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.980]   What's magical about 60?
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.020]   And so I would say, "Well, let's actually run an analysis on your situation."
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.020]   "No, no, no.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.020]   Dave says 60.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.740]   Everything before that is the insurance agent trying to rip you off.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.740]   Everything after that is..."
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.860]   I'm like, "So that would be another good example."
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:33.020]   Analysis is something where if you go a little deeper, you get an answer that makes a lot
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:37.820]   more sense than a sound bite, which is that I recognize -- and with this, I'll wrap up
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:41.540]   my thoughts unless you have other questions, because I don't want to destroy your audience
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.140]   by going on for a two-hour show like mine.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.380]   But hopefully this makes sense.
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.080]   And I would just say that I want people to learn.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.260]   And I would still probably say to many people -- and this is where I've come -- I stopped
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:01:01.100]   giving his books away, because I learned that it wasn't effective for me to do that.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:05.280]   And I couldn't find anybody who actually followed through on his plan.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.140]   Like I said, ask the people who say, "I'm following the Dave Ramsey plan.
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:10.700]   How many credit cards do you have?"
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:13.380]   And I was always the one that didn't have a credit card.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.380]   And yet they all did.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.260]   "Well, Dave Ramsey says there are snakes."
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.260]   Okay, fine.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.780]   So I learned that people weren't following.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:20.780]   It's on one of them.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.220]   As far as that book, if someone is struggling with debt, I still don't have a better
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.220]   option.
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.660]   Maybe someday I'll gain the skill to be able to write the book that I wish existed.
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.380]   But I don't have a better option for them yet.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.160]   It's still an amazing book.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:39.000]   And I think that Dave has helped tens of millions of people just think and become more conscious
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   about their money.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.140]   I really do.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.980]   And I have a world of respect for him, because he's accomplished a lot of good.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:51.780]   I just think he could do so much more good if he weren't so intent on building his brand
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:54.020]   and differentiating it from everyone else.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.020]   And you can see that.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:59.740]   Go back and look at the Twitter exchange that he had with the financial advisory community.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:04.180]   And to me, that illustrates how he perceives what he's doing.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:08.220]   He perceives, evidently, I don't know, I'd like to meet him someday, and if he invites
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:12.300]   me to dinner, which I doubt would happen, I would love, I would be thrilled to go and
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.300]   talk to him.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:16.460]   Because there's, again, there's a big difference between seeing someone's public persona and
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.580]   what you do and say publicly versus who you are as a person.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:24.740]   But I think he could be so much more effective if instead of trying to divide between the
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:31.460]   general public and his show, if we could all get together, and this is my burden, if we
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.340]   could all work together, and it sounds so airy-fairy, but it's true, if we could all
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.980]   work together and recognize that we each are interested in different things, then we could
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.940]   make a tremendous amount of progress.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.340]   And the problem, we are not each other's enemies.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:50.020]   The financial advisor and the financial blogger and Dave Ramsey and Jim Cramer, we're not
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.020]   each other's enemies.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.300]   The enemy is financial ignorance.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.260]   And the enemy is financial illiteracy.
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:01.140]   And we have huge problems in our world.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:07.020]   And I just say, look at the $222 trillion of debt that the U.S. government has, including
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:12.620]   $17 trillion of existing debt and the remaining balance unfunded liabilities.
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.740]   That is not a problem of politicians.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.180]   Politicians perfectly reflect the culture.
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.100]   That is a reflection on the American culture.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:25.780]   And I just, maybe I'm idealistic, but I just think that we can work together instead of
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:32.940]   dividing and then we will conquer the financial illiteracy and the financial ignorance and
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:38.100]   will help people to find and achieve the lifestyles that they want to achieve if we work together
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.480]   instead of fighting all the time.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.340]   So that would be my thought.
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.340]   All right.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.300]   Will you allow me to wrap this up then?
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:50.260]   Because I think, okay, we're coming from you as a Dave Ramsey fan, just saying up to the
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.700]   end of debt point, maybe I'll make a generalized statement.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.660]   Hold on a second.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:02.380]   Yeah, we're right at the one minute mark, or one hour mark.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:06.260]   You as a Dave Ramsey fan, just when it gets to the investing, it needs to be more complex.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.580]   So not a Dave hater.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.220]   We're not saying that.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.620]   And me as a Dave Ramsey fan, we'll just say a Dave lover.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:20.380]   We're both saying the same thing here as far as it's the perception of the consumer, to
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:22.980]   use these two words, Dave says.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.460]   That's the dangerous part because I don't want to say they're blindly following.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:30.340]   I'm saying they're only following the sound bites, the one advice.
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:33.080]   So that is, I think we're on the same track here.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.420]   We're all trying to educate the consumer to learn for themselves, to know that there's
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:43.900]   different situations for each person, that there may be some adjustments to their financial
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.940]   plan, whether it's the seven baby steps or Susie Orman's build your FICO score plan,
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:49.940]   whatever.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.100]   That it's the danger of ignorance.
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.100]   You said that earlier.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.100]   No, I agree.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.340]   And I agree.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:05.540]   And it's very challenging because, again, you're walking a tightrope.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:13.820]   And I guess my summary would be is that it took me a long time and I think I'm still
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:20.020]   in many ways recovering from the dogma and the cult of personality that is so easy to
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.020]   want to build.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:26.820]   And I'll tell you what I see as a difference is I think that, see, five years ago, he was
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.620]   the only option as far as for me.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.540]   Where I think we're going to have a dramatic transformation, which I'm so excited about,
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.300]   is the financial blogging and podcasting community.
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:41.380]   Because now there are dozens and dozens of new financial shows.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.740]   And a few years from now, there will be hundreds and hundreds of new financial shows.
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:50.140]   And that competition and that ability to more easily access a broader voice, I think is
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.260]   going to make a major difference as far as helping people to be educated.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:57.860]   The audio resources for people to be educated have not existed.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.420]   You've had to go and read books.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.180]   And the average American simply doesn't read.
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:09.300]   And so that is a reflection on our, we're an ignorant culture in general because we
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.580]   don't read.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:14.140]   And so we're easily led, we're easily attracted to personality.
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.020]   So the good thing is, the cool thing is, again, I'm inspired by Dave.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:22.720]   That's why I started my show, is I want to provide the option for people who are ready
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.980]   to maybe go a little deeper, go a little farther.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.540]   And I admire him for what he has done.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:35.380]   And all of my comments are just that I think he could be more effective if he, I think
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.580]   he could be more effective.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.740]   And that's my hope.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.300]   Because we're not enemies.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.540]   We need the education.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.620]   We need to build financial literacy.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:49.140]   So I hope that I have done an effective job at, you know, the problem is financial advisors
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.100]   can't talk in public.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:56.060]   They're restricted behind the rules of the SEC and the financial industry.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:57.140]   So they can't do it.
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:01.660]   So hopefully I have done an effective job speaking for, you know, the financial advice
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:10.140]   community just to say in a caring way that we do have some concerns because I have faced
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.140]   the clients.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.540]   I faced the client who Dave said, "Buy a 10-year term," and guess what?
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.540]   You're uninsurable.
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.540]   That wasn't a good plan.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.380]   You can't get any more life insurance.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:19.380]   And that is heartbreaking.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.840]   And I faced the clients who are in and out of debt, in and out of debt.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:30.700]   And so I just wish that I think together we can grow and we can make a massive improvement
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:31.700]   in our culture.
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.820]   And I am entirely optimistic about that happening.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:38.900]   And I'm so thrilled that you have your show because you can speak to an audience that
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.380]   Dave won't appeal to.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.260]   And I have my show because I'm going to speak to an audience that Dave won't appeal to.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.900]   And even just here at FinCon, there are dozens of people.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.260]   And I think all of us, our lives have been touched by Dave.
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:57.320]   We owe him a great debt of gratitude because he has paved the way and tutored many of us.
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:03.160]   And yet the hallmark of a great teacher is acknowledging, is wanting to see their students
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.040]   be more successful.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.600]   And that's what I love to see is I love to see people going a little bit beyond maybe
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.160]   the teacher that started with and going to a deeper level.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.880]   Joshua Sheets, RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880]   I'm spent.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   I'm done.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   I did an hour of show time.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.120]   It's been a wonderful, wonderful discussion.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.200]   And I thank my listeners for listening to this.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.080]   We're also going to put this out on Joshua's feed as well.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.320]   Joshua Sheets, thank you so much.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   Thank you.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.000]   And I would just ask one last thing.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.480]   I have tried very, I was very nervous about producing this show because I have good intentions
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.360]   and I do not want to be a Dave hater.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.560]   I would crave some feedback for those of you listening.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.320]   Either if what I've said has resonated or if you hate it, that's fine too.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.040]   Tell me or comment on my show or comment on Steve's show.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.160]   I would like to know and hopefully I've done a good job and I hope that my heart has come
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.020]   through and that this can be a helpful message.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:03.680]   If this has offended you because I have, if this has offended you because I've stepped
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.600]   on a sacred cow, I understand because I think that in years past I would have been there
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.480]   too and I wouldn't have wanted to listen.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.120]   It took a while.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.440]   So I'm not bothered by that, but I'd love to have any feedback and I hope that my heart
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.960]   came through in this and was helpful.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.560]   Thank you for the opportunity.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.000]   I appreciate it.
