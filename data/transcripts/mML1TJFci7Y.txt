[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.720]   I have found that spending time in silence in nature without anything to do, disallowing
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.700]   myself from doing things, no note-taking, no reading, et cetera, and spending, I have
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.780]   spent a number of extended fasts in nature, just like water only, by myself, no talking,
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.640]   no reading, no writing.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.580]   What's extended?
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.340]   Seven days, generally.
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.060]   Wow.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.660]   So you're camping in nature?
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.760]   Sure.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.520]   With just water?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.040]   Yep.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.420]   That's it.
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.000]   By myself.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.080]   And there are risks associated with that, right?
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.740]   You got to be careful, not stupid about it.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.160]   But that does a lot for me with some persistent benefits.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.700]   Are there some favorite places that you've gone into nature?
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.900]   It doesn't have to be too fast.
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.080]   Like, for instance, I'm a big fan of some of the national parks up in the Pacific Northwest
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.740]   because it's like being transported to a different planet.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.160]   Yosemite is obviously amazing, but any favorite spots where people won't go looking for you
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.820]   there, don't worry.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.500]   You live in Austin all the time.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.260]   That's right.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:15.800]   So I would say Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, spending time in mountains, around rivers, lakes,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.680]   I find very therapeutic and just gorgeous.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.620]   I do think we suffer from awe deficiency disorder, you know, a bit of ADD when we're trapped in
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.800]   the mundane for too long with too much distraction, with too many to-dos, with too many relationships.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.540]   And there's no space for awe there.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.760]   There isn't the room necessary.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.120]   Awe isn't, from my perspective, generally a quick hit that you get in the 30 seconds between
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.920]   using two apps.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.320]   There's more breathing room required for a genuine transcendent experience of awe.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.220]   So I try to, on a yearly basis, as one of my top priorities, block out these weeks of
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.200]   time in nature.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.420]   Last year was the first year I did that.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.180]   I went out to Colorado in August and just took daily hikes.
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.020]   I stayed in a hotel.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.060]   I'm not as beastie as you doing water fast.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.700]   I was eating every day, but it was spectacular.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.080]   One thing I noticed, and I'd like to know your process on, how do you handle going back into
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.520]   life?
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.360]   Great question.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.560]   You know, because those days were and are amazing, right?
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.240]   You know, detached and, you know, maybe one text message here or there in between hikes or
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.900]   something, and then you just really clued in.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.080]   Even the process of watching a show at night, like one felt so rich and like enough.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.000]   So I wasn't as aesthetic as you were and like really cleaned all the clutter.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.080]   But once you return to life, it's almost like getting, being awash in demands.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.000]   And I can see from a place of more equanimity how one could make better choices.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.220]   But how do you handle those transitions?
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.860]   The re-entry.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.720]   So before getting to the re-entry, I think it might make sense for me to talk about what
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.380]   comes before.
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.280]   So let's say it's like pre, during, post.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:13.980]   Part of the reason I do these one week or longer periods off the grid is because it forces me
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.580]   to put better systems in place.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.060]   So there's the benefit that you derive from, say, that week.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.840]   And I have three weeks coming up right after this interview where I'm going to be off the
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.000]   grid.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.440]   To set myself up for three weeks off the grid, I have a team.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.240]   I have the podcast.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.740]   I have a lot of things that are in motion at any given point in time.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.680]   If you disappear for, say, a two to four week period, generally you cannot let the whole
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.380]   house catch on fire, then come back and put it out effectively, which means you need to
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.460]   put some policies and rules and so on in place in advance.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.420]   And there's a carryover effect that has a host of benefits and makes things smoother for the
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.760]   re-entry.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.500]   So they're related.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.180]   Like the more you set up the pre, the easier the post is going to be.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.300]   And then you have this beautiful, expansive experience in nature, whatever it might be,
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.060]   whether you're making it a suffer fest like I do or at a hotel at night, either way, these
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.740]   things can work.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.560]   And nature in and of itself is super helpful.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.860]   I do think that a lot of the time we like to imagine because we're driven, smart, accomplished
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.700]   people that our problems are very complex.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.680]   And at the end of the day, it's like you just need some time in nature and a cold shower and
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.480]   some fucking macadamia nuts and you'll be fine.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.120]   You don't need to solve like all the existential dilemmas of humankind actually or fancy pharmaceuticals.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:47.640]   So you have this experience over this week and what I will do then is set at least a, let's
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:55.380]   call it integration period of two to three days where I will slowly edge back in to my previous
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.800]   routine.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.900]   I will not within 12 hours of getting back to so-called civilization have a day full of
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.580]   calls or meetings.
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.760]   I will not do that.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.060]   It's too much of a shock to the system.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.300]   And I think it robs you of a tail end of benefits, which would also be the case with say fast or
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.820]   ketogenic diet or any number of interventions.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.520]   You can squeeze out a long tail of benefits if you make a handful of changes.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.900]   For instance, after an extended fast, what if you started with a subcaloric ketogenic diet
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.700]   for a few days?
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.840]   You get to extend some of the benefits as opposed to going straight back to say a diet that includes
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.500]   a lot of carbohydrates.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.900]   Similarly, when you create more of a vacuum, more space for awe, insight, reflection, recovery,
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.960]   I think you're doing yourself a disservice if you jump from park into sixth gear.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.400]   And so I plan for that.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.800]   And it's a function of scheduling.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.160]   I also have a predictable weekly schedule.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.480]   So I tend to schedule podcast recordings on Mondays and Fridays.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:06.120]   In preparation for an extended trip, I will batch a lot of similar activities that we have,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.020]   say, a bunch of episodes in the bank that are pre-scheduled.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.280]   Everything is figured out in advance.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.440]   And over time, the more you take these breaks, the better your system has become and the more
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.620]   liberated you are from the day-to-day, which means when you get back, you also don't need
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.200]   to rush as much into hyperactivity.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.180]   And if you do, you know that that is more from a compulsivity than from a necessity.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.820]   While you're on these nature retreats, are you writing on a daily basis?
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.600]   Are you just thinking and allowing thoughts to enter and leave your system?
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.680]   Depends on the retreat.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:52.380]   So sometimes I'm writing, but writing, I think, can underscore for me a desire to be compulsively
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.840]   productive.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.460]   And I think that is inversely correlated to my happiness or sense of well-being a lot of
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.760]   the time.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.940]   So there are many areas in my life now.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.640]   So if you were to ask me, what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote the
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.660]   word for our body, I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.600]   where I can very deliberately de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.980]   Where can I de-optimize?
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.040]   Where can I stop measuring?
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.200]   Where can I stop reading books?
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.660]   Which areas can I ignore completely?
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.920]   What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time?
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:35.760]   Delete Twitter.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:42.100]   Stop reading about books in X related to, say, AI or whatever it might be.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.360]   Like, where can I de-optimize selectively to sort of optimize the whole?
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.980]   Does that make sense?
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.900]   Makes good sense.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.440]   And before we started recording, I gave you a book, which is a short collection of poetry
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.040]   by Halaliza Gafuri, which is called Gold.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.380]   It's a collection of Rumi poetry.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:08.500]   Reading poetry is an activity almost by definition, which is the antithesis of optimization.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.000]   So I've tried to also integrate more of those activities into my life.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.700]   And this relates to your question, because there are times when I will force myself to
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.880]   sit on my goddamn hands and not write, not read.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.320]   Just do the thing that is so uncomfortable sometimes, which is just sitting there with yourself.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:35.520]   It can be incredibly uncomfortable in part because of the fear that it could be comfortable, especially
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.880]   for proactive people with a strong, to use Paul Conti's words, generative drive.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.980]   No, you're going to, that's, you know, which is a good thing, I believe.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.720]   It's a good thing.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.020]   And it can be a good thing.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:57.280]   It can indicate really incredible adaptations.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.880]   It can also sometimes, I think, indicate maladaptations, right?
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.800]   And so I think it's helpful to take a break from that generative drive, or at least just put
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:18.980]   it in park position to see if that generative drive is, is perhaps indicative of you leaning
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:27.700]   towards something in a healthy, proactive way versus running from something in a long-term
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.540]   destructive way.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.740]   Well, and I think Paul would say that part of the generative drive process is peace, you
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.400]   know, not as necessarily even as a still state, but as a, you know, being able to experience
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.680]   peace even in the transitions.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.640]   And there's a lot more to say about that.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.420]   And he would say it far better than I ever would.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.460]   So I'll leave it at that.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.400]   And I mean, for people who have the option, getting in nature, it doesn't have to be all
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.540]   day, every day on a water fast.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.700]   I just take certain things to an extreme because that's who I am.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.100]   Sorry, when you say water fast, that means fasting with water, right?
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.020]   Fasting, but yes, drinking water.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.160]   It just means you're allowed to have water and nothing else.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.120]   For, for a long time, I thought it meant that you're not drinking water.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.540]   Oh yeah, no, don't do that.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.900]   Some people do that, right?
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.740]   They do these crazy food, water fasts as a way.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.740]   I think they believe it clears senescent cells or something, but probably clears a lot more
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.840]   than just senescent cells.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.520]   Yeah, there might be something to it.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.920]   I mean, look, there are people who recycle by drinking their own urine, not my jam.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.860]   But I would say it's like three hours without shelter, three days without water, three weeks
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.560]   without food, general rule of thumb.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.400]   So be careful with dehydration.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.260]   You can go a long time without food.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.160]   I don't care how ripped you are.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.280]   You got 8% body fat, man, you got plenty of time.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.200]   You can go a couple of weeks, no problem.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.120]   Yeah, you got calories.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.280]   9,000 calories per pound stored body fat.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.940]   You got plenty.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.480]   Don't worry.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:59.900]   So for people who have the option to be in nature and just exercise several hours a day
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.700]   to exhaustion, see how many of your problems seem to just go away.
