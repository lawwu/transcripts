[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.460]   - I think everyone should have a part-time
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.300]   personal assistant.
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.260]   And that's an absolutely life-changing productivity hack.
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.220]   - So I do not have one, and I've struggled in the past.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.140]   And like five years ago, I tried.
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.340]   What kinds of things do you have this person do?
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.020]   And do you ever get too caught up in,
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.400]   I wanna make sure that they're doing them
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400]   the exact way I would do them,
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.280]   and then it ends up taking more time?
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.740]   - Basically, everything that I don't wanna do myself.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.740]   So a lot of emails, so my assistant, Dan, is remote,
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.860]   but he's based in the UK, so we've met in real life,
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.580]   which I think is really useful.
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.280]   A lot of people try and hire a VA in the Philippines
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.120]   for $5 an hour,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.840]   and then they're surprised when it doesn't work.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.620]   But if you have the ability to hire someone
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.840]   that you can potentially work with in real life
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.640]   some of the time, or at least meet in person,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.680]   it's just really nice.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.520]   But anyway, Dan basically goes through all my emails,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.060]   he deals with all my scheduling,
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.220]   things like scheduling this podcast, for example,
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.060]   I have basically outsourced the management of my calendar
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.400]   to Dan, so he deals with it.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   And it means that as emails come in and stuff,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.200]   I'm actually not the first person to see an email.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.940]   I'll see the superhuman notification on my phone,
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.740]   and if it's something really interesting or really urgent,
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.620]   then I'll reply to it there and then.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.380]   So yes, scheduling and emails is a big one.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.420]   But just beyond that,
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.700]   there's a lot of random admin tasks in life.
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.620]   Like for example,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.960]   I knew I wanted to get a cleaner for the house,
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.640]   kind of a bit of a first world problem.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.840]   But I don't want to be the one
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.680]   calling up random cleaning agencies in London
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.640]   and trying to find a cleaner
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.300]   who can be there at the same time that I want
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.100]   and do some of the ironing and change the sheets.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.020]   So I just said, "Hey, Dan,
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.980]   can you find me a cleaner for the house?"
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.600]   Basically, if they can come in on a weekday morning
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.520]   and do all the things including ironing, that's what I want.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.780]   And he was like, "Cool, I'll call around,
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.700]   I'll ring a few agencies."
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.820]   And he found someone and now we've got a cleaner.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.500]   Things like, I remember when I first got an assistant,
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.200]   I was just sort of like hanging around to be like,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.700]   "Huh, what are all the things I could delegate?"
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.540]   I was like, you know,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.160]   I wanted to learn how to play the ukulele.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.700]   I said, her name was Elizabeth at the time.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.500]   I said, "Hey, Elizabeth,
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.800]   can you find me a ukulele for under like 200 pounds
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.000]   and just find some reviews and just order it?"
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.340]   And she was like, "Cool."
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.060]   The next day, a ukulele arrived at my house.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.420]   And it's like, I'd been procrastinating
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.180]   from again, playing the ukulele for like two years,
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.020]   because all it would have taken was for me to sit down
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.560]   and spend five minutes searching on the internet
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.140]   for what's the best ukulele for a certain budget.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.620]   But it's in a way so much easier
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.980]   to be able to say that to an assistant
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.420]   or to a voice note that you can then send to an assistant.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.180]   Right now, Dan is hunting for a new property
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.020]   that we're moving into.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.240]   We're trying to move to studio spaces,
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.900]   ringing up estate agents and dealing with
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.500]   like booking viewings and arranging viewings.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.420]   Dan is doing all of that.
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.320]   And he's just getting them to send us WhatsApp videos
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.620]   so that I can spend my time doing things
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.460]   that I actually want to be doing,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.700]   like talking to you on this podcast
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.180]   or like making videos or like writing
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.700]   or things other than dealing with the hours
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.520]   and hours of admin it takes to book viewings
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.380]   for a property in a market where properties are moving fast.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.860]   So almost anything within reason
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.860]   can be outsourced to an assistant.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.740]   - Have you done a blog post or a video
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.980]   on how to use an assistant
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.300]   and all the tasks you could use for them?
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.740]   - No, we're working on it.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.780]   I have this course idea in my mind
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.820]   that we've sort of fleshed out.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.900]   It's gonna be called something like
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.180]   the life-changing magic of a personal assistant.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.340]   And I wanna make videos and blog posts and tweets
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.780]   and all of this stuff about it at some point soon.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.180]   - And for someone who hasn't gone down the path
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.600]   of how much this could cost,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.120]   like you mentioned, you could go to the Philippines,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.460]   it's super cheap, you don't need someone full-time, right?
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.920]   This is something you can kind of start
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.560]   at a pretty low cost and add a lot of scale.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.600]   - Yeah, I've been telling all my friends,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.800]   four hours a week will completely change your life.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   And if you can find someone for like,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.520]   someone local here in the UK, 15 pounds an hour.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.400]   So that's like $20 an hour for four hours.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.900]   That's like $80 a week.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.320]   And people are always like,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.640]   "Oh, that's like $320 a month.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.220]   "That's so expensive."
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.440]   And I ask, "Okay, this is not for students who are broke.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.020]   "It's for people who have real jobs."
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.780]   It's like, A, what's your actual hourly rate?
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.140]   Like you're doing the whole Naval thing
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.660]   of what is your actual hourly rate?
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.260]   Should you really be the one to do this thing
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.520]   that you don't wanna do?
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.060]   But also the other way of thinking of it is like,
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.500]   if you could free up four hours of your time to,
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.140]   for example, spend with your family,
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.100]   how much would that be worth to you over the long term?
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.900]   It's like, okay, probably worth more than $20, right?
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.040]   So now that it gives you an idea
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.760]   of how much it would potentially be worth
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.460]   hiring an assistant for.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.800]   I'm so bullish on the part-time personal assistant thing.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.120]   I think it's great.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.200]   - I got this email from someone this morning.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.280]   I'm gonna butcher the name, but Lee Aaron.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.720]   And they were like, "Hey, can you do an episode
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.560]   "on family life?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.740]   "I know you've talked about it a little,
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.120]   "but like, I have no time.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.020]   "Like, how do I maximize my time?"
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.200]   So this is a great example to Lee Aaron,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.920]   who wrote in something to consider to buy back some time.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.400]   And I'm a big fan of buying time.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.500]   Like, to the extent that you can find a person
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.460]   to do a thing that you don't wanna do,
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.520]   or not that you don't wanna do.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.000]   I used to love cooking.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.280]   And before kids, cooking was like in lieu
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.000]   of sitting on the couch doing nothing.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.320]   And that trade-off was good.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.640]   Now cooking might be in lieu of spending time with your kids
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.940]   or working or doing these other things
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.240]   'cause you just have less time.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.360]   And so, you know, it's not that I don't like it.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.120]   It's that I now have different priorities
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.960]   because there are more things on my plate.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.640]   And so whatever's at the bottom of that list,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.720]   I find that we often are doing those things,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.680]   even though we might not actually prioritize them
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.760]   because they have to happen.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.420]   But to the extent you can hire someone to cook or to clean
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.000]   or to do whatever task it is on your list,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.440]   it sounds like I need to test out one of these VA services
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.780]   or find someone.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.320]   I keep procrastinating.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   I keep procrastinating.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.300]   I gotta get something very clear
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.640]   of what I'm gonna do next and get it in motion.
