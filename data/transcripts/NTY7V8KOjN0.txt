[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   Welcome back to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.520]   Listener Brittany writes in to ask this, "Dear Pastor John, I currently live in Hungary and
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   am experiencing firsthand the current refugee crisis.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.000]   There has been so much talk and debating among Christians here about how we are to view the
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.800]   refugees and how we are to view this situation in light of the end times.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.760]   Everyone seems to think that this crisis is the end to Christian freedom in Europe because
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.040]   of the influx of Muslims and a sign of the end times.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.920]   Pastor John, do you see this situation as a start to the beginning of persecution for
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.260]   Christians in Europe?
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.000]   People think that because there will be many more Muslims, that Europe will become a Muslim
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.600]   continent.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.240]   What is your opinion on this?"
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.280]   I am reading at the moment Philip Jenkins' book, The Next Christendom.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.360]   It's about the massive changes, especially in the last hundred years, as the preponderance
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   of Christians has moved from the old established churches in the West, including Europe and
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.600]   the United States, to the global South of Asia, Africa, Latin America.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.240]   And part of this change is owing to the increased secularization of Europe and America.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.800]   Part of it is owing to the stunning vitality and spread of Christianity in the global South.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.440]   Part of it is owing to the drastic drop in birth rates in modern secular states compared
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.040]   to the comparatively huge population growth in the global South.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.320]   And more relevantly here, part of it is owing to immigration as millions of people move
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   around, move from North to South or global South into Europe and America to form problems
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.160]   or blessings.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.080]   And both are probably true.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.600]   And some of that is owing to crises like in Syria today and the present situation in Europe
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.060]   with the influx of immigrants.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.860]   This has been happening for a long time, this movement from what were formerly two-thirds
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:34.240]   world or Muslim world or pagan world or newly Christian global South into the formerly old,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.440]   large established Christian lands.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.100]   95% of the population of London is non-white British.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.540]   That statistic is kind of snuck up on the world, I think.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.740]   The biggest churches in London are gatherings of African and Caribbean worshippers.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.100]   Those immigrants who are flooding into America, into Europe, bring with them their own religion
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.880]   and customs and will inevitably shape the cultures into which they move.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.520]   If they're Christian, they may bring vitality and power of Christianity in a dying West,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.360]   but they may be viewed as a threat if they bring another religion like Islam to the heart
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.620]   of France or Germany or Hungary.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.580]   And yet, on the other hand, they may be the economic salvation of those very lands because
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.360]   the birth rates have so precipitously fallen that those lands cannot in the generations
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.760]   to come sustain the economic burden that the aging populations need support with.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.140]   And these lands are the most socialistic in the world except for the communistic countries
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.380]   that still remain.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.400]   And that creates an expectation of government provision and heavy taxation and there'll
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.900]   be nobody to tax if they don't have more workers and so there are positive sides to this influx
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.160]   as well as negative ones as they might see them.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.840]   So Brittany says, this is really her question, that she's talking to people and they're saying,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.700]   number one, this may be the end of Christian freedom in Europe if Muslims take over and
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.920]   establish Sharia law, presumably.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.520]   And number two, is this the sign of the end of the times, the end of history?
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.680]   And she wonders my opinion.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.200]   My opinion is, and it's a pretty strong opinion, it's a conviction, the present movement of
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.000]   peoples all over the world may, underline that word, result in the disestablishment
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   of Christianity from its prominent place in certain Western countries and may result in
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.040]   a sweeping predominance of Islam or even Sharia law and that this influx may not result in
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.920]   the diminishing of Christianity or the establishment of Islam but in fact may result in a massive
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.480]   spread of the Christian message among more and more peoples so that at the end of the
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.140]   21st century, Europe is the most authentically Christian that it has ever been.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.140]   That's my conviction.
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.680]   Both of those may happen.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.460]   So no, I don't have any sense of authority to pronounce that this is the end of Christianity
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.040]   in Europe or the beginning of a Islamic state.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   Who knows?
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   God knows.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.060]   And we should pray earnestly for the sweeping of the Christian gospel in power across all
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.040]   the peoples who are coming in and all those who have already forsaken it who live there.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.080]   Which is simply to say that I believe in the sovereignty of God.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.400]   Jesus said all authority in heaven and on earth, in Hungary and in France and in Germany
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.840]   and in Syria, all authority is mine.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   So go make disciples.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.620]   There is no historical circumstance that exists today that could possibly prevent a great
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:10.020]   Christian revival in Europe and a great spread of Christian preponderance if God in his sovereignty
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.820]   willed it to be so, and that's what we should pray.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:20.280]   And therefore, my opinion with regard to how the present situation relates to the end times
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.760]   is that we may be on the brink of a final—underline the word "may"—we may be on the brink
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.400]   of a final great outbreak of persecution that would lead to the completion of the Great
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.660]   Commission by the blood of the martyrs, the in-gathering of God's elect, the great conversion
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.680]   of the Jewish people, and the revelation of our Lord Jesus in the clouds to establish
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:54.200]   his kingdom on the earth that is fully possible in the next years because, again, God is sovereign.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.640]   It is not ours to know the times and the seasons.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.600]   It is ours to witness to the ends of the earth no matter the cost.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.400]   Here's what I think we can say with certainty regarding the end times, namely that we are
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.600]   in them now and have been in them since the coming of Christ because that's the way the
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:21.400]   New Testament talks, and it talks in this way about the persecution of the church in
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.400]   every age.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.600]   Let me read this passage from 1 Peter 4:12 because it is so pertinent to this question.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.560]   It says, verse 7 of chapter 4, "The end of all things is at hand."
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.760]   Okay, that's the end of the first century.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.840]   The end of all things is at hand.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.000]   "Therefore, be self-controlled, so reminded for the sake of your prayers."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.120]   Verse 12, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that comes upon you to
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.200]   test you as though something strange were happening to you.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.660]   This is what you expect when the end is at hand.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.720]   But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings that you may also rejoice and be
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.320]   glad when his glory is revealed.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.720]   If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the Spirit of glory
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.760]   and of God rest upon you.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.440]   "For," here it comes, "for it is time for judgment to begin with the household
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.760]   of God.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.040]   And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome of those who do not obey the gospel
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   of God?
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.880]   And if the righteous is scarcely saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?"
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:36.000]   So I think Brittany and the believers in Hungary and other European countries should press
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.720]   on with every possible means of spreading the gospel and displaying the justice and
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.360]   the mercy of Jesus and how they relate to their post-Christian culture on one hand and
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.600]   these ever-increasing Muslim neighbors on the other.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:09:00.560]   I think they should pray earnestly that God would turn this wave of immigration into a
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   great gospel advance in ways that no one perhaps can even imagine.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.000]   That's the kind of God that we have.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Amen.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.280]   Man, may this be true.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.000]   What a fascinating and faith-building perspective, Pastor John.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.920]   And thank you for the question, Brittany.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.000]   In this episode, Pastor John earlier mentioned a book, it's a book he commends, and it's
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.720]   titled The Next Christendom, the Coming of Global Christianity by Philip Jenkins.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.040]   Be sure to check that out.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.240]   Also in the news is Bernie Sanders.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.680]   And when Bernie Sanders is in the news, socialism is in the news.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.200]   And the listener wants to know how Christians should think about socialism, which is exactly
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   what we'll do tomorrow.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
