[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.700]   Happy Friday everyone,
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.520]   and happy birthday to you Pastor John,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.880]   and happy birthday to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.240]   Today the podcast turns six,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.880]   and Pastor John turns 73, milestones everywhere.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.680]   And today we're turning our attention to marriage.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.080]   We've been talking about Bible questions
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.500]   up until this point in the new year.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.680]   We transition now and turn our attention to marriage.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560]   It's a question from a listener named Emily
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.800]   that comes into us.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.280]   She writes this, "Hello Pastor John,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.800]   my husband and I have been married for almost seven years,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.400]   and we have small children.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.120]   We both love the Lord and have recently become convicted
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.760]   by how our marriage has fallen in our priorities,
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.160]   losing out to work, keeping up with the details of life,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.400]   and trying to muddle through parenting.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.320]   In the spirit of New Year's resolutions,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.480]   could you give us some practical advice and wisdom
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.360]   on how to keep our marriage
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.920]   the number one earthly relationship
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.760]   and restore it to its due place of prominence in our lives?"
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.320]   - Forgive me, Emily,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.600]   if I make things a little more complicated.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.480]   (both laughing)
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.120]   I love the question,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.680]   how do you restore marriage
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.960]   to its due place of prominence in our lives?
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.840]   I'm not quite as happy with the question,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   how do we keep our marriage the number one earthly,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.560]   and I know it's earthly, relationship.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.880]   He's not competing with God here,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.160]   the number one earthly relationship.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.360]   Is marriage the number one earthly relationship?
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.080]   What gives me pause about saying yes
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.480]   is that Jesus is clear that marriage
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.840]   is not going to be an eternal relationship, Matthew 22, 30,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.800]   "In the resurrection, they neither marry
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.400]   nor are given in marriage."
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.120]   While the family relationship among true believers
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.360]   is eternal, through faith in Christ,
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.800]   God makes us children of God,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.360]   and if children, then heirs,
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.400]   that never, ever comes to an end.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.320]   So relationship with fellow Christians
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.760]   as brothers and sisters is eternal.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.440]   Relationship with husband or wife is not eternal.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.720]   So is marriage the number one relationship?
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.360]   Now, I haven't answered the question yet.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.920]   I'm just saying here's some stuff to consider.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.400]   It's not an easy question.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   Consider this, in Titus 2, 3-5,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.960]   Paul says older women in the church,
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.320]   older women are to train the younger women
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   to love their husbands, et cetera.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.720]   So the relationship in the church
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.320]   of older women to younger women
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.000]   has a kind of primacy because the teaching
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.680]   is flowing from the Christian community
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.320]   toward the marriage relationship.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.240]   However, on the other hand,
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.400]   Paul says that the men in the church
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   who serve as elders must manage their own household well,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.520]   with all dignity, keeping their children submissive,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.400]   for if someone doesn't know how to manage his household,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.520]   how will he care for God's church?
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.520]   So here, the marriage seems to have a kind of primacy
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   because it becomes the measure of whether one is fit
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.960]   to lead in the church.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.400]   In other words, men learn how to love and lead at home,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   or you won't be fit to serve the wider family of God.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.480]   So is marriage and home the number one earthly relationship?
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.960]   My answer is yes and no.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.080]   Forgive me for making things complicated.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.480]   It depends on how you are measuring it,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   but however you measure, it is,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.840]   let's just agree with Emily here, massively important.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.520]   And Emily's second question is crucial,
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.280]   namely, how do you restore marriage to its due place,
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.200]   or how do you preserve its due place
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.080]   of prominence in our lives?
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.840]   That's what she's really asking.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.200]   She doesn't want me to mess it up with complications.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.880]   That's the right and good question.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   So let me give six brief bullet-like suggestions.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.960]   All of them probably should have a chapter behind them.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.520]   And I'm speaking to Emily here,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.680]   but not separate from her husband.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.000]   So push pause, go get your husband.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.840]   Like Jesus said, go get your husband.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.320]   If she becomes the leader in these things
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.360]   that I'm gonna say now, and he's just drug along,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.600]   that's not gonna work.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.040]   That's gonna unravel in the end.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.920]   Number one, embed your marriage in the church.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.800]   And I base that on everything I've just been saying
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.280]   for the last five minutes or so.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.920]   Don't rest until you have woven your marriage,
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.440]   your lives, into a wider family of mature saints
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   who wanna go hard after God with you
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.360]   and make each other's marriages all they can be for God.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.040]   Number two, read a few solid biblical books on marriage,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.560]   not fluffy ones with mere pop psychology.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.000]   And here's my suggestion, read them out loud together.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.880]   Sit on the couch and read them out loud together.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.220]   Take turns reading back and forth,
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.520]   or whoever reads best can just read it out loud.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.360]   Put the children to bed by 7.30.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.200]   If you're objecting, "Well, we got kids.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.320]   "Don't you know we got kids?"
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.040]   No, I do know you have kids.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.320]   It can be done.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.680]   Harold, hey, world, hey, young parents,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.240]   children can be put to bed at 7.30, and they will do it.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.080]   They will do it.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.900]   You can make them do it.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.840]   They'll get used to it.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.880]   Then you have two hours to do important things
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.280]   like sit on the couch and read
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.160]   and pray together about marriage, not wasted on television.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.160]   Number three, husband, take responsibility for all of this.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.200]   Now, taking responsibility doesn't mean doing
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.600]   all that needs to be done to make a marriage
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.680]   what it ought to be.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.960]   That's not gonna work.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.840]   Rather, taking responsibility means owning the challenge
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.760]   that when something is broken,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   your calling is not figuring out whether it's her fault.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.000]   Your calling is to overcome your frustration,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.040]   your self-pity, your anger, and your withdrawal,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.560]   and do all you can to move things forward.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.160]   And keep on doing this until one of you is dead.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.960]   You never get a pass on Christ-like burden bearing.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.520]   That's what headship is.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.600]   You never get a pass.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.320]   You never say, "I'm sick of this.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.500]   "There's no response to it.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.900]   "No way, no pass.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.960]   "One of you dies, then you're free."
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.220]   This is one of the hardest jobs in the world.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.840]   That's why God gave it to you, man.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.640]   Not because she can't do it.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.720]   Of course she can.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.440]   But because Christ-modeling men want to lift
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.840]   this burden for her.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.040]   Number four, husbands, plan a weekly date
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.800]   that is at least partly a state of the marriage conversation.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   Draw her out, find out what she's seeing and feeling
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.120]   about the state of the marriage.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.580]   Talk through steps to make things better,
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.140]   better schedule, better discipline of the kids,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.060]   better sex, better hospitality,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.540]   better financial stewardship.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.220]   Talk it through, bring it up.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.780]   Draw her out once a week, state of the marriage lunch.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.500]   Number five, Emily, wives, encourage him
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.260]   in every fruitful way in all the efforts
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.500]   of this kind of initiative taking.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   Find out what energizes his spiritual leadership
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.300]   and invest in it.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.120]   And finally, number six, pray together every day.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.260]   Not just the two of you at dinner with the kids,
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.880]   not just at meals or in a family relationship.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.880]   Here's the amazing summary of husbands and wives together
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.180]   according to Peter, 1 Peter 3, 7.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.180]   Husbands, live with your wives according to knowledge,
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.500]   showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.120]   since they are heirs with you of the grace of life
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.120]   so that your prayers may not be hindered.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.240]   God is the key to your marriage
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.400]   and its proper and due place of prominence.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.880]   Seek him together.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.120]   Amen, thank you for the counsel,
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.240]   biblical and seasoned with age, Pastor John.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.400]   And I hope you enjoy that large Butterfinger blister
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.280]   that you're gonna enjoy today.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.820]   And six years now, six years for the podcast now,
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.280]   we're entering our seventh year.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.560]   In that time, we've produced over 1,300 total episodes,
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.280]   including the very first episode
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.160]   which launched on John Piper's 67th birthday back in 2013.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.640]   Thanks for all your interests and questions
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.560]   over the past six years.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.040]   You can search all those episodes,
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.600]   you can read full transcripts and send us your own questions
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   all at our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.560]   Well, on Monday, a question about Calvinism comes up,
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.600]   specifically if Romans 9 speaks of the election
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.360]   of the saved in terms of being not of works.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.160]   Why do Calvinists so often speak of reprobation,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.860]   of non-believers based on sinful works?
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.360]   Why make election unconditional and conditional?
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.800]   That's on Monday, interesting question.
