[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980]   together. Well, a new study is showing the U.S. could drastically lower its number of
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.180]   coronavirus cases by simply wearing a mask. According to the data from UC Berkeley, if
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.820]   80 percent of us wore a facial covering in public, our COVID-19 infection rate would
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:23.060]   drop to about one-twelfth the number of cases. So why is it that only 14 states require it?
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   Joining us now is someone who's really striving to change that, co-founder of the Global Masks
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.560]   for All Movement, Jeremy Howard. Jeremy, thank you so much for being with us. Bring us up
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.200]   to speed on your efforts. Thanks so much for having me. So I'm one of
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.280]   the over 100 signatories to a letter that was released yesterday. It does talk about
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.920]   that research and other research. And the letter asks that all governors require masks
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.640]   in public. This is a really big step you mentioned earlier in the segment about the kind of relationship
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.760]   between Russia and the US. It's an important debate. But let me tell you what the scientists
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.080]   on this letter include. A Nobel Prize winning virologist, a Nobel Prize winning economist,
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.400]   the editor in chief of Nature, the world's top science journal, the editor in chief of
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.880]   the Lancet, the world's top medical journal. This is something which scientists consider
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.600]   so important that they are coming out publicly and saying the science says we have to do
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.680]   this if we're going to see these lockdowns and avoid a second wave, avoid the death count
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.880]   getting bigger and get the economy back up and running again.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.540]   But Jeremy, can I ask where do you live? So I'm in San Francisco. Well, I'm currently
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.680]   with my family in Houston, Texas. OK. Do you see a difference between those two places
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.880]   as far as how people react to wearing the mask? Oh, yes, absolutely. So both of those
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.880]   states do not require masks. Only 14 states require masks. But my hometown of San Francisco
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.800]   does, as does Houston. So there's a kind of a difference in between cities, between states.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.720]   What I've seen is there's a lot of kind of confusion, which is quite quite reasonable.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.920]   Let me ask you, is it a confusion or is it culture? Because I've lived in California
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   and I've lived in Texas. And I think in Texas you're going to have a hard time requiring
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.520]   the whole state to wear masks. It could be. I mean, we'll have to see. I think what we've
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.120]   seen happening, though, is when the death count goes up really high, like happened in
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.440]   New York, it wasn't until that people started saying, OK, we'll take this pill. So if winter
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.400]   comes and the death count shoots up in Texas, I think people might say, well, given a choice
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.880]   between my family dying and wearing a mask, maybe I should just wear the mask.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.040]   Is that what it's going to take? Because we're you know, we in the United States are kind
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:50.600]   of hardheaded. You know, I just can't be. Yes, we can be. So I can understand how all the
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.040]   data you have is probably absolutely true. And yet Americans, they don't like being told
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.000]   what to do. I get it. I really do. But look, you know, surely it's better than being locked
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.720]   up inside. You know, don't we want to get back to work? Here's the thing. Sometimes
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.120]   we accept some little infringements. For example, I don't want to go out and sit on a restaurant
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.960]   seat where the previous customer was not wearing pants. So we do have laws in this country
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   that say put on some pants before you go out. You have a great sense of humor, Jeremy. Wearing
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.040]   pants is much less, you know, not wearing pants is much less dangerous than not wearing
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.840]   a mask. If you don't wear a mask, you could kill the people around you. So please wear
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.960]   one. Sometimes, though, Jeremy, it takes almost a tragedy. It almost takes you being personally
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.860]   affected by it. Say, for example, my mother in law, unfortunately, I lost her to covid-19.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.600]   So for me, you know, there are times when I take a mask, I try to be responsible. But
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.480]   I think that I would have a little bit more of a feeling like, oh, this is something that
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.780]   I should do for myself and for others. But you know what? That mask isn't really protecting
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.200]   you that much, just a little bit. The main thing it's doing is protecting the people
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.360]   around you. So, you know, I have people in my family who have serious health risks. In
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.200]   fact, 80 percent of Americans, I think, are considered to have comorbidities, reasons
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   that they'll be more at risk. And the thing is, they're not safe unless all the people
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.440]   around them are wearing masks. So if we want the economy to really open up, getting rid
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.480]   of the lockdown won't be enough. We actually need people to feel safe. And that means people
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   need to wear masks.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.120]   Jeremy, thank you very much for joining us and having such an interesting conversation.
