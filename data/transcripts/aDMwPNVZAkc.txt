[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   Well, if you've done any study in the Gospel of John, I hope you immediately notice that
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.240]   there's a massive difference in the way John presents the concept of truth versus the synoptics.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.620]   Statistically, you can find that observation because John focuses on truth 55 times, whereas
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.080]   the synoptics cumulatively do so 17 times.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.960]   So even that statistic alone, 3 to 1 basically, gives you an insight that John is trying to
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.900]   accomplish something greater than what the synoptics are doing.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.400]   That is not to say that the synoptics are not trying to present an untruthful account
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.440]   about the story of Jesus.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.320]   Don't misinterpret me in that way.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120]   They are presenting a truthful account, yet John uniquely, according to scholars, presents
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.880]   it theologically, whereas the truth statements in the synoptics are more factual statements.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.960]   Yes, this statement is true.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.840]   Whereas with John, it's a theologically rich presentation.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.760]   You can also look at the weight and the value of truth in John beyond statistics.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.920]   I messed up on the numbers, let me say it correctly, 55 times versus 18 times.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.240]   Let me just correct myself, 55 in John, 18 in the synoptics.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.880]   But there's a second way you can identify that John is trying to feature truth, and
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.560]   that is through the I Am statements.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.840]   You know, we have seven of them.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   They become valuable and important to the structure and tapestry of John.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.440]   Well, one of them is John 14 6, "I am the way and the truth and the life."
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.920]   So putting that concept into the I Am statement elevates it in its importance and value in
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.640]   the Gospel of John.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.360]   You can see it even appear in some of the strategic narratives, whether it's the introduction
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.880]   of the light for the very first time in the beginning, verse 9 of chapter 1, talks about
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.960]   the light and the truth that comes through that light.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.240]   John the Baptist, of course, is going to be introduced as the witness, as the first witness
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.240]   to the light.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.840]   But then the story of Nicodemus, truth is at the core of it, regeneration and the focus
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.360]   of what it takes to actually enter the kingdom of God and be in the kingdom of God.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.520]   And Jesus is leaning on the Old Testament to help John understand that.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.160]   Or the story of the Samaritan woman, again, a very unique story, not repeated in the synoptic
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.360]   Gospels, but truth becomes the core of the worship discussion in verses 23 to 25.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.240]   Or the story in chapter 8, the Abraham dialogue, and the narrative surrounding that is focused
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   on truth.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.720]   That is the most concentrated passage in the Gospel of John on truth, John chapter 8.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.320]   Or you can go into the Upper Room discourse, chapters 14, 13 through 17, again, truth is
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.520]   at the core of that discussion, we'll look at that in just a little bit.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.320]   John 17, one of the most precious and holy passages in Scripture, right, the holy ground
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.480]   of prayers.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.200]   And yet chapter 17, verse 3, immediately says, "This is eternal life, that they may know
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.840]   you, the only true God."
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.760]   So now he's introducing God the Father as the true God, multiple times, but chapter
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.080]   17 features that at the very beginning.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.160]   And of course, next to the last verse in the Gospel of John 21-24, multiple times repeats
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.280]   this idea that we are looking at a truthful presentation of the story of Jesus.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.600]   So Stanley Porter says this, "The Gospel indicates that truth originates in the tripartite
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.560]   relationship of the Father, Son, and Spirit, and it is realized in truthful relations between
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.400]   the Son and human beings."
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.880]   I want to develop that for us this afternoon, that for John, truth is triadic or trinitarian,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.680]   whichever tri-word you like to use.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.240]   So you've got statistics, you've got strategic locations where truth appears in the Gospel
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.280]   of John, you also have the purpose for Jesus' coming being tied to the truth.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.480]   There's only two places in John where Jesus speaks about why he came.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.780]   We know chapter 10, verse 10, "I've come that they may have life," right, and have it abundantly.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.640]   And then chapter 17, and some chapter 18 rather, when Jesus is speaking to Pilate in verse
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   37, he says, "I am a king, and for this reason I was born, and for this I have come into
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.920]   the world to testify to the truth.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.800]   Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice," and I'll link 10 and 18 in just a minute for
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.020]   us.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.960]   So you've got the presentation statistically, the strategic locations, and then you have
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:36.200]   this purpose for why Jesus came being tied to this idea of truthfulness, and as the deliverer,
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.760]   or as he's called by many, the revealer of the Father, the Father of truth.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.720]   But here's a link I want to make for us between chapter 10 and chapter 18 before we get into
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.280]   some of the specific outline that I want to present to you.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.960]   In both chapter 10, and you're going to have to use your Bible, so if you don't have one,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.400]   look it up on your phone please.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.820]   If you do, we're going to start flipping.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:05.280]   In chapter 10, Jesus is presented as the Good Shepherd, right?
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.360]   We know that as the Good Shepherd motif, and it's not just the Good Shepherd idea of Jesus
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.320]   giving compassion and care, and he'll give up his life voluntarily for his sheep.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.280]   That is at the core of the theology of this chapter, but you have to understand that Jesus
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.880]   is picking up a metaphor from the ancient world that was adopted by the monarchs and
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.840]   the pharaohs and the emperors, where the Good Shepherd was supposed to symbolize care and
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.480]   compassion, and it was used as a propaganda mechanism in the ancient world.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.620]   You have letters going back and forth between the Roman emperor and the pharaohs in Egypt
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.720]   where the emperor is encouraging the pharaohs to say, "Act like a shepherd to your people."
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.280]   Now we know what kind of shepherds they were.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.760]   They slaughtered them.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   There was no love or compassion or care or sacrifice.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.900]   Jesus shows up and says, "I'm a Good Shepherd.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.200]   I'm going to lay down my life for my sheep."
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.920]   He says that statement multiple times in chapter 10, as you know.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.000]   So undergirding this Good Shepherd motif in the ancient context, you have an understanding
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.880]   that Jesus isn't simply speaking as a shepherd who leads and provides and protects, but he's
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.280]   a shepherd who is a royal shepherd, because that was the understanding of that ancient
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   world.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.600]   You can see that in the Old Testament.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   David is a shepherd.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   He's a king.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   God is presented as a shepherd.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.880]   He's the King of Israel.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.960]   So you've got that even in the Old Testament scripture.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:33.560]   In John 18, if you take a look, in verse 33, as Jesus and Pilate are conversing, they're
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.280]   in the Praetorium, and then Pilate says, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:47.180]   So the conversation begins focusing on the royal title or the royal status of Jesus.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.680]   And Jesus, of course, asks, "Who's telling you these things?"
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.960]   And Pilate says, "I'm not a Jew."
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.320]   Verse 36, "My kingdom is not of this world," is what Jesus responds.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.040]   "If my kingdom was of this world, then my servants would be fighting so that I would
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.240]   not be handed over to the Jews.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.200]   But as it is, my kingdom is not of this world."
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.920]   And then the famous statement in verse 37, "So you are a king?"
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.400]   And then Jesus says, "Yes, I am a king."
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.560]   And then this is the reason I was born.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.320]   In all four Gospels, that question is asked, and in all four Gospels, Jesus affirmatively
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.200]   responds, "Yes, I am a king."
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.840]   We know the differences in the details between the Passion narrative in each Gospel, the
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.280]   Resurrection narrative, but this is consistent.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.760]   In other words, every Gospel writer is trying to present Jesus as the king, but in the Gospel
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.200]   of John, it becomes front and center.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.440]   Ten references in chapter 18 and 19 in the Passion narrative and the Resurrection narrative
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.400]   focus on Jesus as the king and the kingdom that he represents.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.160]   So now you have to elevate this whole discussion beyond simple truth or beyond the crucifixion
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.700]   and this, you know, unfair trial.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:53.800]   You have to say, at the core of the discussion is Jesus as the king who is bringing truth
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.120]   into this world.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.760]   Which now, in verse 36, when he says, "My kingdom is not of this world," we're not talking
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.840]   about what Andrew Lincoln, for example, says, "the cosmic battle."
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.240]   So now Jesus is trying to create a scene in the mind of Pilate that, "I am a king."
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   That's a true statement.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.520]   I was born for that.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:23.440]   However, we're talking about a cosmic conflict, and at the core of it is the identity of Jesus.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.000]   It's God versus the world in that sense, and you can see this develop as you keep looking
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.280]   into chapter 18 and chapter 19.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.120]   So the conversation continues, Pilate sarcastically says in verse 38, "What is truth?"
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.760]   In verse 4 of chapter 19, he brings Jesus out.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.680]   He says, "I don't have any, I can't find any guilt in him."
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.800]   In verse 5, he says, "Behold the man."
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   They respond.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.300]   In verse 6, "Crucify him, crucify him."
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.480]   He says, "Take him yourselves and crucify him."
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.400]   Verse 7, "We have a law.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.720]   We don't have the right to crucify him because he makes himself out to be the son of God."
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.240]   So now you have another indication, and there is something supernatural taking place.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.640]   It's not just the kingdom of this world.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   Verse 8 says Pilate is even more afraid.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.320]   Coming back to Jesus in verse 9, he's trying to figure out his identity, his origin.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   Where are you from?
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.040]   Jesus doesn't answer him.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.840]   And then, Pilate says in verse 10, "You don't speak to me."
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.520]   And the way it's in the Greek, if you have that in front of you, or if you've studied
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.760]   this before, it's extremely emphatic.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   "To me?"
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.440]   Do you know who I am?
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.640]   I'm the governor of Judea.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.960]   I'm here on the authority of the emperor.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   And it was.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.800]   Judea was an imperial province, which had protection, and uniqueness, and elevation.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.140]   And so there was a direct relationship between the emperor and the governor of Judea, unlike
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.400]   other Roman provinces, the other 12.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.800]   And so Pilate is shocked, and disturbed, and annoyed, I would say, that Jesus refuses to
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.880]   answer his question.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.560]   Verse 11 says it, or verse 10 says, "Do you not know that I have the authority to release
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.400]   you, and I have the authority to crucify you?"
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.680]   Twice he says, "I have authority over you.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.480]   How dare you not speak back to me and answer my question?"
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.320]   And Jesus continues this cosmic battle motif in verse 11 and says, "You would have no authority
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   over me."
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.880]   Unfortunately, the translators did not say none at all.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.360]   That is in the original.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.560]   Twice Pilate demands and conveys that, "I have authority over you."
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:43.080]   And twice Jesus says, "You would have no authority over me, none at all, unless it came from
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.660]   above."
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.520]   So now Jesus elevates this.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.780]   We're talking about authority at the gubernatorial level.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.460]   We're talking about something different here.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.760]   So verse 12 says, "Pilate made efforts," and actually this is an imperfect meaning, "He
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.680]   needed to figure out a way," just kept thinking about a way, "to release him."
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.400]   And the Jews are crying out, "If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar."
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.240]   So now they're elevating this to the next level of authority.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.840]   You've got the governor, let's take it up a notch to the imperial level of authority.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.840]   They're trying to bring as much as possible to pressure him, Pilate that is, to crucify
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840]   Jesus.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.520]   But what I think we need to be seeing is that Jesus goes back and says, "My kingdom is not
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.820]   of this world.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.560]   My authority is greater than your authority."
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.280]   Fine, elevate it, go from the governor level, go to the imperial level, my authority is
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.040]   greater than that even.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.400]   So here we are talking about a conflict, a cosmic conflict of two kingdoms.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:49.020]   If you remember the Gethsemane back in chapter 18, you remember what happened.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.260]   Look at verse 4 of chapter 18.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:58.500]   So you have the Roman soldiers, you have the Jewish officers, a cohort, about 100 men showing
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.920]   up, chief priests and Pharisees and all that.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   And so they're coming to arrest him and Jesus asks, "Who do you seek?"
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.440]   And they answer in verse 5, "Jesus of Nazarene," and he says, "I am."
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.880]   And they fell down to the ground in verse 6.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.160]   You would assume that Jesus is the victim here, right?
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.120]   They're ready for a brouhaha.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.660]   They brought as many soldiers as they could to contain this villain.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.000]   And yet, he's got full control of the situation.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.160]   Because back in chapter 10, we already knew that.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.820]   He's going to lay down his life on his own initiative.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.560]   No one will take it away from him.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.800]   In chapter 2, there was an attempt at a premature glorification.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.460]   And he says, "The hour hasn't come."
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.080]   In chapter 7, his brothers say, "Well, if you are the Messiah, go and reveal yourself
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.020]   publicly at the Festival of Booths."
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.980]   And he says, "This isn't the time yet.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.980]   The hour hasn't come."
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.900]   That phrase repeats itself eight times in the Gospel of John.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.020]   In other words, Jesus is moving in his own timeline.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.660]   Not his brothers, not his mother, not his disciples a little bit later, not Pilate,
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.340]   not Judas in chapter 18.
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.820]   No one will prematurely move him towards the disclosing of the truth and the presentation
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.540]   of the kingdom of God.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.380]   And so here, Jesus is presented as the one in control.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:23.540]   Whether Pilate knew how this whole thing went down and back in Gethsemane or not, is irrelevant
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.700]   to the presentation of Jesus in chapter 19 that he is in charge.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.940]   And he's going to say, "This is how this is going to go down.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:39.020]   And I'm a king and you would have no authority over me, none at all, unless someone above
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.220]   you gave it to you."
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:48.740]   We need to see that because at the core of this conversation is truth.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.620]   One author said it this way, "There's a clash of two kingdoms, the kingdom of God and the
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.620]   kingdom of darkness."
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.740]   And you remember Luke 22 verse 53 when Jesus says, "This is the hour and the authority,"
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.420]   the same terminology is being used.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:09.300]   The authority that Pilate is claiming in John 19 is actually being referred to in Luke 22.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.140]   This is the hour and the authority of darkness.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.820]   So yes, there's this conflict that is presented in John 18 and 19 as Jesus, the representer
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:25.140]   of the kingdom of God, versus Pilate, the representer of the kingdom of darkness.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.980]   Why this cosmic conflict?
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.140]   Go back to 1836 and 37.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:37.260]   "My kingdom is not of this world, but I was born to testify to the truth."
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:45.040]   That's why he doesn't owe an explanation to anyone as we saw in verse 9.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.400]   This is the last time Jesus will speak about truth in verse 37.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.680]   The conversation is over regarding truth and the answer that Jesus gives, you could imagine
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   echoing in Pilate's chambers and the final words are, "What is truth?"
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.080]   And John answers that question from the very beginning.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.440]   So as you kind of develop the narrative and the literary motif and the style and the content,
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.640]   the way John develops his gospel, you have to admit that that question being posed by
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.960]   Pilate, the greatest of authorities, human authorities in the gospel, John aims to answer,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.040]   "I'm going to tell you what truth is.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.540]   I'm going to refer to it 55 times.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.820]   I'm going to make sure you understand that by the time the gospel is over, you're going
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:37.520]   to agree with me in 21-24, this is the disciple who's testifying to these things and he wrote
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.960]   these things and we know that his testimony is true."
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:49.680]   And in 1935, "He who has seen has testified and his testimony is true and he knows that
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.600]   he's telling you the truth so you would believe."
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.640]   So whether it's in reference to the most important event in the gospel of John, the crucifixion
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:03.200]   and thereby salvation has come, or the very ending of the gospel of John, he wants you
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.560]   to walk away and say, "What I just read is truth, thoroughly true.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.680]   There is no doubt that this is the true presentation of the story of Jesus."
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.720]   And Jesus' words to Pilate before Pilate sarcastically says what is true, in verse 37, the very last
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.600]   sentence, "Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.920]   So now you've got this supernatural presentation, something has to happen before you can actually
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.720]   hear my voice and understand that I'm telling you the truth.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.200]   That's the link back to chapter 10 that I was trying to make.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.940]   There's this royal link that we can make between 10 and 18-19, but there's also this connection
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.500]   with the phrase, "You will hear my voice."
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:54.160]   In verse 3 of chapter 10, Jesus says, "The sheep hear my voice."
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.560]   In verse 4, he goes ahead of them and they follow him because they know his voice.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.240]   Verse 16, "I have other sheep," referring to the Gentiles, "that are not of this fold.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.840]   I must bring them also and they will hear my voice and they'll become one flock with
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.440]   one shepherd."
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.560]   And then of course the most famous is verses 27-28, "My sheep hear my voice.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.560]   I know them.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   They follow me.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   I give them eternal life.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560]   They'll never perish.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.280]   No one will ever snatch them out of my father's head."
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:30.160]   So the sheep hearing the voice of the shepherd or the one who is speaking in chapter 18-19,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:39.320]   that is the link that we should make, that the truth resides in Christ, but it is received
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.800]   by those who can actually hear his voice and of course going back to chapter 3, you can
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:50.100]   link it back to the regeneration that we all experience.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:56.480]   So what John is trying to do is to say there is this objective truth, that's chapter 18
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:02.280]   verse 37, propositional truth that we have to connect with and understand and we'll develop
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:08.320]   that in a little bit, but there's also this subjectivity to this truth, this incarnational
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.700]   truth that is in John 14-6, "I am the truth."
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.740]   That's unique to John.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.620]   You won't find that in the synoptics.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:21.300]   So John is thoroughly theological in his presentation of truth.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:26.180]   He's moving away from the Greco-Roman presentation, the Hellenistic presentation where truth was
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.780]   a concept that is factual.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.620]   It's simply philosophical.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.580]   He says, "No, there's a different approach that we should understand truth and that is
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:44.720]   it's incarnational and for John it is also an instrument to get you to believe."
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.920]   That's the whole point of the gospel, we read that at the end, and believe of course appears
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.280]   multiple times in the gospel of John.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:58.200]   And so another scholar said this, "In John, truth involves a mode of behavior and relationships
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   toward God and within the new community."
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.480]   So there is a multifaceted presentation of truth.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.600]   It's propositional, it's objective, it's incarnational, but then it's also missional.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.640]   And I want us to think about truth in the gospel of John in that way.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:25.360]   Now, to understand it that way, we have to say that John is presenting truth in the person
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.960]   of Jesus Christ from the very beginning.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:34.260]   In John chapter 1, we know that the incarnation statement in verse 14, "The word became flesh
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.180]   and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory, glories of the only begotten from the father
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.280]   full of grace and truth."
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.580]   So from the very beginning of the introduction of the Logos, he's trying to make sure that
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.640]   you tie his coming to the presentation of truth.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:55.160]   In verse 17, he repeats something similar, "Grace and truth were realized through Jesus
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.620]   Christ."
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.640]   So for John, it is contained in the person of Christ.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.600]   Before we look at it through the various theological categories, I want to make sure we understand
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.240]   John's vocabulary surrounding truth.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:15.600]   He's got a very deep and rich and multi, you can say, synonyms regarding the presentation
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.600]   of truth.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.600]   So there's a little chart.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.840]   It's not the most beautiful chart you've ever seen, but it is a chart that I hope helps
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   you.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.080]   If you can skip over to Gnosko and Oida chart that gives you the columns.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   There we go.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.200]   I'm happy to send some of this information to you.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.960]   There's a discussion about whether Oida and Gnosko both meaning knowledge in the gospel
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.280]   of John are interchangeable, they're synonymous, they have different meanings.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:45.080]   I would say based on those categories, Jesus' common knowledge is discussed and both terms
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.200]   are used for that, or his supernatural knowledge, or people's common knowledge, or their understanding
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.840]   of truth, or people's lack of understanding of truth, or of Jesus, or the disciples' knowledge
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.280]   of truth, or the disciples' lack of understanding of truth, or the disciples' intimate knowledge,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.460]   or the mutual knowledge between the Father and the Son, both of those terms are used
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.460]   in those categories.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:11.000]   In other words, the best synthesis is to say those two terms that are typically, you know,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.900]   they appear all over the New Testament, are actually interchangeable in the gospel of
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.900]   John.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.660]   I'm not saying that extends to the rest of the New Testament, but when we study the New
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.000]   Testament, we should study it within the authorial context.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.800]   And then you can extrapolate and say, "Okay, what are the differences with other authors?"
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.400]   Give the author the freedom to use a term within the context of what he's trying to
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.100]   convey to you.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.380]   Knowledge could be the foundational meaning, but it could have nuances.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.900]   For John, it is interchangeable.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.520]   Those two terms are interchangeable.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.600]   But beyond that, if you look at the next slide, you can see John enriching this idea of how
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.840]   do I arrive at the truth?
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.200]   Well, it's through knowledge, and you can see multiple passages talking about knowledge
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   and truth.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:01.340]   Go back, go to the next slide, and you can see additional terms that John ties to this
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.200]   apprehension language.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.920]   How do I fully grasp who Jesus is?
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.720]   And you can see that list in front of you in the passages.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.000]   These are just a sample.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.280]   There's more passages connecting with that.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:22.320]   So all to say, John is extremely complex and rich in trying to get the reader to understand
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:30.520]   what truth is, and then how do I grasp this truth intellectually, and ultimately, personally,
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.760]   as he demands a response?
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:40.360]   So because John is so theological, I think it's good for us to look at six categories.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:46.560]   I see a kaleidoscope of John's presentation of truth through the lens of theology.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.720]   And let's begin with Christology.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.120]   Let's just look simply at the Christological presentation of John and truth, beginning
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.280]   with the purpose statement at the end of chapter 20.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.620]   There are many signs that could have been performed that are not in this book.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.640]   Verse 31 says, "But these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.880]   Christ or the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing, you will have life in his
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   name."
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.880]   So that's a simple purpose statement.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   Most of you probably have studied it or memorized it, or you know exactly how that fits into
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.720]   the entire gospel, whether it's a gospel of perseverance or a gospel of evangelism.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.920]   You can carry on that debate, as Fee and Carson have done for years.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.600]   I would say it's more perseverance-oriented, and I can defend that statement privately
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.720]   if necessary.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.320]   But I do think John is trying to convey something unique, and that is there's a Christological
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.800]   foundation to all that happens in the gospel of John, which takes us back to 114 that I
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   already read.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:52.880]   The Incarnation is the second member of the Trinity, the Eternal Son becoming a man taken
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:59.600]   on human flesh and delivering to us grace and truth.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.620]   Definitely this takes us back to Exodus 33 and 34, where Moses asked for God to reveal
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:12.560]   himself uniquely, and God's response is simple, "I'm going to let my attributes be displayed
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.560]   before you.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.560]   I'm going to speak."
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:21.640]   He does, and he says, "I'm a God," in verse 6 of chapter 34, "who is abundant in loving
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.200]   kindness and truth."
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:33.240]   So John quickly links us back to Exodus 33 and 34, and verse 17 reaffirms that link.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:42.220]   But he continues, and in chapter 7, John again refers to Jesus, and it says this, "He who
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.400]   speaks for himself seeks his own glory, but he who is seeking the glory of the one who
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:51.840]   sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him."
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.280]   In other words, he is true, thoroughly true, true and true and true, there is no unrighteousness
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.280]   in him.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:03.080]   So he'll repeat that idea of Jesus being the truth bringer or the one who contains truth
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.480]   in chapter 7.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.360]   Chapter 16, look at verse 7, where he again refers to the truthfulness of Jesus.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.920]   I tell you the truth.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.720]   It's your advantage that I go away.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.680]   It's a factual statement, believe me.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:21.000]   But again, Jesus is presented as the one who speaks the truth.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.520]   That's why in chapter 1, verse 9, he is the true light.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.840]   In 632, he is the true bread from heaven.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.120]   In 151, he is the true vine.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:36.040]   So all of those metaphors are intended to present Jesus as the one who is the true one,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:42.120]   but in all of them, he is symbolizing and representing the relationship between us and
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   God.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.640]   And you see that in multiple ways.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.240]   Of course, 14.6, "I am the way, the truth, and the life," meaning I'm the way, I'm the
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.400]   path, I'm the truth, I'm the means, and I'm the life, I'm the goal.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.740]   The path, the means, and the goal is probably the best explanation of 14.6, and you can
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.820]   find all the discussions about that in various commentaries.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:11.560]   So now, in John's mind, truth isn't simply, there's the word of God, believe it, Psalm
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.160]   119, Psalm 19, it's truthful, you should believe it and follow it.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:23.200]   No, the objective truth of who God is has now been contained and presented in a person.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:34.640]   And in chapter 8, that truth sets us free from sin.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.620]   Verse 32 of chapter 8, "You'll know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.960]   In verse 31, you see that if you continue in my word, so now there's an objective connection
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:49.300]   of this truth, my word, my teachings, then you are truly my disciples, and you will know
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.980]   the truth and the truth will set you free.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.540]   So now you've got both being presented here.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:58.140]   There's an objective understanding that's expected in 8.31, but there's a personal incarnational
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.380]   truth that you need to attach yourself to, to be set free from sin.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.880]   Now what happened earlier in 8.13 is the conversation begins.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.320]   Jesus declares, "I'm the light of the world."
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.200]   The Pharisees come back in verse 13 and says, "You're only testifying yourself, your testimony
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   is not true."
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.320]   In other words, give us a second witness.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.900]   Now back in 5.31, Jesus already said, "I agree with you, I need another witness."
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.160]   And so in 5.31, all the way down into the 40s, towards the end of the chapter, he says,
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.160]   "I'll give you four."
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.160]   Remember that section?
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.200]   "I'm going to give you multiple witnesses.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.360]   The Father's going to be my witness, John the Baptist is going to be my witness, the
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.320]   scriptures are going to be my witness as well."
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:43.240]   And I'm forgetting the fourth one, help me out here.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.040]   None of you know either, huh?
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.040]   The signs.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.800]   No, my works, not the signs, but synonymous.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.220]   So Jesus says, "I already said that, I get that, I've already given you multiple witnesses."
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:05.020]   So even the objection in 8.13 is gratuitous, even as the story develops.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.240]   But John's approach is to say, "Make sure you understand that this person of truth,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:16.520]   the Christology that is presented in the truth is a Christology of a person."
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.640]   So then, in verse 26 of chapter 8, Jesus says, "I have many things to speak and to judge
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.900]   concerning you, but he who sent me is true.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.480]   And the things which I heard from him, these things I speak to the world."
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:35.100]   So now he's the representer of truthful statements, and you can believe me when I present them
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.100]   to you.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.120]   Well, you know, the Jewish leaders quickly shift the conversation to origin, and in verse
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:46.900]   33, they start speaking about, "We belong to Abraham," Jesus says, "No, you really belong
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.600]   to the devil because you're trying to kill me because he's a liar, has been a liar, has
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.980]   been a destroyer," verse 44.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.560]   So now this discussion of truth is elevated to spiritual origins.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.740]   For them, it's physical, that's where it begins.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:07.600]   But Jesus takes it back to this cosmic battle that no, we're talking about a spiritual war.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:13.980]   But the climax of this whole section is in verse 36, where he already said there's a
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.260]   way to be set free from sin, verse 31, 32.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.340]   Verse 35, he says, "The slave doesn't remain in the house forever.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.200]   The son does remain forever.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.740]   So if the son makes you free, you'll be free indeed."
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:32.140]   So now there's a promise that whatever he communicated back in 31 and 32, if you continue
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.900]   in my word, you've got my disciples, you'll know the truth, the truth will set you free.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.480]   Verse 36, I'm the one who's setting you free.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:46.540]   And in the original, you've got a chiasm formed between verses 31 and 37, accenting the idea
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:54.000]   that if you want to be truly set free, the truthfulness and the perpetual reality of
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.860]   that freedom is contained in the person of the son.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.960]   So again, John is trying to look at it from multiple ways to say we're talking about the
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:09.500]   truth that is incarnate, that ultimately sets you free.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:15.220]   But it's based in his objective teaching back to verse 31.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:20.920]   My word is what you are expected to fulfill.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.640]   But in verse 31, there's a little nuance you should consider.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.920]   If you continue in my word, then you're truly my disciples.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:35.960]   So you have to have this abiding language as part of your understanding.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:43.420]   Menno, you've seen that word I'm sure before in John, unique to John, emphasizing this
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.880]   intimate, prolonged, or you can say eternal relationship.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:54.600]   And for him to strategically use a word that's often used to refer to the relationship between
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:00.720]   the father and the son, and then the believers and the son, and the believers and the spirit,
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.640]   to use it now in relation to the objective word of God, now speaks to the value we should
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:12.260]   place on that relationship with the objective truth of John 8, 31.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:20.560]   Now moving outside of John for a second, in 1 John 3, 19, John says we are of the truth.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.240]   So the application then, I believe John is written a year before 1 John is written, John
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.120]   just continues this discussion of truth into the epistles.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:36.800]   And he makes it so intimate to the true follower of Jesus that he uses language of being.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.240]   We are of the truth.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.600]   We're not standing in the truth.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.240]   We're not sitting in the truth.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.720]   We're not aware of the truth.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.160]   We're not practicing the truth.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.040]   No, we are of the truth.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.200]   It becomes part of our being.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:56.360]   That's the ultimate application, is that it has to be so intimate in your life that it's
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.920]   as if you embody yourself the truth of Jesus Christ, who he is.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   Obviously in a different sense.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.680]   I hope you understand that.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.720]   But that's what John is expecting of every single believer who wants to grasp his presentation
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   of what truth is.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.600]   That's a Christological presentation of truth in John.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.160]   There's also a second and that is in regards to theology proper.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.160]   That's a second category of theology in John in regards to truth.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.480]   And that is in reference to the Father.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.800]   And so in chapter 17, I've read this verse before, "This is eternal life that they may
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.420]   know you the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you've sent."
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:46.840]   So now John is tying truth to God's character, eternal life, Jesus Christ whom you've sent.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.420]   And of course, if you know John, you know how loaded that is.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.760]   Because they're always trying to define eternal life.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.700]   And in John, it has a very nuanced meaning.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.180]   Eternal life in John is not about living forever.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.140]   That's resurrection in John.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:07.040]   And he's 100% consistent in dividing those two.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.840]   Eternal life in John is about your relationship with God here and now that extends into eternity.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.920]   But it's not something you anticipate one day.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.420]   In the synoptics, it's different.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:22.260]   So be careful mixing those terms in the synoptics versus John.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:27.320]   But John nuances that because he wants us to understand there are phases in our relationship
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   with God.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.800]   And eternal life is simple, 17.3, to know the true God.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.120]   And of course, then Jesus Christ is the one who mediates that knowledge to us.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.320]   So that's John's connection of truth to the Father.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:51.160]   Now back in chapter 5, in that little paragraph regarding the four witnesses, verse 37 says,
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.200]   5.37, "The Father who sent me, he has testified of me.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.280]   You've neither heard his voice at any time, nor have you seen his form.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.240]   You do not have his word abiding in you, there's the man of language again, for you do not
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.320]   believe him who sent me.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.340]   You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life and they
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.920]   testify about me.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.440]   And yet you're unwilling to come to me so that you may have life if I do not receive
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:20.200]   glory for men, but I know that you do not have the love of God in yourselves."
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.760]   Who's going to accuse you before the Father, verse 45?
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.720]   The one who accuses you is Moses in whom you have set your hope.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.040]   If you believe Moses, you'd believe me, for he wrote on me.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.320]   If you don't believe his writings, how will you believe my words?
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:38.080]   So now John is trying to present this element of the Father is the one who testifies to
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.080]   Jesus.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.120]   Of course, the works, the scriptures, and John the Baptist does, and Moses does toward
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   the end.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.560]   But he is the one who is the witness.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:54.120]   To God, the Father is true and now he's functioning as a witness to Jesus Christ.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.600]   In 333, God is called true.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:04.200]   So even in the beginning of the gospel, he's trying to present him as the one who is true.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:10.160]   But for John, it's rooted in Psalm 31, verse 5, for example, "Into your hand I commit
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.160]   my spirit."
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.000]   John 19, right?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.480]   What's the ending of that verse?
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.800]   "You ransomed me, O Lord, God of truth."
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:25.040]   Isaiah 65, verse 15, "He who is blessed in the earth will be blessed by the God of truth,
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.680]   and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth."
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:33.840]   So John has taken us back to the gospel, to the Old Testament as much as possible to tell
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:40.480]   us that this is the God that I am referring to who sent Jesus Christ, the God of truth.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:46.120]   And 728, Jesus Christ out in the temple teaching and saying, "You both know me and know where
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   I've come from.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:52.160]   I've not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you do not know."
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:58.800]   So you have a couple places in John that specifically address God as the one who is true.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:05.500]   And we already saw that in 826 and 827, "I'm speaking the truth from the one who sent me,
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   that is the Father."
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.920]   So you can develop some of that on your own.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:15.720]   There's a third category, and that is truth and pneumatology, truth and pneumatology.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.960]   That's the spirit language.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.680]   So in the end of chapter 15, verse 26, Jesus says, "When the helper comes, whom I will
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.960]   send to you from the Father, that is the spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.820]   will testify about me."
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.920]   So now the spirit is not just the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.320]   If you consider the Holy Spirit being presented in the rest of the New Testament, he's the
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   Holy Spirit.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.000]   We know that.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.880]   In John, he's not only the Holy Spirit, he's the spirit of truth.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.640]   So he's trying to add that quality to the third member of the Trinity to make sure that
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:58.320]   as you think about the Trinity through John's lens, it's always every member has truth qualitatively
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.080]   a part of their presentation.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   All of them.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:07.000]   And it's not to divide the Trinity in any way, but to say, "I'm going to present each
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.760]   one and the role that each member plays in your relationship as a disciple, but all of
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.320]   them are presented as true."
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.880]   And here, verse 26 of 15, he's presented as the witness.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:29.360]   Again, cosmic battle or cosmic trial is the language that's being represented here.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:36.040]   Now in 1417, you can see that the spirit is also a spirit of truth whom the world cannot
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.040]   receive.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.260]   It doesn't see him or know him.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.320]   You know him because he abides in you and will be in you.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.500]   And then in chapter 16, verse 13, he is the spirit of truth.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.640]   He will guide you into all truth.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:54.080]   He will not speak on his own initiative, but whatever he hears, he will speak and he will
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.440]   disclose to you what is to come.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:02.760]   So between those three passages, you've got the spirit dwelling, he's permanently abiding
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:10.140]   with the believers, he's convicting the world, and he's guiding us into all truth.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.200]   But how does he do that?
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.000]   Verse 13 of chapter 16.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.780]   He's not originating truth about Jesus Christ.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:23.640]   He's simply taking what has already been revealed and he's now disclosing it to them.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.680]   And of course, the last phrase most likely is referring to the writing of the New Testament.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.420]   He will disclose in the future more of what is to come.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.720]   And so John's presentation of the spirit is he's a spirit of truth.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.140]   And now we get into the cognitive element.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.240]   It's incarnation on Christ.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.100]   It's qualitatively true in the father.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.560]   But now let's tap into the cognitive presentation of truth.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.240]   He's trying to kind of close this loop around the Trinity and truth.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:01.160]   So the spirit uniquely fulfills the role of helping us actually understand, illumination,
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.880]   is that language, the word of God, as it speaks about Christ.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.480]   That's the ending of chapter five.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.760]   You search the scriptures, but they speak of me.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:18.280]   So now the spirit is that agent who is activating our understanding and then applying it to
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.200]   us when it speaks about Jesus.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.820]   Cornelis Benema, who's a John scholar, said this, "The paraclete will lead the disciples
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.440]   into a more perfect knowledge of Jesus' teaching.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:37.380]   The paraclete does not bring independent revelation, but interprets Jesus' revelation.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:44.660]   He draws out the significance of the historical revelation in Christ."
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:49.960]   And of course, being cessationists, you understand what that means in the canonical sense.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.340]   We have a closed canon and now the spirit is activating and applying and illumining
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:59.800]   our minds in order to fully understand what is the scriptural revelation and application
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.180]   to us about Christ.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.740]   So you can make these applications.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.360]   The spirit's role, well, it's to be with us forever.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   It's to empower us.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   That's chapter 14.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.360]   That's chapter 7.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.100]   Secondly, to teach us.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.940]   That's chapter 16, verse 13 and 14.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:21.400]   It's to remind us, 1426, of what we know about Christ.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.880]   It's to testify, 1526, about Christ.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.700]   It's 1613 to guide us into truth.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:34.340]   In 1614, it's to glorify Jesus and ultimately to facilitate peace.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.880]   All of that is in the context of those passages.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.660]   He's the one who brings peace to us, the paraclete does.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:47.220]   So John is now saying there's an element that the second member plays in regards to truth,
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.260]   the Father and the Spirit.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.200]   But there's also a connection that John makes between truth and bibliology.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.580]   That's the fourth category we should consider, truth and bibliology.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:10.000]   So back in chapter 8, verse 31, continuing in his word makes us or demonstrates that
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.840]   we're true disciples and that is what lets us know the truth and then making us free.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.140]   So now you have to understand it's dual, like I said a minute ago, it is a dualistic presentation
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.980]   or dual presentation rather.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:27.700]   It's Christ and his objective word and that would be a reference to Scripture.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:33.060]   Back in chapter 5, 39-44, you search the Scriptures, objective reference, you will have freedom
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:38.300]   in them, they speak of me, incarnational reference.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:47.540]   Carson writes the following about the Spirit's role in all of this and specifically the role
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.900]   of the Scripture as it activates itself in our lives.
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:57.540]   He says this about John 17, "No one can be sanctified or set apart for the Lord's use
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:03.000]   without learning to think God's thoughts after him, without learning to live in conformity
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.540]   with the word that he has graciously given to us."
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:11.340]   And that is the point of 17-17, sanctify them in your truth, your word is truth.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.780]   So now we run to that verse all the time to talk about how to help somebody become more
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:15.780]   sanctified, right?
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.740]   How do you fight your sins?
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.480]   The word of God, there's no other means and that's true.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.660]   But John is trying to say that word is not simply the means, it's the truth and there's
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.740]   no other option.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.900]   Even for Jesus, we know that from Matthew 4, from Luke 4, the temptations of Christ,
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:37.820]   he constantly leaned on Scripture even in his own demonstration of being separate from
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.820]   this world.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:44.740]   Constantly, so there's only one means whether it's Christ as the example or us as those
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.140]   who are being sanctified.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.140]   So that's Bibliology.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.220]   But there's a fifth category and that is mission.
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:43:00.660]   I read the last verse or the next to the last verse and all that is true is intended to
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:08.500]   bring about belief at the end of chapter 20 as well.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.740]   This is why I wrote it so that you would believe at the end of chapter 19 verse 34-35.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.740]   This is true.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.500]   This is the testimony so that you would believe.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:24.940]   So John is trying to say in multiple places and multiple ways, my goal is missional.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:31.860]   And that mission of belief is tied to the truth that I am presenting specifically, like
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.100]   I said, through the witnesses.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.740]   I think it's a good way for us to divide the Gospel of John into two parts.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.100]   The witness of John the Baptist, chapters 1 through 12, and the witness of John the
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.460]   Apostle, chapters 13 through 21.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:48.580]   And if you've considered that before, John 1, 6 through 19.
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.580]   This is the witness.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.300]   He's not the true light, but he was a witness to the light.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.340]   So from the very beginning, he's been presented as a witness to the light.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.380]   In 333, John the Baptist is a witness.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.340]   533, he is a witness.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.340]   You've seen him.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.700]   He testified to the truth.
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:10.060]   And then 1041 and 42, it says he didn't perform any signs, but everything John said about
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.140]   this man was true.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.920]   And then the narrator says, "And many believed in him."
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.480]   And John the Baptist leaves the scene in the story.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:25.480]   So chapter 1 to chapter 10, the very ending, John the Baptist is that first John as a witness.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:31.620]   And then it changes, and you get to 13 through 21, and John the Baptist never reappears.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:35.380]   John the Apostle takes the scene over and over and over.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.860]   He's in the bosom of Christ, or next to Christ, and all that.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:45.700]   So you know that presentation, meaning he's trying to present two witnesses to the truthfulness
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.220]   of the story.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:51.660]   A Samaritan woman in chapter 4 is presented as a witness.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:57.740]   She goes and tells the villagers of Sikar, "I think I found the Messiah."
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.740]   And they affirm that he is the Messiah.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:08.180]   The truthfulness of her statement, verse 42 says, "He truly is the Savior of the world."
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.660]   That's a factual statement, but you still have to understand that now they're affirming
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:17.440]   the truth of what she told them about Jesus the Messiah.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:23.220]   And I think if you've done any research into John 4, you'd have read that there was a temple
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.820]   to Augustus in Samaria.
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:30.780]   And it said, "Augustus, Octavian, is the Savior of the world."
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.820]   Son of God, Savior of the world.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:40.140]   So it's strategic, I believe, for John to put that confession in that city.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.420]   Because constantly she would be passing, or they would be passing, that kind of a Roman
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.860]   propaganda statement.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.580]   And that's all it was.
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:52.980]   It was just propaganda activated by him when he became the emperor, attaching himself to
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:57.420]   Julius Caesar, deifying him, and thereby becoming the Son of God.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.980]   But I think it's important to understand that's what he's trying to convey to us.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:06.660]   Yes, the Samaritan woman and the villagers of Sychar thought, or read, rather, that he
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:11.220]   might be, that Augustus might be the Savior of the world, or the Son of God.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.940]   But John says, "No, this one is the true Son of God."
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.780]   And the goal in all of this is to make sure that you believe that.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:23.460]   Well, there's a final category, and that is truth and worship.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:31.380]   And that does keep us in John 4, in the middle of this discussion between Jesus and the Samaritan
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.380]   woman.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:36.100]   Verse 22, Jesus says, "You worship what you do not know.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.360]   We worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.600]   But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.160]   spirit and truth.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.440]   For such people the Father seeks to be his worshippers."
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.960]   The whole point is, it's not about the place.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:06.320]   It's actually about understanding that the Father demands that you worship truthfully.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.320]   And even putting both of those substantive, spirit and truth, so closely together, without
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:19.720]   any kind of an article dividing the two, tries to link them as close as possible in the grammar.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:25.200]   You have to have both if you're going to be a genuine and an accepted worshipper.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:30.300]   It has to be truth, and it has to be done in the spirit.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.780]   Stanley Porter kind of points that out uniquely.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.000]   So what is John's meaning behind that?
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.400]   I think Carson captures it the best when he says this, "It must be in spirit and truth,
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:50.560]   essentially God-centered, made possible by the gift of the Holy Spirit, and in personal
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:57.920]   knowledge of, and conformity to God's Word made flesh, the one who is God's truth, the
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.040]   faithful exposition and fulfillment of God and his saving purposes."
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.240]   So if he's already presented the spirit as the spirit of truth, and he will develop that
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:12.600]   of course beyond chapter 4, and now he says this is the true meaning.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.820]   I am the one who gives you the water of life.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.740]   I am who's going to satisfy your thirst and your hunger.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.840]   Ultimately then this is how God expects you to worship.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:26.160]   So get this, this is the missional application of John.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.600]   It's not just about the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, and Scripture.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:35.640]   It is missional, and ultimately it is to the point of worship.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.520]   And I'm just trying to put out those, place those verses in front of you that are unique
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:45.880]   to John, not to create some kind of a feud between the synoptics and John, but to say
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:52.360]   John is trying to do something very different in the 90s, 30 or so years after the synoptics
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.580]   have been written, to show you need to think differently about the concept of truth in
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:02.880]   relation to every member of the Trinity, in relation to the Holy Scripture, and in relation
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.840]   to what God demands of you.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:09.960]   And it's Spirit-empowered, and it is truth-based.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.600]   And you cannot elevate one over the other, hence the omission of the article in the middle.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.200]   No, you have to have both if you are going to be an accepted worshiper.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:25.280]   And I think the most appropriate way to end is to take us to the ending of 1 John 5.20.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.640]   Because if all of the gospel is intended to present Jesus as the Son of God, the one who
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:38.080]   brings eternal life, and then the first epistle is intended to develop some of those elements
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:43.480]   and ultimately say there is a conflict within the Christian community now.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:50.280]   A simple way to find the difference between John and 1 John is to say John is about, it's
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.880]   outward facing, there's conflict from outside, and so he's trying to encourage the believers
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.880]   who are being persecuted.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.120]   1 John, there's conflict within, they went out from us.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.680]   Remember that passage?
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.720]   So now there's a conflict from within, and he's trying to correct their theology about
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:08.920]   Christ, and in 5.20 he says this, "We know that the Son of God has come, and has given
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.600]   us understanding so that we may know Him who is true.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.240]   And we are in Him who is true."
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:20.760]   There's that statement of being, and in His Son Jesus Christ, this is the true God and
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   eternal life.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:29.800]   Why does that not sound like 17.3 or 20.30.31, proving that the same individual wrote both?
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.640]   As much debate as exists about that authorship issue.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:39.400]   But he's trying to tie all of those elements together at the end of this letter.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:44.400]   He is true, He's communicating to us who is true so we may know Him, we are in Him who
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.880]   is true, He is the only true God and eternal life.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:53.160]   And so as you think about John, and you develop those 55 references to truth in John, I hope
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.200]   you always make it theological.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   Not factual, not philosophical, move away from the Gnostic books that give you commentaries,
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.720]   there's plenty of them, to try to Gnosticize John.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.480]   That's not in any way what John is trying to accomplish.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:13.640]   The best proof of that is look at the statements that have to do with truth in John, they lean
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.960]   on the Old Testament.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.840]   Understanding everything in the Holy Scripture to then say now here's the application in
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   Christ.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.800]   We have a couple of minutes, any questions?
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:32.120]   Alright, I was either very clear or completely unclear.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:36.240]   There's one question, nope, no question, alright see, even that was a fake question, okay,
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   no questions.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.520]   Well man, enjoy the conference, have a great afternoon and hopefully you've enjoyed it
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:41.960]   so far.
