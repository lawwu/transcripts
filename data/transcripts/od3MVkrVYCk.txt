[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   On this Monday morning, we jump right into the deep end to talk about the pathway from
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.720]   orthodoxy to demon theology.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.120]   Heavy topic, one inspired by a text we find in Paul's first epistle to Timothy.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.080]   Here's the question from a podcast listener named Leland.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.120]   "Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for taking heavy questions on the podcast.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.280]   I have one of them."
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.280]   Indeed he does.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.360]   In 1 Timothy 4.1, Paul writes that some professing Christians "will depart from the faith
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:44.360]   by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons."
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.160]   This seems like a very stark transition for once-professing believers.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.200]   What does this look like?
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.720]   Can it really mean that Christ-worshippers become blatant demon-worshippers?
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.300]   Or is this move far more subtle?
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.480]   Can you explain to me what's happening in this text?
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.480]   This is a good question for giving us an opportunity to clarify two things.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.400]   First, can a true born-again worshipper of Jesus be led astray into the kind of demonic
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.600]   deception that Paul has in mind?
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.080]   That's one.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.960]   And second, how does this happen?
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.780]   Or what's going on here?
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.780]   Or does the departure from the church into involvement with demonic teaching happen suddenly
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.520]   or gradually?
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.760]   Now, the reason I raised that first question is because Leland's question, for me, has
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.580]   an ambiguity in it.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:50.520]   On the one hand, he refers to "professing Christians departing from the faith to demons,"
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.200]   but on the other hand, he asked the question about Christ-worshippers departing into demon
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   worship.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.840]   So, it wasn't clear to me whether he was asking about genuine Christ-worshippers or whether
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.320]   he was asking about professing Christians who are not genuine Christ-worshippers deep
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.700]   down in their hearts.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:24.960]   I think Romans 8, verse 30, teaches that those who are predestined are called, and those
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.240]   who are called are justified, and those who are justified are glorified, so that no genuinely
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:44.000]   called and justified Christian ever falls away into demon worship, not permanently anyway.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.020]   So then the question becomes, and I think this is what he's asking, what is happening
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.060]   when people in the church who've been in the church for years and are outwardly identifying
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.760]   as Christian and yet are not truly born again, what's happening when they are swept away
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.780]   into the teaching of demons?
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.620]   So let me read the text that he's referring to.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.300]   "Now the Spirit expressly says that in the later times some will depart from the faith
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:29.100]   by devoting themselves to or paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.060]   through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and require
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.900]   abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.220]   believe and know the truth."
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.540]   So what's going on here?
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.060]   Well, first Paul says there are deceitful spirits.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.820]   They would be manifesting themselves through people who claim to speak in the name of some
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.040]   supernatural being in some charismatic way, perhaps with a spirit of prophecy, the kind
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.540]   of thing that John referred to when he said in 1 John, "Do not believe every spirit."
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.260]   Do not believe every spirit.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.300]   So Paul's talking about spirits of demons here, deceitful spirits.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.780]   This is the kind of thing John was referring to in 1 John 4, 1, where he said, "Do not
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.460]   believe every spirit."
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.360]   That's what Paul's talking about here, deceitful spirits.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.320]   Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.180]   for many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.100]   So Paul is concerned that professing Christians will pay too much attention to deceitful spirits
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.940]   and not test them with biblical truth and be carried away into the teaching of demons.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:04.440]   And then he says that through these spirits there arise cult-like practices which contradict
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.560]   biblical teaching that look religious.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.940]   In this case, he's talking about forbidding marriage and forbidding certain foods.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.000]   And then he says that these cultic practices have advocates whose consciences are seared
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.140]   and who lie about what the Bible teaches and deceive people away from teaching the truth
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.060]   and away from living by faith in Christ.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.680]   And when that happens, he says, you can see that these are teachings of demons, because
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.420]   that's what the goal of demons is, to lure people away from Christ.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:53.220]   And Paul points out that this kind of departure from the faith will be intensified in the
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.060]   later times.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.660]   That's verse 1, 1 Timothy 4.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:05.940]   The danger of seduction by deceitful spirits and teachings of demons is always present
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.340]   throughout this fallen age, from the time of Jesus till Jesus comes back.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.540]   They're always there.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.460]   But there will be a greater temptation as the end of the age approaches and the Lord
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.980]   draws near.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.700]   And Paul describes this in 2 Thessalonians 2.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.340]   The people are worried that the day of the Lord may have come, and Paul says, no, no,
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:36.460]   it hasn't come, because first there has to be this great apostasy, this falling away,
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.660]   this rebellion, this deception.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.260]   A great deception comes first.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.540]   Let no one deceive you.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.620]   This is verse 3 of 2 Thessalonians 2.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.180]   Let no one deceive you in any way, for that day will not come unless the apostasy comes
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:01.140]   first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:08.620]   Then he says in verse 7, the mystery of lawlessness is already at work.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.860]   In other words, even though there will be a great deception of lawlessness at the very
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:22.460]   end of the age, nevertheless, the spirit of deception is always at work in some measure
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.420]   in this fallen age.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.740]   And he describes it like this.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.660]   Now, this is verses 9 to 12.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:36.100]   The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.180]   wonders and with all wicked deception.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.420]   That's what Paul's talking about in 1 Timothy.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.900]   Deception for those who are perishing because they refuse to love the truth and be saved.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.260]   Therefore, God sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false in
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:02.940]   order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:09.100]   And Jesus said in Matthew 24, 12, "Because lawlessness," same lawlessness Paul's talking
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:15.780]   about in 2 Thessalonians, "because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.820]   cold, but the one who endures to the end will be saved."
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:27.820]   In other words, the mystery of lawlessness will have a huge impact on nominal Christians
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.720]   whose love for Christ is shallow and unreal.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.140]   They will grow cold, their resistance to the deception of demons will give way, and they
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.780]   will not endure to the end.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:48.780]   This may happen gradually as a church falls away from preaching the truth and the people's
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.700]   love for Christ becomes more and more perfunctory.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.020]   You see this in churches.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.900]   It's tragic to watch.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.900]   Just becomes perfunctory.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:03.480]   They're just going through the motions, and all the former seeming passion and biblical
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.420]   faithfulness for Jesus is gone, and then come the deceitful spirits, and these folks are
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:16.620]   vulnerable to being swept away into a great deception and the teaching of demons.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.420]   Or it may happen suddenly.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:25.380]   A satanic miracle worker comes to town with a ministry of signs and wonders like Simon
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.060]   in Acts chapter 8.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.660]   He takes people by storm because their roots are so shallow.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:41.600]   They're more dazzled by the deceitful miracles than by the beauties of Christ and his salvation
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   and his teaching.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:50.340]   Oh, the need, oh, the need for depth and rootedness in the truth in our churches.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.880]   This is a word for pastors.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.400]   So this is why Paul urges us in Ephesians 6 to put on the whole armor of God that we
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:05.820]   might stand against the wiles of the devil and keep alert with all perseverance, praying
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.740]   earnestly to be spared this kind of deception.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:16.460]   If we remain in the grace of God and treasure Christ above all, we will be kept.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.340]   That's 1 Peter 1.5.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.820]   It's so precious.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.820]   I love this promise.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.260]   I put it on my mother's gravestone with my father's permission, in fact, kept by the
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.260]   power of God.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.540]   But here's what the text says.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:36.700]   By God's power, we are being guarded, being kept through faith for a salvation ready to
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.660]   be revealed in the last time.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.300]   So that's our hope.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:45.580]   Those whom the Lord calls, the Lord keeps.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.780]   So precious.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:54.060]   You mentioning 1 Peter 1.5 in the context of your mom, Ruth, and the testimony you take
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.140]   from her life, it reminds me of a previous episode where you talked about this a little
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:05.060]   bit more and the circumstances in which she passed into glory back in ABJ 1577.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.220]   Even more details in ABJ 1433.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.300]   If you haven't heard that story, I commend those episodes to you.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.900]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:22.780]   You can find the ABJs 1433 and 1577 at AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.880]   Speaking of parents, parenting teens is up next.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.420]   Parenting teens can be very challenging.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.860]   And Wednesday, we're going to look at what Pastor John calls the hardest thing to do
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.420]   in parenting teens.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.540]   The hardest thing to do in parenting teens.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.540]   But it must be done.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.380]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.740]   We will see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:52.740]   [END]
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.800]   you
