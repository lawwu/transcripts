[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   A listener named Ray writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I'm a young teenager.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   A few months ago I got caught up in this book I was reading which had a sexual scene in it, which I read.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   At the time I was too glued to the book to set it down, even though I knew my mom probably wouldn't want me to read it.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Since then I have not thought about it because I don't really think of it as a sin in my mind
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   because I was confused about whether or not my dad would be okay with it.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I don't struggle with lust and I don't think about sex and haven't thought about what I read until now.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Now I'm wondering if I should tell my parents about it.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   The reason I don't want to are these.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I have a good relationship with them and they trust me and I don't want my freedom to be taken away
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   because I don't struggle with this. I don't want to hurt them or scare them.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I don't want to send my parents into a panic because I don't struggle with lust or want sex.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's embarrassing. The reasons that make me think I should tell them,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I don't want to hide things from my parents. I want to have an open, honest relationship with them
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   since I am commanded so many times in the Bible to treasure their wisdom and to honor them.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   But is it necessary to tell them this to be open and honest?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Do I need to confess a sin that I'm not really sure if it was a sin?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So in the end my question for you is, should we confess to our parents all our sins
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   even if they don't seem to be a big deal and even if we don't struggle with them anymore?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   So first of all, thank you, Ray, for the courage to ask the question
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and the clarity of laying out the pros and cons of taking this to your parents.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   My answer to your question is partly influenced by that,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   by what kind of person I see you being, what kind of young woman you are.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So understand that I'm reading into your mind a kind of maturity and balance
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   that is affecting the way I answer. So my answer to you is yes,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I think you should talk to your parents about this.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And I'll give you my reasons and you can weigh them and see if they're compelling to you.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   First, you are clearly burdened by the memory of this scene in your reading
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   and your failure to put the book down and talk to your mom or your dad about it.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And the very fact that it concerns you enough to write to us,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I think that means it would be good to lay that burden down by talking to mom and dad about it.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That will lift it from you. If you look back on the event as a sin,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   which it sounds like you do, then the Bible tells us,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   "Confess our sins to one another and the promise of healing would come," James 5.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Here's a second thought. I think you are in a good place right now to speak to your parents
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   because sex has not made you its slave.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The day could come when you get sucked into kind of difficulty with sexuality
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   that would be way more harmful than just having seen a scene in a book.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And then it would be a lot harder to talk to your folks.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And so this seems like a good season, a good time in your life
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   when you can bear witness to them that you're not enslaved by your sexuality.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You're not entangled like some have become, and I think that will encourage them rather than put them off.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Third, it sounds like you have a good relationship with your folks,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   and that would be a good time to be honest with them
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   rather than if the relationship would be troubled someday.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And it sounds like a relationship of trust, and so I'd venture that.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   The fourth thought I had was I think it's generally a good thing to err on the side of candor and honesty and openness
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   with people, including our parents, rather than secrecy.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I think that gets us in trouble when we keep secrets from people that are close to us,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   so that would be another reason I think you should move forward in talking to them.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And a fifth thing is I think the upshot of your talking to them will not be that they distrust you or that trust you less.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I think they'll trust you more.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   At least surely that was my experience with my children, my sons, and my daughter.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   If they came to me with some confession of something they did,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I was way more eager to trust them and believe them than I would have been if something had turned up indirectly
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and I found that they were keeping something from me.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So I doubt that you'll make your parents distrustful of you if you're honest about this.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And the sixth thing is the Bible says, "Honor your father and mother,"
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and trusting your parents is a huge honor to them.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I just feel so honored if my children trust me with some difficulty that they're having.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And the final thing I'd say is, Ray, never, never forget the gospel of Jesus,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   that He died precisely for this sin that you're concerned about, that it would be forgiven,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   that no matter what happens about anybody's response to you and your honesty,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Jesus is for you and will give you the help you need and the strength to press on in the path of righteousness.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So I admire your courage and your humility, and I'll pray that God would make it good when you talk to your folks.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And we are back with a new episode tomorrow.
