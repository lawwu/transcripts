[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.740]   Well, the Bible says a lot of bold things, and it raises all sorts of heavy topics and
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.940]   perplexing questions for us to consider.
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.540]   And one of the heaviest questions is this, "In comparison to eternal judgment on many,
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.240]   wouldn't it have been more loving for no one to have been created in the first place?"
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.740]   It's a question from a podcast listener named Jonathan, and certainly a question others
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.980]   have wondered about, too.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.180]   "Hello, Pastor John, so grateful for your ministry and for this podcast.
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.900]   I know there are some questions we will not get answered on this side of eternity, and
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.900]   I believe my question may be one of them.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.340]   But I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.620]   If God knew that the majority of humanity would reject him and end up in eternal torment,
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.500]   wouldn't it have been kinder or more merciful to not create them in the first place?"
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.660]   I suppose the Apostle Paul's response would be Romans 9.20, "But indeed, O man, who are
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.660]   you to reply against God?
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.200]   Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, 'Why have you made me like this?'"
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.020]   So I guess Paul is saying, in other words, God is not taking a vote on what he should
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.900]   or shouldn't do, and I guess that leaves us to simply trust and believe that his foreknowledge
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.580]   of most of humanity's future eternal damnation doesn't compromise his character in creating
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.340]   them anyway.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.260]   Is there anything more to say here?
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.220]   I think where Jonathan ends up is where we will end up, namely, with our hands on our
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.380]   mouths and our knees on the ground and our heads bowed before the wisdom and holiness
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.660]   and righteousness and goodness of God in choosing to create a world in which he knew that millions
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.700]   of people would reject him and suffer eternally because of it.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.340]   There are things hidden from us now, according to Deuteronomy 29.29.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.740]   The secret things belong to the Lord.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:07.460]   And 1 Corinthians 13 9-12 put us in our place where Paul says, "We know in part and we prophesy
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.900]   in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away, for now we see in a mirror
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.620]   dimly, then face to face.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.780]   Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known."
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.180]   And I think that this limitation that Paul's talking about refers not only to our knowledge
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:39.280]   of facts about God and his ways, but just as important, this limitation refers to our
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.940]   capacities to evaluate accurately and feel appropriately the kind of emotions that are
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.460]   suitable to the facts.
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.940]   That's a limitation also on us.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.140]   In other words, we may see a truth more or less clearly, but not have the emotional wherewithal
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.060]   to feel what we ought to feel or to process the truth in relation to other truths so that
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.060]   it has the emotional effect on us that it ought to have.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.780]   And when that's the case, then Jonathan's conclusion is, I think, exactly right.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.640]   These instances of revelation that leave us emotionally off balance are occasions for
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.860]   trust in the fullness of divine wisdom, wisdom that we cannot fully see now.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.860]   But Jonathan asks, "Is there anything more to say?"
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.060]   And the answer is yes, there's lots to say, more than we can say here that would inform
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.700]   how we think about such questions.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.340]   So let me just say a few things.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.560]   The first thing that probably we ought to say might be the most important thing in this
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.780]   APJ about this problem of why God would create a world that leads to so many people suffering
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:14.540]   in hell is that it is a problem shared by Calvinists and Arminians and even open theists
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.540]   who don't even believe that God has exhaustive foreknowledge of what will happen when he
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.580]   creates the world.
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.620]   Calvinists, of course, have the question because we believe that God has planned everything,
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.960]   all things that come to pass, and that includes eternal judgment.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.620]   So we've got the question.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:45.580]   Arminians have the same question because God foresees fully the effects of human self-determination
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.160]   as they believe it, namely, eternal judgment is going to happen, and God creates the world
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:01.660]   anyway evidently thinking that the cost of self-determination is worth the gain.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.660]   Is it?
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.340]   So they have the same question.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.760]   And open theists have the same question because on their view, even though God doesn't know
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:18.240]   how things are going to turn out, God considers it worth the risk to create the world anyway
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.220]   knowing all possible future worlds, and if it turns out that it wasn't worth the risk,
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.860]   that reflects pretty badly on God's wisdom and goodness in moving ahead with the risk.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:40.700]   Now, of course, you can get rid of the problem entirely by being an atheist so that we have
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.100]   no God to reckon with at all, or you can be a universalist who believes that there is
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.580]   no judgment and everybody gets saved in the end, or you can be an annihilationist who
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.960]   believes that judgment consists in putting people out of existence who don't believe
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.700]   in Christ, or you can believe God is evil.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.700]   Bang.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.620]   Those seem to me to be the options in front of us.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.420]   Now none of these is a very happy solution.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:24.760]   If you go with atheism, you give up not only God, but the only ultimate ground of human
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:31.980]   personhood and dignity and truth and beauty and goodness, everything that makes life worth
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.840]   living and all you have left is matter and energy and time, a worldview of emptiness
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.580]   and futility and despair.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.900]   If you go with universalism, you give up the deep seated human conviction that there is
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.680]   such a thing as impenitent evil that ought to be punished.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.140]   If you go with annihilationism, you have to convince yourself that non-existence, being
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:12.940]   put out of existence, is a suitable punishment for such impenitent evil, when in fact it's
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.260]   the very thing that impenitent evil people want to happen.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.980]   That's what they're hoping for, is to go out of existence.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.980]   And if you go the route of believing that God is evil, then you embrace a worldview
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:33.700]   that is not only despairing and meaningless, but terrifying, since there is no such thing
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:41.620]   as grace or any foundation of goodness or hope or mercy for any of us.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:49.980]   In the end, it comes down to whether you have seen the compelling, self-authenticating signs
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:59.080]   of God's glory and truth in the Scriptures and in its center, Jesus Christ winning you
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.260]   over to the trustworthiness of God's Word.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:13.020]   All these worldviews stand or fall not finally by whether we can think up enough negative
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:20.380]   or positive consequences for each worldview to arbitrate between them, but rather which
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.860]   of them accords with the Word of God, the Bible.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:32.820]   It's because of the Bible, because of Jesus in particular, that we believe in hell as
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.740]   everlasting torment.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:41.500]   Jesus is the one who made this so clear in his teachings in the Gospels.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:48.300]   It's because of Jesus and what he taught that we believe that God's judgment will be perfectly
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.700]   proportionate to a person's impenitent sinfulness.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:00.100]   Jesus is the one who said there were degrees of punishment and everything will be impeccably,
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.180]   perfectly meted out.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.460]   No injustices, no wrongs done.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:12.260]   It's because of Jesus and his Word that we believe that the way that leads to destruction
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.900]   is broad and many there be that find it.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.640]   We're not doing the math, we're just listening to Jesus.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:28.700]   And it's because of Jesus that we believe not one dot, not one iota will fall to the
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.620]   ground of God's Word.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:40.100]   The Word that teaches that God is righteous and good in all his ways and that the display
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:46.820]   of the fullness of his glory for the joy of his penitent people is the ultimate goal of
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.860]   creation.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:58.820]   And according to Romans 9, 22 to 23, this glory includes his wrath and his power and
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:08.020]   his mercy in proportions that are just and right and good, even if we can't see it perfectly
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.020]   now.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:19.260]   So it comes down to this, the truth and authority of God's Word and the supreme worth of God
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:25.220]   as the golden thread that runs through the scriptures.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.660]   So Jonathan is right.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:34.340]   We are not in a good position to pass judgment on the wisdom of God given the limits of our
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.940]   minds and the weakness of our hearts.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:48.580]   We do well to humble ourselves with trembling and to be amazed that we are vessels of mercy
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:57.440]   and to bend every ounce of strength that we have while we have breath to bring others
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.220]   out of darkness into God's marvelous light.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.220]   Amen.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.700]   Listening to the very blunt words of Christ, trusting in his finished work and seeking
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.860]   by his power to reach as many centers as possible with the good news of the gospel.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.100]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that balance, and thank you for listening.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.780]   Well, how do we find freedom from our worries?
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.980]   One of my favorite answers to this question is from the Apostle Paul in Romans 8, verses
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.380]   13 to 15.
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.620]   Here he writes this, "For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.580]   But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.200]   For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.060]   For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.300]   the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:52.740]   We battle sin to be free from worry, and in that battle, we demonstrate our faith in Jesus
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.740]   Christ.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.940]   And I'm sure Pastor John will explain this dynamic to us when we return on Wednesday,
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:06.180]   how we defeat our sin, glorify Christ, and find freedom from our worries.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.420]   That's up next time on Wednesday.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.420]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:08.420]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.720]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
