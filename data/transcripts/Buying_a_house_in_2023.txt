[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.960]   talk about buying a house in 2023 because if you have been waiting since
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.520]   October 2022 to buy a house I think a window, a big window has emerged. Now it's
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.240]   not a table-pounding buy like I thought in mid-2020 when my conviction level is
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.800]   like a 8.8 out of 10. It's more like a 6.5 to 6.8 out of 10
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.900]   conviction level but that's high enough where I think if you buy now you're not
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.000]   gonna regret it especially if you negotiate hard and well because I think
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.360]   in one or two years home prices will be higher than they are in mid-2023. So to
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.440]   recap what was my 2023 housing price prediction? You know obviously we're only
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.520]   four months in so anything can happen but I expected about an 8% decline in
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.080]   the median home price because of higher mortgage rates namely an overly
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.360]   aggressive Fed, a potential recession in the economy, earnings recession in the
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.000]   S&P 500, and high prices that were simply unaffordable to a lot of the
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.440]   median home buyer. But if you look at the data you'll see that on the East Coast
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.200]   home prices seem to be more stable or even up a little bit. On the West Coast
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.800]   home prices are down 5 to 10 percent so given I'm on the West Coast I'm seeing
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.480]   more opportunity and because I'm seeing more opportunity I'm more bullish. So
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.720]   keep that in context as you listen to this podcast and as you read my post on
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   buying a house in 2023 in the show notes. So first of all where are we in terms of
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.080]   the national median home price? Well according to Redfin March 2023 saw a
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.600]   3.3% decline in home prices. So if you take a look at the show notes and take a
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.080]   look at the chart you'll see this big decline in home price appreciation
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.800]   because it's now depreciating. February 2023 showed the first year-over-year
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.000]   decrease since 2012 and this is the largest year-over-year decrease since
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.480]   2012. So if you're a buyer this is great if you're an owner well not so much but
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.960]   look at 2022 the S&P 500 went down 19.6% and the housing market well it was kind
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.360]   of flat maybe it was down several percent right. So if you can buy a home
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.640]   between 5% to 10% below last year's levels I think you're gonna do pretty
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.760]   well. So here are three reasons why I think buying a home in 2023 mid-2023 and
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.400]   maybe fourth quarter 2023 is a safer bet now. Nothing is a guarantee but I think
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.960]   it's safer to wade in the waters and I don't think you're gonna regret it a
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.120]   year or two years from now. Alright first of all there is a lot of pent-up demand
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.040]   especially since the fourth quarter of 2022. Pent-up demand for homes yet
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:16.000]   inventory is still below 2022, 2021, 2020 and pre-pandemic levels. Since October
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.880]   2022 specifically there's been a stalemate in the housing market. Sellers
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.660]   don't want to sell because they have great mortgages many under 3% so why
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.840]   sell and then lock in a higher rate mortgage and buyers didn't want to buy
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.680]   because well mortgage rates were going up the bear market was happening the Fed
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.760]   was aggressive and it's like well why don't we take a wait-and-see approach. So
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.600]   it's been seven months since October 2022 and every month that goes on with
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   one person not buying a house creates more pent-up demand and what have we all
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.040]   been doing since the second half of 2022? Well we've been saving more cash and
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.920]   we've put in putting that cash to work in higher yielding Treasury bonds,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.840]   Treasury bills and money market funds which now offer four to five percent and
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.560]   that's a really attractive return based on the past ten years when we were
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.160]   getting less than you know 0.2% on our money. So this combination of more cash
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.120]   and more higher yielding cash has built up over seven plus months. But the thing
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.120]   is life continues to go on while you wait for the opportune time. You know
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.560]   babies still get born, people still get married, people still relocate for better
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.120]   job opportunities and so forth. So as this pent-up demand builds I think the
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.880]   wave of potential capital back into the housing market is going to get stronger
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.880]   and stronger and I think that wave is coming by the end of this year.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.200]   Personally I have been saving aggressively if you saw my post on how
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.160]   I'd invest $250,000 today, 60 to 70 percent of that cash has been used to
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.880]   buy Treasury bonds and then the remaining has been nibbling in the stock
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.680]   market, private real estate market as well as the public real estate market.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   Look at the home building stocks. The home building stocks are on fire in 2023
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.240]   up 20 to 30 percent. DR Horton, Toll Brothers, KBH, it shows there's a lot of
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.880]   demand for at least new homes and well these home builders are deploying a
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.920]   strategy of buying down the mortgage rate to make it more affordable for
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.280]   buyers but this is a good piece of evidence that there is demand out there
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.720]   for homes. Now then if you look at let's say VNQ, the Vanguard Real Estate Index
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.360]   ETF, it's lagging and I think this lag, the six-month lag, is important to
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.960]   understand if you want to be a good real estate investor. Which brings me to
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.280]   point number two, the stock market has rebounded a lot in 2023 by about 8% this
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.960]   year and even more since October 2022 when the rate hikes really started
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.360]   getting more aggressive. In general, real estate lags the stock market by about
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:18.680]   six months. So the bottom of the S&P 500 was in October 2022, six months ago and
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.480]   since then we're up double digits right? Therefore if you can buy real estate
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.520]   with prices down five to ten percent and the stock market stays flat over the
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.640]   next six months, I think you're gonna see a catch-up in real estate prices over
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.800]   the next six to twelve months by five to ten percent. And this is why I say this
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.520]   window of opportunity is emerging. The window might only be, I don't know, three
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.520]   four five months at most before the capital, which is always looking for the
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:00.960]   highest rate of return, fills up this gap. And once that gap is filled, the spread,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.960]   you know, the catch-up just narrows to the point where, well, you don't have as
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.200]   great of an opportunity to make money. Psychologically, I think all stock
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.560]   investors, especially long investors, feel better right now. We feel richer. Man, just
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.480]   a month ago we had bank runs, deja vu of 2008 with Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.120]   Washington Mutual all going under. And I definitely thought, hmm, could this be the
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.400]   start of a cascade of bank runs? So far it hasn't. You know, obviously there's
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.120]   probably more banks out there, plenty of banks that are losing money if they mark
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.920]   to market. However, it looks like the Fed is not gonna make the same mistake as it
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.880]   did in 2008 and it's going to step in and be the lender of last resort, which
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.520]   is good for the overall economy. Also, if you look at what Wall Street strategists
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.760]   were forecasting for the S&P 500 at the beginning of this year, the median price
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:04.360]   target was about $4,033. It ranged from around $3,400 to $4,600. And sure, there are
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.280]   definitely bears still out there, like Mike Wilson from Morgan Stanley, who's
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.120]   predicting $3,000 on the S&P 500. But then there are bulls out there, like Tom
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:20.040]   from Fundstrat, who's always perma bullish, who's focusing on $4,600 and above. So at
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:27.840]   current levels, around $4,140, $4,150, we are a couple percentage points above the
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.800]   median S&P 500 target price for 2023. And I think that makes people feel good. We
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.760]   feel better, we're richer, we spend more money on things we don't need and on
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.760]   experiences that we enjoy. And that's good for corporate profits. And we
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.960]   definitely are gonna spend money on housing because we still spend so much
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.680]   time at home. And we all know that real assets hold their value much better than
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   funny money paper assets. I think we've gone through this multiple times before
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:03.360]   to the point where owning real assets like real estate, jewelry, fine art, wine,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   fine wine that can be consumable, you know, at least there's some value in
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.920]   these things that we buy and it just doesn't go up and down on our computer
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:17.320]   screen that offers really no value. So I expect more stock market capital to flow
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:23.600]   into the real estate market. Personally, I'm reducing my exposure to public
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.080]   stocks from about 30% of my net worth to 25% of my net worth. At current levels,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.160]   $4,150, it feels like I got a second chance. Yeah, we're still down from the
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:40.120]   highs, but we're not down to $3,577, the recent low. It feels like, ah, second chance
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:45.600]   to take some profits and to buy real assets and to stabilize my net worth
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.480]   volatility. And I think many people feel this way. Alright, the final reason why I
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.920]   think buying a house in 2023 is gonna be okay is because mortgage rates have
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:03.880]   peaked. If you look at the data, June/July 2022 was the peak in CPI inflation. We
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:10.960]   were at about 9.1% in June 2022 and the latest data in March 2023 showed 5% for
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:17.200]   the CPI. So clearly, inflation has peaked. As a result, mortgage rates have peaked. As a
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.560]   result, the Federal Reserve is thinking, well, maybe one more rate hike in May and
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.520]   that's it, we're gonna hold. And if you look at expectations for future Fed funds
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.640]   rates, the expectation is there's gonna be Fed funds cuts over the next 12 months
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:38.440]   after May. So rationally, many buyers, many home buyers, just have been waiting
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:44.800]   to see how high the Federal Reserve would take the Fed funds rate and waiting
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.440]   when will inflation finally break. You know, a couple months does not a trend
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:57.760]   make, but now it's seven, eight, nine months of declining inflation. So as a
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.920]   result, we see the light at the end of the tunnel and when you see light at the
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.000]   end of the tunnel, you can better model your future housing expenses and you
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.560]   have more conviction to buy. Now, savvy real estate investors actually don't
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.240]   mind getting a mortgage at a high rate if they can get a purchase price at a
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.040]   much lower price. Because at the end of the day, you can always refinance your
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.840]   mortgage, but you can never change the purchase price or the sale price of a
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:33.000]   home. Therefore, if you were to buy a house, let's say in mid-2023, let's say
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.120]   with a 6.25% mortgage rate, yeah, that's not the best, but if you got a great deal,
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.960]   let's say 8 to 10% off, and then mortgage rates fall by another 1 or 2% in a year,
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.000]   you can always refinance and save money. And as mortgage rates decline, demand for
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.200]   housing increases, thereby helping push up home prices. Alright, now that we
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.800]   talked about the three positives to potentially buying a house in 2023, let's
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.280]   talk about three or four negatives. The first negative is that we go into
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.120]   another recession. Recession is technically two consecutive quarters of
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.480]   downward GDP growth. We had that last year and we have an earnings recession in
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.120]   the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023 so far. So maybe we're
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.280]   already in a recession and if this is as bad as it's going to get, well, things
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.920]   aren't too bad because the stock market and investors are forward-looking.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:34.000]   However, if we fall back down into a deeper recession or a recession that's
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.760]   worse than expected, thanks to, you know, the Fed funds rate going to 5 to 5 and a
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.080]   quarter percent, and there's also a lag, right? Once you start tightening, there's
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.360]   a 6 to 12 month lag where consumers stop spending so much and start saving more.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.040]   Then that could weaken housing demand. That probably will weaken housing demand.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.480]   What I'm looking for is the unemployment rate, which is currently at 3.5%, going to
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.640]   5%. If we get to 5% on the unemployment rate, it's very feasible because back in
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.600]   March 2020, the unemployment rate went to like 14%. Then I expect housing market
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.680]   demand to slow. And then if we go to like 6.5, 7%, I definitely think the
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.880]   housing housing prices will probably go down 10 to 15% if we get to that bad of
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.360]   an unemployment level because that's millions of jobs lost. But I assign, you
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.280]   know, maybe like a 30% chance we get to 6% unemployment. I think things are going
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.320]   to be kind of, you know, will fade a little bit. Unemployment rate might go to
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.240]   4%, 4.5%, but it's kind of generally in line with the natural rate of
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.800]   unemployment level. So I think it's going to be fine, but that is a risk. The other
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.360]   risk is that the stock market goes back down another 10 to 20%. Another bear
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.240]   market, right? We do have highly paid Wall Street forecasters who are thinking the
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:01.520]   S&P 500 could go to 3,000 to 3,600. And if that's the case, I think people are
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.840]   going to step back and say, "Wait a minute. We're probably in a recession again and
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:12.360]   let's hold on to our cash that's earning hopefully over 4% while we wait things
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.080]   out some more." I only sign about a 20% probability we go back to the recent low
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:25.120]   of 3,577 on the S&P 500, but it could happen. So recession and a bear market and
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:31.320]   stock market. The counterbalancing mechanism is a decline in Treasury bond
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.640]   yields, right? Because if things are going bad, people are going to go flight to
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.480]   safety, which is Treasury bonds. And then Treasury bond yields go down and
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:44.040]   mortgage rates go down because mortgage rates tend to track the 10-year Treasury
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.680]   bond yield. Another risk to the buy housing in 2023 call is if inflation
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:57.880]   stays sticky at 5%, right? It peaked at around 9.1% in mid-2022. It's now about
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.000]   5%. If it stays at 4.5% to 5.5%, well, that's not
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.640]   gonna be good because the Fed will raise the Fed funds rate or at least keep it
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.280]   at 5% to 5.25% for longer than expected. Right now, the market is
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.960]   expecting the Fed to cut within the next 6 to 12 months after it raises in May. I
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.720]   mean, I don't know why they need to raise and then cut again. Just keep it the way
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.360]   it is. But that's what the market is saying. Sticky inflation is a risk. I mean, I
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.960]   just went to fill up my tank and it was a hundred bucks because $5 per gallon
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:36.000]   here in San Francisco again. So if energy prices go up, well, there's a risk to
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.840]   inflation. But the good thing is that shelter inflation, i.e. rents, have been
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.760]   coming down over the past 6 to 8 months and that's a leading indicator.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.920]   Whereas the CPI index that we see, you know, is always a lagging indicator. So
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.560]   over the next 3 to 6 months, because shelter inflation has been coming down,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:59.640]   which accounts for about 30% of CPI, we should see downward pressure, further
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:05.200]   downward pressure in the inflation number. The final risk to the housing
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:13.800]   buy/call in 2023 is commercial office real estate. So, so far, the return to work
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.920]   trend has been happening, but it might be slower than expected for building owners
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.720]   and lenders. A lot of these commercial office buildings are on floating rates,
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.400]   not long-term 30-year fixed rates. So as rates go up, you know, you're gonna see an
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.480]   increase in defaults of commercial office building owners. And that could
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.240]   cause a cascade effect, a negative effect, for the lenders who lend to these owners.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.400]   We saw the bank runs with SVB and Signature Bank and Credit Suisse, and it
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.960]   just takes a little bit of spooked-out investors where, you know, one bank says
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.000]   they had too much exposure to office buildings, and then that could create a
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.960]   domino effect. So please be aware of the commercial office building space. More
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.080]   companies are asking their employees to come back to work because I think
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.720]   they're finding that productivity might not be as high as working at home, even
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.760]   though I think most people who are on it are way more productive at home. But I
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.520]   think it's human nature, right? The human nature to just, you know, go walk the dog,
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.280]   take a nap, go play pickleball. Here, I'm at the pickleball court right now
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.320]   recording this podcast because, hey, it's a really nice day. It's just human nature
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:31.200]   to not work as hard if nobody is governing you as much. So I do expect
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.080]   more employees to go back to the office, which will help the commercial office
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.320]   building space, but it's just something to watch, folks. Alright, I hope you

[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.840]   region where valuations are lower and net rental yields are higher. They focus on
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.800]   single-family and multifamily homes, which are much more sticky than
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.880]   commercial office real estate. If you enjoyed this podcast episode or this
