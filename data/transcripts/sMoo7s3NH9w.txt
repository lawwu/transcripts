[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.320]   - Welcome back to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.160]   I am here with the one and only Nikola Jokic.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.000]   My boy here.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.320]   - My boy.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.160]   - Appreciate you getting on my back.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.000]   - Of course.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.040]   - All right, so I kind of want to start
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.920]   with some basketball stuff.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.840]   Then we'll move to some, you know, off the court.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.400]   So obviously you're a two-time MVP.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.320]   You know, we won the championship last year.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.000]   And one thing I've always been impressed with
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.960]   is how you continue to get better and better and better
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.920]   as years go by.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.400]   How do you stay motivated now
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.240]   that you have achieved so much at so young?
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.760]   - That's actually a nice question.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.920]   I think the motivation is actually,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.720]   becomes your lifestyle of being obsessed with the success.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.720]   I think winning is a lifestyle for us right now.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.320]   I'm thinking about the team right now.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.400]   Like, I think like we can win every game.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.640]   And I think it's like winning is kind of lifestyle
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.760]   and you're getting obsessed with winning and that lifestyle.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240]   It's really, we have fun when it's winning.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.200]   - Yeah, we talked about that yesterday.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200]   Yeah, like, and when we lose, it's like.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.960]   - It's like, no way.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.280]   - Yeah, we don't feel right.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520]   We won so much now that we just don't feel right losing.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920]   - I think that's the, like,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.840]   I think that's probably my motivation.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.840]   Just like obsess of winning and that kind of lifestyle.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.720]   - I agree.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720]   - One thing, I don't know if you remember this.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.280]   My, I think it was my rookie year
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.400]   or maybe it was my second year.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.600]   And I asked you, I texted you the question.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.460]   I was like, how do you deal with pressure?
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.720]   Because you, and everyone kind of notices this is about you.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.120]   In the clutch moments, you know, at the end of the games,
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.440]   you always are just like this.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.560]   No matter what is happening,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.120]   you always perform under pressure
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.640]   and you never seem rattled.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.960]   So I remember I asked you about that
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.380]   'cause that was something I just really admired about you.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.580]   And your answer was, I don't know if it's the same now,
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.920]   but your answer then was like,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.420]   I feel the fear, I feel the pressure,
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.180]   but I just accept it and I deal with it
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.900]   and I just go do what I need to do.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.460]   And you said you prepare so when the moments come,
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.060]   you don't feel like you haven't prepared.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.180]   Is that kind of the same?
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.780]   - It's interesting because I think if you're not scared,
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.940]   if you're not pressured, if you don't feel nervous,
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.580]   I think you didn't choose the right sport.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.020]   I think that's a normal thing and you must have that.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.940]   I think you just, I think the most important thing is to,
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.580]   like I said, prepare yourself for that moment.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.180]   Okay, it's gonna, you think in your head,
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.260]   okay, this play, a crowd, we are playing home away.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.820]   We were losing or we were winning,
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.540]   so you need to, like, I put scenarios in my head,
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.340]   like what can, okay, this play, what can happen here?
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.740]   So I'm kinda already lived that in my head.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.820]   So what happened on the floor,
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.020]   of course, sometimes it's different,
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.020]   but kinda that makes you prepare for whatever happens.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.700]   And I think, but just from the beginning,
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.220]   pressure and fear, like even now,
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.620]   I think of every game, I have a pressure, I have a fear.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.060]   The guy on the opposing team is gonna beat me.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.460]   I think, I think you must have that
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.180]   or maybe I'm just different thinking, you know?
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.020]   - No, I agree.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.340]   I just think you carry yourself in such a way
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.620]   that no one would be able to tell on the outside
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.220]   that you, you know, you carry pressure
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.260]   'cause you just seem so, you know, nonchalant, non-caring
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.740]   and it lets you play so free.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.740]   How much time do you think you actually prepare?
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.420]   Is it like when you step foot in the arena,
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.500]   now your mind is on basketball or is this something,
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.820]   you know, that you carry with you even at home
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.460]   or like do you separate the two?
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.140]   - I think you, like my game starts this night, tonight,
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.820]   you know, and ends up after I stretch
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.340]   or after I like, you know, we are lifting together after.
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.580]   So like my game doesn't end when it's zero in the clock.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.020]   My game ends like when I'm stretching
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.180]   or when I'm driving home.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.220]   That's when my game ends.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.620]   - Oh yeah, routine.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.060]   - But it's not like I'm obsessed with my routine
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.940]   but I'm kind of trying to not make a big deal of my routine
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.860]   but still kind of doing it, you know.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.620]   I don't want to say if I don't lift
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.540]   or something's going to happen, you know, no.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.060]   Like I'm going to do it and it's,
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.820]   I'm trying to kind of cruise through my routine.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.540]   - Right, and it's not like people
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.860]   sometimes have superstition.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.300]   - Yeah, it's not like if I cross the line
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.140]   or if I like, I need to make five in a row.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.220]   Like I don't have that.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.100]   Like sometimes, I mean, I'm shooting in a warmup.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.380]   If I miss, I just go to the next spot
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.460]   and like, it's not something that I'm like,
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.580]   I need to do this, you know.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.580]   So I think that helps me to maybe alleviate the pressure.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.740]   Like, because pressure is the game.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.580]   Routine or warmup doesn't need to be pressure, you know.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.420]   - Yeah, this is part of your life.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.180]   - Yeah, but my game starts probably tonight.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.700]   Like even now you kind of start thinking, okay,
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.420]   like you, you have max truths
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.060]   or whoever is your next opponent tomorrow,
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.140]   like, aha, this is what he's going to do.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.340]   Run off, non-run off, shooting, not shooting,
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.540]   dribble, like whatever.
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.180]   He's a good in a pocket.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.980]   For me, he's a good post-up player.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.380]   I need to box him out.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.260]   Like you need to, that's how I'm, you don't need to,
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.220]   but that's how I'm thinking.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.580]   Like slowly kind of build up.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.980]   - To the actual game.
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.340]   - Preparing myself to the game.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.860]   And I love to be prepared.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.700]   That helps.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.220]   Maybe actually that helps me with the pressure too.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.500]   Like being prepared for the game.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.260]   Like, you know, I'm really good at reading the plays
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.100]   and like knowing what they're going to run.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.140]   And that kind of helped me with the pressure.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.140]   - Cause you just.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.340]   - Okay, I know what's going to happen.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.940]   You know, it's.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.860]   - Yeah, there's a call out, call out plays
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.820]   that we didn't even go through
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.820]   and walk through or anything.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.020]   - I guess the Clippers, you remember?
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.860]   - Yeah.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.220]   - Mike's standing here, right here.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.460]   - Bro, I was like, wait, what?
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.580]   I remember that.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.780]   - But man, as far as routine, that was one of my questions
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.900]   because early on in my career,
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.260]   your routine wasn't the same as it is now.
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.420]   You know, I remember you were way more,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.940]   I don't know if it wasn't that you didn't care
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.820]   about basketball as much,
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.740]   but it just seemed like you didn't,
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.780]   you just were good,
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.540]   but it didn't seem like you cared as much.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.500]   You didn't put as much effort into your body.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.340]   You didn't.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.380]   - Oh yeah, the beginning of my career was,
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.260]   you know, I was just,
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260]   I came here just to make it, let's say it like that.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.580]   You know, I came here as a third, fourth option,
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.620]   fifth option in some,
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.620]   so I was just kind of trying to play and to,
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.700]   and I was young, you didn't know nothing about it.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.220]   You know, like you think it's just a basketball.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.900]   It's basketball is probably like a 20% of everything else.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.980]   It's like basketball is,
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.700]   I'm going to say for me right now, basketball is easy.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.620]   You know, basketball is something that,
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.900]   you know, you're going to get tired, you know,
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.420]   you miss make some nights good, some nights bad.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.420]   But I think when you learn your routine,
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.380]   like even first, I'm going to say first three years,
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.100]   like you starting to learn more and more and more.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.020]   And then when your routine is kind of,
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.260]   I'm going to say like my third or fourth year,
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.020]   I was kind of, okay, I need to do this.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.660]   I need to change diet.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.820]   I need to lose weight.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.500]   I need to, or maybe I can shoot.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.020]   Maybe I can like youth.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.620]   - Just develop it as time goes.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.740]   - Develop it through the time, yeah.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.140]   - Yeah, for people that don't know you,
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.820]   you're such a normal and like humble guy.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.660]   You like to have fun.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.780]   You like to do normal things.
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.340]   You know, you're not someone who really wants to be famous.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.500]   That was never your goal in being great.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.900]   So what would you say is the hardest part
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.700]   about being like a global superstar?
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.300]   Like the pros and the cons of really just being famous.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.100]   - Yes, I mean, I really don't like this life
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.740]   because on the other day, we were just basketball players,
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.940]   you know, so we are just good at what we are doing.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.940]   But media is something that is around us.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.220]   And of course we're getting paid because of the media,
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.020]   because of popularity, you know, so.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:29.460]   But being famous, I think some people like it.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.140]   Some people don't.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.020]   I really, when I finished my career,
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.380]   I really wish nobody knows me.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.820]   And I really wish my kid or kids in the future
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.620]   who knows really remember me as a dad,
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.780]   not as a basketball player, you know.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.020]   I think that's gonna,
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.740]   I'm gonna say that's gonna be my goal in life.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.700]   And to not have phone,
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.380]   I think that's another big goal of mine.
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.740]   Just to be, to live in the moment.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.420]   Like you said, like being a normal person,
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.500]   living in the moment,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.180]   like go drink with your buddy or go have lunch
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.660]   or go play with the kids or go drive horses.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.100]   And nobody's gonna make a big deal of that.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.100]   Like I feel now, like even if you go outside
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.700]   and do anything, throw something next to the trash can,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.260]   oh, Mike didn't throw this in the trash.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.980]   Like it's, people are making a big deal
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.500]   of such a small things.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.500]   And just feel sad whenever you go to the bar, restaurant,
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.100]   some game, people are just taking the phones
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.220]   and out and trying to record you.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.700]   I think that's really, I'm gonna say rude.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.540]   - Yeah.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.900]   - It's because it's your life.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.500]   I'm not, it's not that I'm showing myself.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.380]   I'm just who I am, living your life.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.020]   - Yeah, you're someone who keeps your private life
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.860]   very private.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.220]   Like I remember when you did get married,
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.980]   like I don't even think anybody really knew about it.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.140]   - Yeah.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.220]   - So when it comes to that, how did you meet your wife, man?
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.300]   How did you know that she was the one?
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.620]   - So we met, I know her since I was 14, 15.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.700]   - Oh, so yeah, she's from.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.460]   - Yeah, she lives five minutes away from my house,
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.500]   from my home.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.500]   And we were friends for like a couple of years.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.780]   And then she actually came here the summer
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.020]   that she was supposed to, when she came here,
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.260]   that summer, before that, we kind of started,
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.780]   I'm gonna say dating.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.780]   And she was playing volleyball in Oklahoma.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.860]   And we were kind of having long distance relationship.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.860]   So how I knew it, to be honest, I didn't know it,
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.140]   but it just happened to be, I think, to be honest,
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:59.660]   everything in my life, I never expected it to just go,
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.020]   told my life go slowly, like uphill, slowly.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.940]   I never had some to knock on wood.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.500]   I never had some big draft.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.820]   So it's like slowly, slowly uphill.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.940]   - Yeah, when you talk about that,
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.940]   when you first got in the NBA and you realized like,
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.900]   okay, I can play with these guys,
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.620]   and then you got on the court,
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.380]   I think Nerkic might've been ahead of you at that time.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.820]   You say like, everything just happened to you.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.700]   Did you realize when you first started playing
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.860]   how good you could be?
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.100]   Or was it something that you just kept working,
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.580]   you kept your routine, and you just got better?
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.140]   Or was it something when you first got on the court,
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.500]   you're like, I think I could be the best player in the league?
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.540]   - I think that's impossible.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.540]   But I think, maybe one of the questions from earlier,
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.980]   motivation, is that kind of don't relax.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.580]   If you relax, if you start thinking about that, I think,
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.780]   you're just gonna like, okay, I'm good.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.220]   You're gonna stop doing what you're doing, you know?
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.780]   Yes, but when I came here, I was a fifth option.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.660]   There was like JJ Hickson, Kenneth, Joffrey, and Nerk,
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.980]   and they were all in front of me.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.180]   And then one year, me and Nerk started to play together.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.780]   That didn't work well.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.460]   And, I mean, I asked to go to the bench,
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.100]   just because the team, we didn't win a lot of games.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.860]   And maybe just, you know, to give myself a chance,
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.700]   or, you know, to play a position
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.020]   that I was supposed to play or whatever.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.600]   So, and since then, a couple months after that,
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.260]   I was starting, I was in the starting unit,
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.880]   and like I said, it's uphill, slowly uphill,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.900]   the whole life, I'm gonna say.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.140]   - I think that's crazy.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.380]   This is another conversation we had.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.740]   Well, actually, backtrack.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.700]   I wanna ask you this, because this is a conversation
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.420]   that kids in America always have.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.660]   You know, even NBA players in America,
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.460]   I don't know if it's the same in Serbia,
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.420]   we always talk about who's the best players.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.460]   And the big conversation on social media is, you know,
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.140]   who's the best players in the league, who's top five.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.180]   But no one ever hears from, you know,
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.460]   I think right now, probably,
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.500]   you are the undisputed best player in the world.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.660]   So excluding yourself,
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.420]   who would you say is, you think it right now
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.900]   in the league is top five?
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.980]   - Right now in the league?
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.300]   - Right now in the league.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:31.900]   It's tough, there's a lot of talent in the league right now.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.800]   - I think there is a lot of talent.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.420]   I think, I'm gonna say, Joel, Luka,
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.900]   I mean, you gotta put KD and LeBron there,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.060]   so even they're a little bit older,
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.580]   but I think they can still perform.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.860]   - You still got, like, Steph, you still got--
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.740]   - Steph, you know, I think it's so,
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.460]   the talent, and then you have Tatum and--
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.300]   - Giannis.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.380]   - Giannis, you know, it's--
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.220]   - You can't really say top five.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.260]   - I think it's really impossible to say.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.020]   I think maybe you like some other player
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.460]   more than some other player, like his game or whatever,
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.460]   but I think it's really hard to put that top five,
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.300]   or even top 10, to be honest.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.140]   I think it's--
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.460]   - Yeah, any given night, guys can kind of float
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.540]   in and out of there, yeah, I agree.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.300]   One thing that makes our team so special
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.780]   is your ability to be able to figure out defenses.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.620]   So if they double, you know, from here,
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.380]   we always talk about it in walkthroughs,
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.260]   this is what we're doing.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.300]   Or if they double from somewhere else,
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.140]   this is what we're doing.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.060]   So one of the reasons we won a championship
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.900]   was your ability and our ability as a team
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.300]   to kind of figure out different team strategies,
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.660]   and we pretty much have come up with a plan
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.500]   for every strategy.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.820]   - We had the answer for everything.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.300]   - Yeah, who do you think then gave what gives you,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.100]   you personally, the biggest challenge, like defensively?
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:05.900]   - I think when, that was the bubble, right?
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.220]   When they had like, they had three, four big guys.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.620]   - Oh yeah, the Lakers, AD, Dwight.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.700]   - Yeah, they had like AD, Dwell.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.580]   - Oh yeah, that was tough.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.220]   - You know, because it's--
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.380]   - They could put a big guy on you,
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.220]   but they have another big guy.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.660]   - Yeah, that kind of, it's like what Minnesota did us,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.420]   you know, when they put Townsend,
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.100]   and Rudy was like kind of behind him.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.580]   I think those kind of situations that,
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.580]   but I think like my game, whatever style, whatever it is,
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.100]   it's so, like I don't need just post-up,
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.340]   like I can play pick and roll.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.660]   I can set pick and roll, I can come off the screens.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.620]   You know, I can just play in the open area.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.700]   Like, I think it's not just one thing
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.940]   that I'm doing on the floor.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.340]   - I agree.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.380]   Man, so outside of basketball,
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.260]   'cause everyone knows you for a great basketball player,
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.780]   but you know, we're not gonna be doing this our whole lives.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.660]   We probably got, you know, 10 years top.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.820]   - Five, 10 years.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.740]   - Five probably for you.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.700]   - No, no, five, 10, I don't know.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.340]   - Where do you see yourself,
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.460]   I'm gonna say 15, 20 years from now,
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.100]   we've had the conversation before
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.620]   how, you know, one of your goals is to not have a phone.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.260]   You wanna live like a normal person.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.580]   Can you do that in Serbia?
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.260]   Or where do you see yourself in how you live in 15 years?
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.980]   - I think after the career's over,
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.620]   I think the whole kind of publicity is gonna gone.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.220]   And I think I'm gonna figure it out.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.620]   But how I want to see myself is to be around the family,
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.700]   spending days, probably my kid,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.500]   kid right now, one kid, but who knows.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.980]   Maybe they're gonna say play some sport.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.700]   Maybe they're gonna do something interesting,
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.340]   follow them a little bit,
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.060]   and spend the rest of the day with the horses, you know.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.220]   I have a couple horses outside of Serbia,
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.220]   in Italy, in Sweden, in France.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.900]   Go, maybe race, actually that's kind of my secret goal,
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.900]   to be a driver, like to have fun, you know.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.180]   Travel the world, or Europe, and race horses.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.140]   That sounds fun.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.380]   - Yeah, that sounds good, like I'm the same way.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.220]   We actually have a team who's not really big
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.780]   into the, you know, the fame thing.
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.700]   Like there's a lot of guys
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.100]   that aren't really big into social media.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.940]   And I think that kind of is what
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.020]   makes us all enjoy each other.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.900]   None of us is trying to like,
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.180]   so I think that's cool.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.340]   Besides that, I think my last question for you would be,
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.700]   what is your purpose, you think?
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.260]   Like besides inspiring kids to do basketball,
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.700]   I don't know if that's what your purpose is,
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.540]   but you know, you got a family now.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.580]   What is your purpose,
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.300]   and why do you kind of feel like you're here?
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.780]   Like why do you think God gave you these talents?
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:54.540]   - When, if you remember, when we won the championship,
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.340]   they put like a video of the people,
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.100]   like celebrating at their homes.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.940]   - Yeah.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.780]   - I get goosebumps, crazy.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.260]   Like we affect so many people,
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.540]   just by playing basketball.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.500]   So I think it's make people happy,
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.460]   you know, make other people happy.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.860]   I think that's supposed to be our goal.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.900]   Like that, when I realized,
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.900]   when we won the championship,
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.260]   that I was like, for me, it's like, okay.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.300]   I felt more relief than joy, if that makes any sense.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.180]   And when I saw the video, I was like,
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.020]   oh, we affect so many people,
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.900]   like old, young kids, parents.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.780]   Like it's, it was like, this is a big thing, you know?
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.620]   - Yeah.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.820]   - And by the end of the day, we were just playing basketball.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.540]   So I think, I think that's why we're on this planet Earth,
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.060]   to make other people happy.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.860]   - Well, I think that's what makes you special, bro,
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.820]   is like your ability to be like selfless.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.740]   Like it shows up in all areas of your life,
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.220]   the fact that you don't want to court how selfless you are,
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.060]   but also that you feel like your purpose
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.940]   is to make other people happy.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.300]   The fact that even though you hate media,
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.780]   you know, I hit you and I was like, bro,
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.140]   would you hop on this podcast?
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.380]   And you're like, yeah, bro, anytime,
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.220]   wherever, whenever you want.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.540]   Like, I think that's something,
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.860]   another thing I admire about you.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.340]   So I just appreciate you getting on.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.660]   - Of course, I'm not gonna lie,
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.500]   the best questions since I came to the NBA.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.460]   For real, for real.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.820]   - Appreciate you, though.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.260]   My boy, I appreciate you.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.100]   - Thank you, my friend.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.940]   - Thank you, appreciate it.
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.780]   - Carry his mic out.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.620]   - Yeah.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.020]   (hip hop music)
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.780]   - Man, Nikola Jokic.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.460]   That dude is a one of a kind dude.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.020]   I could truly say that, you know.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.980]   He's someone who, he doesn't like media.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.980]   He doesn't like media at all, you know.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.140]   So for me to hit him up and for him to just be so,
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.100]   just hop on here, you know,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.380]   just without even questioning what it was, what I'm doing.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.340]   He just was like, yeah, brother, anytime, any place.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.460]   It shows just the type of person he is.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.420]   You know, at the end when he talked about his purpose
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.260]   and like how he truly just wants to inspire people
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.900]   and make people happy, it really shows who he is.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.580]   He's a really low-key dude who never has been for the fame,
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.620]   never has been for his own glory.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.580]   He gets kind of almost like a little shy almost
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.180]   or a little kind of like deflective
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.460]   when people are constantly awarding him
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.340]   or, you know, even when coach brings up his stats
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.260]   in the locker room, he's almost like deflective of it,
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.820]   trying to praise other people and things like that.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.460]   So over the years in my career,
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.620]   like playing with Nikola has made me, you know,
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.420]   obviously a better player.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.580]   You know, he gives me so many open looks,
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.980]   but a better person as well, more disciplined.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.660]   I think more, definitely with the routine and stuff,
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.860]   he's definitely, observing him and how he operates day to day
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.940]   has definitely helped me, but also the way he thinks,
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.780]   you know, how he is after a good game,
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.300]   how he is after a bad game.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   Just seeing his balance in life, you know.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.900]   He's become a good friend of mine over the years,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.660]   and I never would have thought that my first couple of years
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.340]   just because we're so different.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.140]   I didn't understand his jokes.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.780]   He didn't really understand my culture
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.660]   and how me and my friends joke around.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.860]   But now it's crazy to see him kind of open up
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.100]   and just his personality has evolved
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.660]   and he's joking around just like us,
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.380]   and he's wanting to go out and go to dinners
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.620]   and do the things that we do.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.620]   So it's been really enjoyable playing with Joker.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.580]   What's another thing he talked about?
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.580]   I think just the not wanting to be on social media.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.620]   He talked about one of his goals as,
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.620]   you know, when he's done playing,
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.060]   not wanting to even have a phone.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.100]   This is something that we've talked about as well.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.780]   We've had a lot of little conversations over the years
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.580]   where we're just chopping it up.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.340]   I'll ask him questions, what he thinks about stuff,
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.620]   'cause I just see how different he is.
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.780]   And he said, you know, one of his goals
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.660]   is to not even have a phone when he's done.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.580]   I think that that is very admirable
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.860]   just because of the day and age we live in.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.100]   You know, people, I don't know if it's an American thing,
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.660]   but people are so thirsty these days for clout,
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.380]   for attention, for one-upping other people,
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.860]   for, you know, self-glory and being the man.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.780]   And that's one person.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.220]   If there's anybody that I know
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.380]   that has the ability and the right to self-promote
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.460]   and show off that they're the man is Nikola.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.340]   You know, he is back-to-back MVP,
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.900]   finals MVP, world champion, you know,
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.300]   and he keeps getting better every year.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.860]   He probably could be the MVP, like,
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.700]   every year of his career 'til he's done
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.540]   just because of the way he fills up the stat sheet,
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.620]   what he does for our team.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.080]   You know, as long as we keep our core together,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.140]   we're gonna win a lot of games.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.060]   So it's very realistic that he could be
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.560]   in the MVP conversation for the next five, six, seven years.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.340]   So if there's anybody who could self-promote, it's him.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.420]   But he chooses not to.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.980]   He chooses not to have an Instagram.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.380]   He chooses to keep his private life very private.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.260]   He chooses not to do the media.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.700]   And I just think that that is,
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.440]   like, that's a special characteristic
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.120]   and it's something that not only me,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.340]   but a lot of people can learn from
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.040]   because he has it all, you know.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.260]   He is who he is, but he chooses to humble himself,
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.020]   to live his life, to, you know, make other people happy,
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.320]   inspire other people.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.660]   And who knows?
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.020]   I don't know if it's an American thing,
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.620]   but we are just so absorbed in ourself, you know,
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.380]   in our own brand, pushing our own brand.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.680]   Worried about ourself.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.380]   That's something that I think we can learn from Nicola
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.940]   and just this episode of what he was talking about.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.940]   Man, and then he talked about, you know, his wife
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.780]   and how he got married,
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.700]   how he knew it was the one or whatever.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.980]   And that's weird because everyone I know
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.260]   in the NBA who's married,
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.060]   it's like someone from their childhood
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.540]   or someone who they grew up with,
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.980]   their childhood sweetheart.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.220]   And so I didn't know that he knew her his whole life,
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.600]   but it makes sense.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.580]   So he got a good one.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.220]   You know, he got the kid.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.780]   I've been over to his house
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.460]   and he lives just a very chill, quiet, normal life
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.360]   with his kid and his girl and, you know,
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.500]   his brothers are around.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.220]   So I got to make it out to Serbia.
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.500]   AG went out there this past summer.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.620]   So I'm going to go mess with Joker
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.020]   this, probably this upcoming summer
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.340]   and go see what the horses are about.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.100]   And yeah, go from there 'cause, you know,
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.540]   there's a lot to learn from that dude.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.100]   And it's not even the fact that he's so profoundly,
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.180]   like, outwardly wise.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.620]   It's just the fact of how he lives his life is different.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.380]   And that's what I think that is unique.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.580]   And that's something that people could do more of,
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.820]   you know, conforming to the normal way of life.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.780]   You don't need to do that.
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.180]   You can follow your own heart.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.860]   And I think that takes some inward, you know,
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.940]   getting to know yourself.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.580]   For me lately, it's been journaling,
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.300]   figuring out what I really want in life,
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.140]   who I really want to be, what I really want to do,
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.340]   what my motives are, you know, what my purpose is.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:20.080]   It takes some inward kind of like work, I would say,
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.200]   because there's always going to be pressures
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.320]   from the outside that tell you who to be,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.900]   how to act, all these things.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.140]   But I think he knows himself.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.940]   And that's why he comes off so authentic,
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.300]   because he's not trying to put on a front for anyone.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.140]   He's not trying to live like anybody else.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.900]   He just knows himself and he's unashamedly himself.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.740]   And I think that that is another quality
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.460]   that is rare these days.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.020]   He talked about our team, you know,
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.320]   and what the toughest matchups were for us
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.660]   and things like that.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.740]   And we didn't really give away the blueprint
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.580]   because we found how to work our way around this.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.060]   You know, the Wolves got us earlier this year
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.860]   by putting Cat on Yoke and then they had Rudy roaming.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.020]   There's been some other teams who have done
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.300]   similar things, which I mean, it is, it is a good,
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.260]   it's a good formula.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.700]   And I think the Timberwolves are really,
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.140]   really good this year.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.540]   So they smacked us at their crib, you know,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.900]   but that's nothing new for us.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.300]   I would say some other teams have tried that
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.060]   where they put a guy on Yoke
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.560]   and then they have another bigger guy kind of roaming.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.000]   But man, so much of our success as a team has been
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.720]   because that dude can just, he's a wizard on the court.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.480]   He figures stuff out and then he'll talk to us, you know,
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.320]   and we figured, you know, just playing with him,
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.080]   we figured out ways to figure stuff out on our own too.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.360]   But yeah, that is one of the reasons
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.040]   we won the championship because every team
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.280]   that we played in our championship run
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.460]   tried different strategies.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.320]   You know, if that didn't work,
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.120]   they're switching to something else.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.000]   So yeah, his IQ is his greatest attribute.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.320]   His best skill, I would say, is his touch.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.920]   You know, he doesn't miss those floaters,
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.520]   those layups around the rim,
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.920]   but his best attribute is his IQ
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.800]   and his ability to work around different defensive schemes
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.240]   that are thrown at us.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.600]   Man, we got a squad.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.400]   We really do.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   You know, our core of me, Jamal, AG, KCP, Big Fella,
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.800]   and, you know, the rest of our core of guys off the bench,
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.000]   CB, P-Watt, who am I missing?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.640]   Really, we just got a squad.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.360]   You know, Julian is a rookie who is really, really good.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.680]   He's not getting a lot of minutes right now,
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.280]   but he'll blossom.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.120]   We got a squad, so I'm excited.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.640]   It's crazy because I got drafted to Denver,
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.800]   but so I've never really experienced being on another team,
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.400]   but from the stories that I hear of guys
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.040]   that have been traded to us,
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.000]   we have a different culture, you know?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.040]   And I wouldn't really know that firsthand
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.440]   because I haven't seen these other teams,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.480]   but everyone says, like, man, like,
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.840]   the way y'all operate, the way you play,
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.800]   the way you even act in the locker room,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.880]   how y'all, like, enjoy each other's time off the court
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.720]   is different.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.400]   We really got a team who enjoys being around each other.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.200]   And like I said, man,
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.880]   Joker has not always been someone
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.680]   that I can, like, really kick it with.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.560]   Like, he really wasn't.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.880]   I think we probably just found each other a little weird,
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.800]   you know, which is normal.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.440]   I think people coming from...
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.080]   So he would just stick to his guys from overseas,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.840]   you know, Vlad Coe and some of the strength trainers.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.720]   But over the years, he's really become my boy.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.880]   And we'll do stuff as a team.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.280]   You know, when we were in San Diego for training camp,
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.480]   we went down to Tijuana,
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.240]   almost got stuck over there one year
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.000]   because he didn't even bring his ID.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.600]   So we almost got stuck in Mexico
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.400]   and it was a whole ordeal.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.320]   But we just had fun.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.560]   We went to this little spot as a team, kicked it,
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.160]   probably came back way too late.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.240]   I think we crossed the border back into America
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.400]   like 4.35 AM.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.640]   But we have a lot of stories now as a team.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.080]   It's cool that I've gotten to be here my whole career
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.240]   and I haven't been traded around.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.080]   That's pretty rare.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.920]   So, man, I couldn't ask for a better dude
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.200]   to share the court with.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.760]   And yeah, man, I forgot to ask him about his brothers.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.840]   I wanna ask him, I should've asked him about his brothers
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.960]   because his brothers are some crazy dudes, you know?
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.680]   They'll be at the games
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.760]   and like if we get into the slightest scuffle,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.560]   they're standing up in their chairs, they're ready to go.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.400]   You know, they're definitely ready to go whoop somebody.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.520]   Like his brothers have got his back
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.400]   and I see them all around.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.560]   There's some unique dudes.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.760]   They're a lot different than Yoak.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.240]   Like they carry themselves a lot different.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.880]   But you know you can't play with Yoak
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.920]   'cause his brother's got his back
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.320]   and that's kinda how me and my brothers are.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   Like we all got each other's back.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.960]   So it's cool to see that.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.760]   He's really just a family guy at heart, man.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.760]   He's a low-key, chill, funny family guy at heart
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.920]   who happens to be really good at basketball.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.720]   He never thinks about the end goal of anything.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.400]   I don't think he ever thought about getting MVP.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.240]   He never cared about getting MVP.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.880]   He never thought about winning a championship.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.600]   He just followed the steps in front of him
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.040]   and he was present in the moment
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.800]   and these things happen to be,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.400]   he talked about in the interview about like slowly,
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.160]   you know, he just went up, up, up, up, up.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.360]   And I think it's because he never was thinking
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.840]   about the goals in mind.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.320]   We have a saying in the weight room, habits, not goals.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.680]   I think in America, we have this notion
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.800]   of you have to set these far out goals
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.640]   and these things will make you happy.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.440]   But, you know, from my experience
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.680]   and something I've learned over time is it's the process
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.280]   and it's the habits you build and the person you become
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.480]   that eventually allow you to reach your goals.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.000]   If you just have this goal in mind
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.360]   and you're striving and stressing to get it,
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   like sometimes it will elude you
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.360]   because it causes you to be stressed out, anxious,
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.020]   and you really miss out on a big piece of life,
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.720]   which is the process, becoming who you need to be
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.840]   in the process.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.560]   And that's something that our team as a whole
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.800]   kind of preaches is habits, not goals.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.280]   We're not worried about winning a championship right now.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.260]   We're worried about building the habits
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.760]   that will allow us to eventually win enough games
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.360]   to eventually win a championship.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.960]   And that's something that I think, yeah, over here we miss.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.560]   You know, we think that the certain goal or this thing
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.720]   or that thing will make us happy and then we get it.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   And it makes us happy for a week or two, if that.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.420]   And then you have a new goal
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.820]   and you're not happy until you reach that goal.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.040]   Yeah, I don't think that's the right way to live.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.260]   But for some reason, you know, the American dream,
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:57.260]   that's the whole point of it is to like become somebody
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:02.420]   and do these big things, but you miss out on 99.9% of life
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.320]   because these goals that you may reach are like,
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.980]   they're just a thing that happens to you.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.400]   You know, from firsthand experience,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.380]   I thought all growing up, you know,
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.620]   my goal was to reach the NBA and boom, I got it.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.460]   Now I'm in the NBA.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.140]   Now I'm not playing and I really want to play.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.740]   And I'm like, man, if I could just get on the court,
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.980]   I'd be happy.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.620]   I started getting a little bit of time.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.260]   That fulfilled me for a second, but not really.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.020]   Then I'm like, man, I gotta be a starter.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.720]   I gotta, you know, work hard enough to be a starter.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.520]   Became a starter on the team.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.900]   And then, you know, that's cool,
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.060]   but now you have bigger goals.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:35.920]   You want to be an all-star.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.880]   You want to this, you want to that.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.860]   So over the time of playing with Joker
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.820]   and seeing how those things don't even cross his mind,
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.980]   it's something that I've been able to adapt, you know,
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.380]   and just self-reflection as well.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.820]   You see, you know, people out in the world
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.300]   that have these goals and then they're not happy
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.140]   at the end of them.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.820]   So it's been a process for me,
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:59.660]   but that's something that I think I've grown in as well.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.700]   So man, habits, not goals.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.460]   That's just the whole motto.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.620]   Something he lives by.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.620]   That's something I've learned to live by.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.500]   And it keeps you at peace through the hard times.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.420]   And it makes you look at failures as learning lessons
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.420]   and not, they're not failures.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.880]   They're really learning lessons if you allow them to be.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.220]   And you can build yourself through the failures,
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.980]   sometimes even more than the success.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.900]   So yeah, man, this episode is a special one, obviously.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.060]   I'm glad that Joker got on.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.860]   Y'all got to see a little bit of his personality,
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.700]   how goofy he is off the court.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.220]   So yeah, man, Curious Mike out.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.920]   Appreciate y'all listening to it.
