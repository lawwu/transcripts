[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   In 2015, Pastor John recorded a series of devotionals based on his 2006 book titled
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.440]   What Jesus Demands from the World.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.080]   And it was in one of those devotionals that he made the point that you don't know God
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.580]   if you don't love Christ above all else.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.880]   This point and this devotional really impacted a podcast listener named Tim, who lives in
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   Australia.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.520]   He suggested this clip for the podcast.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.120]   I'm glad he did.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.600]   Here now is Pastor John to explain.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.080]   We all know what Jesus answered to the question, "What's the first and great commandment?"
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.880]   Matthew 22, 37.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.760]   The first and great commandment is you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.680]   and soul and mind, and other gospels say, and strength.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:01.240]   So loving God with your heart and all that you are is the first and great demand of Jesus.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.680]   And then in Matthew 10, 37, it's interesting how these verses are rememberable.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.480]   22, 37, 10, 37.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.640]   Whoever loves mother or father more than me is not worthy of me, Jesus says.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.400]   Whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.500]   So now you've got two powerful, deep, life-transforming commands.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.160]   Love God the Father with all your heart, soul, mind, strength, and love Jesus more than you
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.400]   love children, more than you love parents, surely more than you love anything.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.320]   And my question is, what should we think about those loves?
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.700]   In fact, I have four questions.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.720]   One would be, what's the relationship between them?
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.920]   Another would be, what's the nature of the love?
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.680]   Another would be, where does it come from?
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.700]   How do you get to be this way?
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.500]   And the last would be, how important is it?
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.120]   So let's take those one at a time.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.160]   What's the relationship between loving God and loving Jesus?
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.800]   Now you may think, why is that a big deal?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.360]   Well maybe the reason it's on my front burner is because it is massively relevant for Muslim
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   evangelism.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.680]   I bet you didn't think I was going to go there.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   Like what?
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.040]   Listen, one of the big issues we face over and over again in a multicultural situation
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.720]   where lots of religions are coming together is, don't we all worship the same God?
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.000]   You go through Jesus, I go through another prophet.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.040]   So here's what Jesus says.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.360]   John 8, 42.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.600]   Jesus looked right into the eyes of the Pharisees, the Jewish leaders, and said, "If God were
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.320]   your Father, you would love me."
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.760]   I mean, he's saying to the most religious, the most God-oriented, Old Testament-saturated
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.000]   people on the planet, you don't know him.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   He's not your father.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.640]   In fact, he goes so far as to say, you're of their father, the devil.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.480]   I mean, this is just mind-boggling.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.360]   What's the litmus paper for knowing whether somebody is a lover of God?
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.280]   Answer, do they love Jesus?
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   Do they embrace Jesus for who he really is?
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.640]   Not just some human teacher, not just some prophet alongside other prophets, but I am
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.240]   the son of God.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.880]   So that's the first one.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.720]   John 8, 42.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.840]   What about John 5, 42?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   There it is again.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.080]   8, 42 and 5, 42.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.560]   Jesus says to those same leaders, "I know you don't have the love of God in you.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.600]   I have come in my Father's name, and you don't receive me."
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.880]   You see the implication?
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.760]   You don't have the love of God in you.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.760]   How do I know?
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.880]   You don't receive me.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.520]   So here I am dealing with a Muslim person who says, "Oh, I worship the true God just
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.040]   like you worship the true God."
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.720]   Jesus would say, "You don't know the true God if you don't receive the son of God."
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.800]   So the relationship, the answer to the first question, what's the relationship between
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.480]   loving God and loving Jesus?
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.160]   You can't have the one without the other.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.280]   Loving Jesus is the test of whether you love God.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.680]   Loving God is the test of whether you truly love Jesus.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.240]   So here's the second question.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.720]   What is the nature of this love?
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.800]   Now here's what I have in mind.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.360]   Is love mainly doing what Jesus said?
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.120]   So you love Jesus if you do what he said?
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.840]   Or is it deeper and have to do with the heart and the affections?
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   He said, "If you love mother or father more than me, you're not worthy of me.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.300]   If you love son or daughter more than me, you're not worthy of me," which means he's
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.120]   thinking of the love of Jesus like the love of your children.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.840]   Well you don't love your children by doing what they say, right?
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   They are your treasure.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.400]   You would die for these children.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.240]   They are precious to you.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.080]   You won't sell them for billions and billions of dollars.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.560]   Your children are your treasure.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:40.000]   If Jesus isn't a better treasure, a higher treasure, you're not worthy of Jesus.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I had a teacher in college who made me read a book called Situation Ethics.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.440]   And in it, the argument was made, and every student seemed to be so wowed by this argument.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.960]   Love cannot be an emotion or an affection because it's commanded and you can't command
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   the emotions.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:08.680]   And I'm reading, I'm 20 years old, and I'm reading this thinking, "That doesn't sound
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.360]   right to me."
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.400]   Well it's not right, and the reason it's not right is because premise number one is false.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.920]   Of course Jesus commands the emotions.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.260]   The Bible is filled with commands of the emotions.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.480]   We should fear, we should be thankful, we should be compassionate, we should be earnest,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.200]   we should fear the right things, we should hope.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.600]   All those are emotions.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.820]   Of course God has the right to command our emotions.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:42.560]   The fact that we're so corrupt and so dead that we can't do the right emotion is not
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   God's problem.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.920]   That's our problem.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.960]   It's our corruption.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.340]   So the question is, isn't love for Jesus more than doing?
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.960]   And people will quote what, I think it's John 14, 15, if I remember correctly.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.800]   John 14, 15, which says, "If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   And I've had so many people say to me, "There, right there, it says so.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.840]   If you love me, you'll keep my commandments."
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.840]   There it is.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   Love is obedience.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.360]   It's not feeling any particular thing for Jesus, it's just doing what he said.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.800]   To which I respond, "That's not what you just said it said."
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.600]   It says, "If you love me, then you'll do this other thing called keeping my commandments."
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.200]   Loving Jesus is deep and foundational and transformative because you treasure him above
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.400]   all things.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.480]   And then because of that, you do all that he commanded.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.640]   So my answer to the question, what's the nature of the love?
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.480]   Is yes, of course it would include obedience, but oh, it is not less than being transformed
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:56.920]   by a love of treasuring, admiring, delighting in, being satisfied by this most beautiful
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.040]   treasure of all.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.800]   Like Paul said in Philippians 3, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing value of
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.360]   knowing Jesus.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.880]   Third question, where does that come from?
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.160]   And let's just get one answer from Jesus.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.920]   How do you get to this place?
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:20.680]   Remember the story in Luke 7 about the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to dinner?
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.620]   And so here he is, he didn't wash Jesus' feet, he didn't kiss Jesus, he didn't do anything
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.440]   to show affection for Jesus.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.640]   They're reclined around the table.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.540]   You remember how they ate in those days?
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.640]   The table would be about that high off the ground.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.760]   You'd lean on an elbow, your feet would be sticking out behind you and you'd eat like
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   that.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:45.840]   And suddenly there's this woman of the street, a prostitute, leaning over Jesus' bare feet,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.120]   weeping, and the tears are falling on his dirty feet, and she's taking her hair and
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.120]   washing Jesus' feet.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.700]   I mean, this is incredibly provocative.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.920]   And the Pharisee is bent out of shape and says, "If you knew what kind of woman that
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.760]   was, if you were a prophet, you'd know."
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.520]   And Jesus said, "Let me tell you a little story, Mr. Pharisee, Simon.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.040]   A man had two debtors, one owed him $5,105.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.800]   He forgave them both, which will love him more."
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.980]   And the Pharisee says, "Well, the one that he forgave more, I suppose."
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.760]   And Jesus said, "That's right.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.840]   When I came in here, you didn't kiss me, you didn't wash my feet.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.200]   She from the time I came in has wept over my feet, washed them with her tears, wiped
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:41.320]   them with her hair because she has been forgiven much."
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.000]   So where does it come from?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.840]   What's your answer to that question?
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.460]   Where does it come from?
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.760]   It comes from being stunned by being loved by God, right?
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.720]   It comes from being overwhelmed by the person of Jesus dying on our behalf and rising again,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.000]   though we have no merit at all in ourselves.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.040]   When that grips you, then you will taste what it is to treasure Jesus and delight in Jesus
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.800]   and be satisfied in Jesus, which leads to the last question.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.520]   How important is that?
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.380]   That Jesus said, "If you don't love me more than you love your parents, you're not worthy
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.380]   of me.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.520]   If you don't love me more than you love your children, you're not worthy of me."
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.200]   What does it mean not to be worthy of him?
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.680]   It means you won't have him.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.000]   If you don't love Jesus, you won't have Jesus.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.120]   Paul put it just as starkly as possible in 1 Corinthians 16, 22.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:44.080]   He who does not love the Lord, let him be accursed.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:54.480]   Christianity, what Jesus demands from us is not most deeply and most fundamentally decisions
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.800]   of the will.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.900]   That's later.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:05.360]   Deeply and most fundamentally is this new birth, deep, profound transformation of what
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.680]   we treasure, what we love.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.280]   And if it isn't Jesus, then we're not worthy of Jesus.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.120]   And being worthy of Jesus doesn't mean deserving Jesus.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.920]   It means being suitable to be in his presence.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.480]   When he's your supreme treasure, that's where you belong.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:31.280]   So Father, I ask that love would be awakened because of what you have done first.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.380]   We love you because you first loved us.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.080]   We praise you for that.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:45.360]   And as these friends discuss this massive issue of loving you and loving Christ, make
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   it happen.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.680]   I pray in Jesus name.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.680]   Amen.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.680]   Amen.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.600]   This next quote is from a video that was sent to us by Tim in Sunshine Coast, Australia.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.760]   That sounds like a beautiful place.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.520]   Tim writes, "Hello, Tony.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.240]   This clip is from John Piper's devotional that was transformational for me a few years
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.200]   ago and when I first came to truly understand how much I was loved by God and how I was
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.760]   saved despite my wretched past.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.960]   I had always understood if you love me, you will keep my commandments as doing good works
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.600]   to prove that I love God or which I had failed miserably up to then to do.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.320]   Oh, what a joy for me to discover that God had transformed my heart.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.000]   I love Jesus.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.560]   I long to do his commands.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   I'm saved.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.400]   I hope this is an encouragement to others as it has been to me.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   Amen.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.520]   Thank you, Tim.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.360]   And you can download that full book, What Jesus Demands from the World, John Piper's
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.720]   2006 book, What Jesus Demands from the World.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.080]   You can download it right now at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.920]   Thanks for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   Our clips are crowdsourced.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.040]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life and we share that clip with the
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.040]   APJ audience.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   If you've got one, email me.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.080]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.520]   the audio and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.000]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.880]   That's our email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.000]   So we know that one day Christ will return to earth to physically rule over the nations.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.240]   We long for that day when he rides on his white horse, his eyes like a flame of fire,
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.300]   clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and all in order to finally rule over the nations
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.240]   with a rod of iron.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.880]   That's what we were told to expect in Revelation 19.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.720]   But does Christ rule over the nations right now?
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.600]   And if so, how is that rule different from what it will be eventually?
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.280]   It's a great question.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.040]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John for that when we return on Friday.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.040]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.040]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.080]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   [END]
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   [END]
