[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.660]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.320]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.860]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.120]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.000]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.520]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.680]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.080]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.200]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.760]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.160]   But don't forget,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.600]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.080]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.000]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.880]   Well, listeners, Merry Christmas.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.860]   We are almost halfway through the month of December,
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.880]   and I know that your family
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.120]   is enjoying some time of Christmas celebration.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.720]   Maybe your homeschool has taken a brief hiatus
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.840]   and you are enjoying some more family time
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.080]   and freedom together.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.260]   I've got a suggestion for your family,
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.480]   for all of our families this Christmas.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480]   What if we intentionally spent time together
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.960]   doing the simplest things?
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.800]   What if we practice some simple habits
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.040]   designed to draw us to one another
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.920]   and to start meaningful conversations
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.160]   designed to provoke us to deeper thinking
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.960]   and to encourage us to true worship?
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.660]   What if in this season of busy,
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.440]   we celebrated Christmas by praying together,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.320]   playing together, reading together,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   exploring together and serving together.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.560]   This Advent season,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.680]   the everyday educator wants to practice these habits
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.160]   along with you.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.040]   So we're gonna talk to others who wanna try this plan too.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400]   So you can listen in every Tuesday
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.520]   to ponder the next verb.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   And today we're gonna be talking about read together.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.720]   And I have a dear friend and fellow family reader,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.320]   Tim Knotts with me today.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.160]   Tim, thank you so much for coming on Everyday Educator.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.360]   - I've been looking forward to it.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.620]   Thanks, Lisa.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.800]   - I love, Tim and I like to talk together.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.600]   So we're gonna try to keep this conversation
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.000]   in the middle of the road and stick to our topic,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.200]   which is really all about helping us as families
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.560]   simplify our Advent,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.360]   getting the most wonder and celebration
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.180]   out of the time that we spend together
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.180]   without getting caught up in the whirl of busyness
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.520]   and ought tos and shoulds and fear of missing out
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.360]   when we look at what everybody else is doing.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.640]   So, Tim, I wanna ask you first,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   what is it that you and your family love about Christmas?
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.960]   - We love lots of things.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.360]   And I wish that I could say that I had all those answers
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.560]   to those great conundrums that you just posed, Lisa.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.720]   - I know, right.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.520]   - We're trying to figure it all out too,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.800]   especially year by year as things change.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.760]   But we love, I mean, we love all sorts of things,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   the traditions, the flavors, the stories, the family time,
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.960]   even sort of the balance of busyness
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.000]   and then followed by a little bit of rest after the holiday.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.720]   It's all good in its own way.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.140]   - Yeah, that is really true and super encouraging
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.120]   because if we have families who are thinking,
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.200]   oh, well, I go overboard maybe.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.880]   Somebody might think I go overboard in the baking
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.600]   or overboard in the decorating and we like to be busy.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.760]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.560]   I think it's very wise reminder that you just gave us
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.880]   that it's okay to be busy and it's okay to rest
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.960]   and that perhaps the best way to celebrate
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.040]   is to find the balance there.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.520]   Let me ask you this.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.160]   I know that you guys are New Englanders.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.500]   So are you exuberant celebrators,
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.480]   quiet celebrators or somewhere in between?
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.120]   - I think we have a mix in our family.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.640]   Some of our children start celebrating Christmas
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.760]   anytime after the 4th of July.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.000]   (laughing)
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.380]   And they know that they kind of have to celebrate it
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.800]   a little under the radar.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.480]   And so there's some Christmas music listening that happens
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   when adults aren't around. (laughing)
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.140]   I think we sort of swing into the season
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.000]   more around the Thanksgiving time like many families,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.300]   some of us a little before and some of us a little after.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.140]   But we definitely enjoy decorating and all the festivities
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.820]   and like to do it a little longer
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.900]   than just maybe the week of Christmas.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.060]   - Gotcha, gotcha.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.060]   I know our family, we also have that mix.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.220]   We have that one child who refuses to entertain
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.900]   the notion of Christmas music until it's December.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.420]   And so you have to be very under the radar
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.300]   if you're in her presence.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.420]   And then I had friends that just mystified me
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.900]   because they waited until Christmas Eve
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.320]   to put up their Christmas tree.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.920]   And December 26, by lunchtime, it was going back.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.520]   Everything was taken down.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.780]   And that was a mystery to me
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.060]   because my family loves Christmas
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.040]   and we pretty much take the whole month of December
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.760]   and celebrate.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.700]   I'm sure that some people would feel that it was exuberant.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.300]   I tell people I'm gonna keep doing it this way
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.660]   as long as it keeps making us happy and we can do it.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.900]   So what are some of your favorite family traditions
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.860]   and how did they start?
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.940]   And I especially want to know which traditions
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.140]   were intentionally started by you and Cynthia
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.440]   and which were unintentionally repeated every year.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.420]   - Yeah, so we grew up with pretty different traditions
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.420]   between us in our birth families.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.900]   And it wasn't until probably our third child came along
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.460]   that we sat down and said,
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.500]   this sort of traveling back and forth
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.540]   and splitting time between grandparents every season,
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.420]   debating who's Thanksgiving it was
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.320]   and who's Christmas it was, kind of needed to stop.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.960]   And we decided that at that point,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.180]   we were going to have Christmas, at least as a rule,
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.300]   maybe not every single year,
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.300]   but as a general rule at our house.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.600]   And that any of our family members
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.940]   would be welcome to join us.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.100]   But with three and then four children,
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.880]   we said, it's time to make our own family traditions.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.420]   And so we did, and we didn't start with very many,
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.860]   but we did decide that, yeah,
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.480]   that the Christmas tree should go up
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.260]   sometime in that week or two after Thanksgiving.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.260]   And that we would have our Christmas present opening
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.100]   on Christmas morning,
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.700]   which is different than the way I grew up
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.560]   where we opened ours on Christmas Eve.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.940]   - My family too, when I was growing up.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.100]   Yeah, family presents for Christmas Eve.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.940]   - And so there were some sort of concessions
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.500]   back and forth about what we would do and how we do it.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.040]   And then some other ones though, they sprung up over time.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.940]   One Christmas, I saw a delicious sounding recipe
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.080]   for orange rolls.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.780]   So they're made like cinnamon rolls,
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.060]   but they're done with orange instead of cinnamon.
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.420]   And I made them and from then on the kids insisted
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.160]   that that was part of our Christmas tradition.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.340]   - Right, anything they love and you do once becomes a,
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.800]   well, we always do that.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.240]   - So I think a couple of years later,
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.880]   I mentioned maybe doing something different
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.100]   and they all protested that no,
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.680]   orange rolls have been part of our tradition
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.880]   from time immemorial, we must have these orange rolls.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.280]   So it is funny how some of them were choices
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.760]   and others were happenstance,
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.660]   but have become beloved parts
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.020]   of our family tradition anyway.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.860]   - I love that, I love that.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.940]   I think that kids love repetition
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.960]   and we see that in the way we teach our children classically,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.700]   but I think they love traditions.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.800]   And I know there were things that my girls,
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.380]   if it happened once and they really liked it,
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.680]   that they act like, well, of course,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.380]   we're always gonna do it that way.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.820]   We still have the same Christmas night meal
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.160]   that we had happenstance one time when they were little
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.020]   because it was really cold
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.420]   and I had the makings of chicken and dumplings.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.960]   And so it has become,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.240]   and of course we're having that on Christmas night, so.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.640]   - Well, it sounds like a delicious tradition.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.960]   - It's a very fun one and I do like them.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.480]   Do your kids love all your traditions
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.180]   or are there some that they just tolerate,
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.880]   especially as they grow into teenagers?
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.420]   - I think most of the traditions
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.180]   are ones that they're pretty okay with.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.720]   I think we've tried to not impose too many
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   that are onerous or too much of an investment
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:09.060]   so that they stay relatively fresh and content with those.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.500]   I mean, there are some that some love more than others.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.600]   I think many of them protest
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.440]   that we take down our Christmas tree around New Year's
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.780]   and they would love to see it stay up
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.240]   until it becomes a certain fire hazard
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.180]   instead of only a fire hazard.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:31.680]   So yeah, we definitely have some that are less popular,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.720]   but for the most part,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.100]   we try to keep the ones that are meaningful
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.700]   and not just ones that are traditions for tradition's sake.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.140]   - Yes, yes.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.960]   And finding the meaning in each of those traditions
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.040]   can sometimes help a family member
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.900]   who's not as partial to a tradition
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.120]   if they just know why you love it so much.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.180]   That sometimes will invest that tradition
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.480]   with a little more importance
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.120]   even for the one who didn't choose it.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.600]   Okay, I know we're gonna talk about how to simplify advent
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.400]   and with one of those scribblers verbs, read together.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.540]   And I know that you guys are a big
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:21.480]   read aloud together family all the times,
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.380]   not just during the holidays.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.380]   So what is it, Tim, that makes you and Cynthia
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.280]   so dedicated to reading aloud together?
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.020]   - Oh, there are a lot of reasons.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.760]   I think a few of the most important ones
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.960]   are sort of going from the most evident
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.900]   is that there's content in those books
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.420]   that's important that I want my children
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.460]   and my family to be aware of and to be reminded of.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.140]   So that's sort of dictates some of what we read.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.660]   There's a cultural context that comes about too.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.840]   Like as we read books from different times and eras
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.500]   that talk about different things.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.940]   But a lot of them are because they're good opportunities
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.060]   for conversation when you run into a conflict
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.820]   or you run into a feeling in a book
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.240]   that you want to talk about
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.500]   because children need to learn sometimes
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.380]   how to talk about their feelings
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.200]   or how to talk about their experiences
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.620]   and to do it in the context of a book
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.860]   instead of in their quote unquote real life
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.520]   is a safer place to do that.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.020]   - Yep, yeah, it is a great way
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.820]   to develop a moral imagination
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.700]   and to deal with, as you said,
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.260]   subjects that maybe hopefully our children
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.680]   will never experience firsthand
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.560]   but that they need to know how to deal with
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.360]   or think about, contemplate, be prepared to address
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.020]   should it ever arise.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.520]   Yeah, that's really good.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.180]   - The last reason that I'll share
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.320]   is that we think it's really important
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.700]   that they understand the importance of reading good books
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.980]   and that we show that to them
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.500]   by not just telling them about it
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.580]   or letting them see us do it
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.140]   but by doing it together with them.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.580]   - Yeah, it shows them that it's important enough
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.540]   for you guys to spend family time on.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.100]   That's how important it is.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.100]   Does reading together affect your family's mood?
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.300]   - It can.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.100]   I don't think it's a panacea, right?
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.100]   It doesn't solve every problem.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.820]   There are times when I just am totally invested
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.740]   and want to sit down and snuggle up and read with my kids
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.240]   and they're not feeling it.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.240]   And that can create some conflict sometimes
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.540]   where we have to sort out what's going on
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.820]   and why aren't they interested in this right now.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.380]   And sometimes it's a good check on my heart
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.020]   'cause I can get frustrated and feel like,
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.500]   hey, I've set aside this time out of my busy schedule,
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.920]   you can at least make some moments for me.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:27.820]   But overall, I would say once we do get to it,
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.860]   it is such a good resetting.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.060]   It's a good opportunity for us to all be quiet
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.940]   and to be together, to laugh together sometimes
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.940]   or to wrestle a little bit with a passage or an idea.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.220]   And sometimes they're excited to keep reading
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.660]   and sometimes they're ready to be done.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.660]   And I think gauging that mood as a parent is important.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.820]   And it's a good practice for me,
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.140]   especially since I'm not the primary homeschooling parent,
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.220]   my wife is.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.580]   And so for me to be engaged with my kids like that
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.940]   in at least a semi-academic setting helps me make sure
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.180]   that I keep a pulse on where they're at and where they're at.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.460]   It helps me make sure that I keep a pulse on where they are
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.220]   and that I'm being attentive to their needs.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.980]   - Right, and you get to see how they're growing
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.500]   and their ability to consider big questions
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.660]   or how they're processing or what's interesting to them.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.140]   That's a really good, good point, Tim.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.860]   It keeps families kind of on the same page,
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.820]   knowing each other.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.700]   I know I'm very familiar with what you're describing
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.060]   that sometimes the kids are just not as interested
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.980]   in investing in that family read-aloud time
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.740]   as we are for whatever reason.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.640]   I mean, who knows why sometimes.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.420]   But I agree with you that it's a good reset time.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.620]   And it does draw our hearts together.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.620]   It does give us shared memories and a shared investment
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:09.340]   in a story or a hymn or a passage of scripture,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.260]   whatever we're reading, we've got a shared investment
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:18.260]   in the group thoughts that developed as we read.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.020]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.440]   - You're right on that there's that sort of unifying thing
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.220]   that happens as we're all thinking
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.320]   some of the same thoughts after an author.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.220]   And I love that idea of the fact that it doesn't have to be
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.220]   you're pulling out a novel or Russian history or something,
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.300]   that it can be a lovely little book of poems
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.300]   or a contemplation of scripture or hymns.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.160]   - Yeah, yeah, I like that.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.080]   I really like that.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.700]   Is it hard for y'all to make time to read together
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.040]   during the holidays?
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.840]   Do you ever feel like you're just too busy
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.780]   to sit down and do that?
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.200]   - Not just the holidays.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.040]   (laughing)
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.200]   - All the time.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.340]   - Yeah, I mean, it is.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.260]   It's always a struggle to find that set aside time.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.260]   I tend to try to do it around a meal time in our family
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.620]   because we are together.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.320]   It doesn't always work.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.540]   Sometimes there's too much.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.460]   Sometimes it's just bad timing.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.400]   Sometimes they're not in a place to give it their attention
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.060]   and we have to find another time.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   But trying to find that regularity of this is a time
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.620]   when we do this sort of thing.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.960]   And like we talked about earlier,
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.820]   kids like to know what the pattern is.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.580]   And so if they know that the pattern is,
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.780]   we spend some read aloud time, maybe not every day,
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.780]   but our typical read aloud time is around the meal
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.780]   when we're all at the table anyway.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.340]   - Right, you just expect to stay a little longer.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.780]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.700]   - I know when our girls were really little,
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.660]   we had a read aloud time ranged around sleeping time.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.700]   So like right before nap time and right before bedtime.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.620]   And as they got older, there were no more nap times
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.200]   and everybody's bedtime was different.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.440]   And so I know that we did some,
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:25.260]   we did some times where we would read on Sunday afternoons
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.340]   or Sunday evenings by default,
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.340]   kind of as a way to start head into the week together
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.340]   on the same page.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.540]   So I think you just have to find what works for your family.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.880]   - Our church has been meeting in the afternoons
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.100]   because of some facility issues.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.100]   And so Sunday mornings are a really nice time
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:49.940]   for us to have some family time.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.820]   - Oh, that's a sweet time, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.140]   So how do you think, think with me a little bit about this
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.320]   'cause I've been trying to think of ways to help families
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   simplify their Advent routines,
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.200]   but deepen their joyful expression of the holiday.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.460]   So how might reading together simplify the celebration
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:18.320]   of Advent while deepening our joy?
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.300]   - Yeah, I mean, it's an easy time of year
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.300]   to have your attentions and even your affections
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.620]   drawn in so many different directions.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:35.780]   Gift giving and shopping is a beautiful thing,
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.660]   but it can take over your life
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.200]   when you're spending all your hours,
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.260]   either at the store or cruising around the Amazon website.
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:49.660]   And the decorating of the house is also a good thing,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.680]   but when it's, and now it's this window
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.800]   and now it's the Christmas tree and now it's the front yard
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.240]   and it can just all take over.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.440]   And while there's parts that give joy,
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.200]   there's also things that can eventually steal joy.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:13.140]   So I think having that time and being intentional
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.780]   about what are your readings,
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.000]   what are you gonna be doing together
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.420]   can help define that center again as a family
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.060]   to help you at least daily
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.980]   or as often as you're able to do it
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.620]   to come together around the thing that's the center
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.520]   and not all the other stuff that's good,
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.640]   but not the middle.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.660]   Even those traditions we talked about earlier,
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.660]   they're good, but if you lose sight of Advent and Christmas
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.300]   because of all the family traditions,
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:55.100]   then they've sort of taken a bad place
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.700]   even if they're a good thing.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   - Yeah, yes, yes, that's exactly it, that's exactly it.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.620]   So many of our traditions are fun
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.900]   and there's nothing wrong with them.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.540]   But if we get so frenzied in the production
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.060]   that we don't enjoy the activity
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.500]   or don't enjoy the company,
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.940]   the people that we're doing it with,
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.380]   we've lost some of the reason for doing it
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.660]   and it's not helping us to celebrate anymore.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.900]   So what kinds of things do you guys read together?
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:36.320]   And I mean, you can tell us generally,
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.720]   but also are there certain things
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.000]   that you read aloud every year together?
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   - Mm-hmm, so I mean, I tend to read stories to my kids,
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.720]   whether they're in the form of a novel
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.860]   or short stories or children's books,
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.160]   that's where I focus a lot of my reading
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.680]   in the read aloud sense.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.640]   Cynthia reads them different things,
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.360]   so they get a variety from the two of us.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.640]   But this time of year, we definitely try to pick out
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.260]   like a devotional guide that works our way
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.960]   through Advent ideas so that we don't,
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   so we make sure that we're covering all the main ideas
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.360]   and that we're not focusing too much on one thing
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.420]   and leaving out other things
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.020]   that we should be talking about.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.980]   And so sometimes those sort of daily Advent guides
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.320]   can be a help, but it's also though important
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.080]   not to feel like they're the master
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.100]   and you're the servant and you have to,
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.280]   like, hey kids, we have to do this.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.800]   Rain or something, whether we got the time or not,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.760]   we're gonna grind it out.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.920]   So there is even in that finding that balance
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.760]   of sometimes we just touch on it
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.640]   and we don't read the whole thing for a day
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.520]   or we miss a day and we have to do a little catch up
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.680]   and being flexible with ourselves
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.520]   and with our family life this time of year is also important.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.620]   - I know that there are times when,
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.460]   'cause we've done that too, Advent devotional things.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.720]   And then there's some days that just don't,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.520]   I mean, they kind of left my kids cold.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.580]   They didn't really have anything to put into it.
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.160]   It didn't strike a specific chord with them.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.980]   And then there were days when for some reason,
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.540]   they found deep application
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.500]   from that particular day's reading.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.620]   And so we spent tons more time than we did the day before.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.120]   And I think we have to be prepared for that as parents
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.720]   that everything won't resonate with everybody every year.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.420]   - Yeah.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.320]   So there are things,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.440]   apart from trying to pick a devotional guide,
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.480]   there are other things that we also bring back
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.220]   year after year.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.000]   I wouldn't say that all of them are in every year thing
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.380]   'cause there are some years
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.720]   that some of them get a bit crowded out.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:17.240]   But we try, I always read them, Charles Dickens,
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.260]   the Christmas Carol, either the full version,
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.540]   which is pretty lengthy for a seasonal read aloud.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.420]   And especially for littler kids.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.460]   But he actually wrote his own abridged version
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.940]   for public readings.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.060]   - Oh, you know what, I don't think I have that.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.040]   - And so that's a great choice
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.540]   because it is just enough shorter
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:45.540]   that it's a little more manageable for younger kids
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.160]   or for a busier family to read.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.280]   I always read them, Oh Henry's Gift of the Magi.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.960]   And we always read The Best Christmas Pageant Ever.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.220]   Those are sort of our books
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.700]   that come around year after year.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.620]   There's poetry and hymns.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.980]   Of course, scripture, the scriptural stories
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.640]   are central to what we encounter.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.620]   Often repetitively, right?
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.060]   And that's okay.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.020]   That they hear those verses, that they hear those stories
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.900]   more than one time in a season
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.980]   is actually a really good thing.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.720]   - Yeah, I can remember.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.500]   I can remember when I was growing up,
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.020]   and this will probably date me,
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.220]   the Charlie Brown Christmas Special was fairly new.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.020]   I mean, it hadn't been around forever, like it has now.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.460]   And I loved it, it was my favorite one.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.940]   And I can remember the year I suddenly discovered
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.520]   that I could recite that Luke 2 passage
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.420]   that Linus recites in the cartoon special.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.800]   And so I can, to this day when I read it aloud,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.520]   I can sort of hear Linus's sweet little voice
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.900]   reading it in my head.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.760]   But I think that anything that our children hear
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.340]   over and over when they're really young
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.880]   makes a great impression on them.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.400]   And so, yeah, I agree with you.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   There are things that we want to read
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.800]   more than once a season,
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.620]   because we want it to take root in our children's hearts.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:35.840]   So if somebody asks you,
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:43.940]   I want you, Tim, to help me design a reading program
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.380]   for celebrating Christmas deeply yet simply,
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.100]   what would you suggest?
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.720]   You mentioned the things that you guys read every year,
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   A Christmas Carol, why do you read that every year?
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:05.640]   - Well, Dickens, his writing there shapes so much
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   of how we think about Christmas as Western Christians.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.100]   Since he wrote it, it's been so,
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:21.980]   so much has changed because of his writing
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.960]   in the way that we think about Christmas.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.620]   So I think it's important historically.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:31.080]   And again, it gives such a good avenue
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   for some good conversation about past and present and future
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:43.360]   and what does it mean to be a good person,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.120]   which is a good conversation to have,
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.340]   even though that itself is not gospel.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.660]   - Hopefully then opens the further door
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.660]   to the conversation about, is that good enough?
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.500]   Right, is being a good person good enough?
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.120]   - Yes.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   - Is Scrooge saved at the end or is he just improved?
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.180]   - Oh my goodness, yes.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.720]   See, those are the kind of deep conversations
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.780]   that people don't always see coming
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.320]   when they read a story or a novel.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.300]   And maybe they don't think about the fact
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.440]   that that's a conversation you could have with your child
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.620]   that would make them stop and think.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.080]   And you come to it, like you said earlier, Tim,
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.240]   through the experience of a character.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.720]   So you're not finger-pointing at somebody they know,
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.200]   somebody in their family or in their neighborhood
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.400]   or in their church, but you're helping them
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.480]   to consider larger questions because they came up
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.000]   in the life of a character in a read-aloud.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.400]   - Right, or like I said, we read O. Henry's
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.500]   Gift of the Magi, and in that one,
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   you have the chance to talk about the cost of a gift.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:02.480]   And obviously, this time of year, our kids think about that
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:08.040]   as they decide how much of their little savings
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.320]   they want to spend on giving gifts.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   And it's, again, a beautiful open door
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.680]   for talking about the gospel
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.160]   and what did it cost God to send Jesus.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.400]   And that that's a free gift for us to receive,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.100]   but it wasn't a free gift for him to give.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.080]   - Yes, yes.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:38.080]   And that's the kind of simple but deep celebrations
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:43.960]   I think a lot of us long to have as a family.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.600]   So if someone were to ask me where to start
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.520]   because not everybody's gonna dive in with Dickens
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   or even a devotional guide because some of those are good
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.660]   and some of them are not so good
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.040]   and they take some investment to follow along with them,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.000]   I would say start with the scriptures,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.480]   start with the real source material.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.240]   You know, those first few chapters of Matthew
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.760]   and Luke and John are so full of wonderful things
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   to talk about that that's a great place.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.280]   I mean, even if you just read them a couple of times
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.280]   through your week and cement that as part,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.880]   like you said, of hearing Linus in their head,
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.080]   but hopefully it's not Linus,
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.200]   hopefully it's their parents' voice
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.040]   that they hear reading those stories.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.200]   And with some older kids,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.920]   I think it would be really fun to approach those
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.800]   and look at your little cross-reference notes in your Bible
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.440]   and then go have a scavenger hunt in the Old Testament
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.920]   for places where it talks about the coming of Jesus
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.580]   and look at those prophecies.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.400]   You don't need a devotional guide to read your Bible
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.360]   and to get into helping our students understand that.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:09.600]   And then adding a Christmas carol or two,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.800]   and especially some of the ones
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   that they might not be so familiar with,
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.760]   I love, love, love, love those old, old hymns
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:22.000]   that we only ever sing around this time of year
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.720]   and some of our churches never sing,
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.520]   like, "Of the Father's love begotten,"
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.720]   or, "Let all mortal flesh keep silence,"
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.520]   or, "Now who was to rich beyond all splendor?"
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.920]   These beautiful old hymns that have glorious words
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.760]   and think deeply on the incarnation
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.080]   and picking apart one of those and listening to it
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   over and over makes it part of a Christmas tradition
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:56.160]   and makes us, as well as our children, better thinkers
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.120]   about the ideas of Christmas
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.880]   instead of just the traditions of Christmas.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.720]   - I love that, Tim, I really do.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.360]   I know, I love Christmas music,
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.880]   Christmas music, even the same old, same old hymns
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.400]   that we always sing at church for Christmas.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.560]   But I remember as a teenager,
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.240]   because I had always loved the hymns before,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.640]   I remember one Sunday as a teenager
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.680]   when I was preoccupied with something
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.280]   that was going on in my family
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.720]   and I realized this thing that I'd always loved,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.600]   I was just on autopilot
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.720]   and I wasn't thinking about the words at all.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.560]   I was missing, and it came to me, I am missing it.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.280]   I am missing what's important about this.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.200]   I'm not thinking about the words.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.640]   I'm not letting the words draw my spirit to the Lord's.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.560]   And ever since then, it has been important to me
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.440]   to think about the words.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.800]   And sometimes I will, in my devotions,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.320]   just read Christmas hymns
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.160]   and it can be very profoundly moving
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.640]   when you're not just moving your mouth to the tune
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.000]   that you're really thinking about the words.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.360]   I like that suggestion.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.240]   - Yeah, and some other ways to sort of expand
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.360]   from that core of scripture itself.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:35.080]   The Hallelujah Guide, which is written by Cindy Rollins,
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.000]   is a lovely devotional.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.320]   It looks at the Advent season
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.400]   through the lens of Handel's Messiah.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   And so I would commend the guide to you.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.320]   It's a good one for sort of wrapping in some stories
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.440]   and some poetry and some hymns,
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.440]   along with the part looking at the great master work
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.000]   by Handel.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.160]   But even that, putting that music on,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.840]   because its words are nothing but scripture.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.200]   And it's a beautiful thing to meditate on
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.200]   and to fill your home with a beautiful music as well.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.120]   - Yeah, yeah, I can remember.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.080]   David and I used to love,
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.640]   we used to go to a live performance of Messiah every year
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.160]   when we were in college
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.120]   and when we would come back home to visit that area.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.120]   And so we loved it, and we found a young Messiah recording
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:39.720]   that we enjoyed, and we played it for the girls.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   And so they grew up thinking of that as Christmas music.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:50.040]   And the funniest thing to me was when my grandson,
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.760]   who's now almost 18 months old, was really little.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.640]   I was at my daughter and son-in-law's home one day
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.920]   and Gideon was just all upset.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.920]   And so my daughter said, "Well, play his calming music,
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.480]   go turn on the calming music, turn on the calming music."
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.240]   And it was Messiah.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   And I said, "Oh my gosh, you're playing Messiah
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.720]   for this baby?"
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.480]   And my daughter said, "You know what?
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.160]   It's the only thing that calms him down."
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.040]   And so music can speak to the heart
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.080]   of our very youngest family members.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.360]   And so I really like that suggestion.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.360]   It resonates with me, Tim.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.560]   - Yeah, and then the last thing I would add is
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:42.440]   as you're doing some of those school activities, right?
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.800]   The academic stuff,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.480]   finding some ways to incorporate those hymns and music,
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   even there, some of our old friends in Christmas hymns
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.040]   come from Latin texts.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.400]   So you get, "O come, O come, Emmanuel," right?
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.120]   Is, "O come, O come, Emmanuel,"
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.000]   or, "O come, all ye faithful," right?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.920]   "Adeste Fidelis."
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.400]   You can take those and do some exercises,
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.840]   some Latin work, but do it in a way
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.920]   that's going to bless your thinking as well, right?
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.120]   You're thinking about the season
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.200]   and not just your ability to do some translation.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.240]   I love it.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.680]   I love it.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.520]   Tie your work to your faith and your celebration.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.560]   That makes all of it better.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.680]   - We're doing that just the other morning
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.240]   with, "O come, O come, Emmanuel,"
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.040]   looking at the chorus, right?
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.400]   That in English says, "Rejoice, rejoice."
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.760]   "Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel," right?
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.640]   But in Latin, it's, "Gaudae, Gaudae."
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.000]   And then the word for, "will come," in English,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.280]   is actually, "nascetur,"
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   which is a passive voice for being born, right?
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.720]   So it's echoing that great verse, right?
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.640]   That, "For unto us a child is born."
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.120]   And so you can make these lovely connections
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.600]   and it doesn't have to be a big production.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.480]   You don't have to have lots of guides.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.360]   Sometimes it's just looking at the words themselves
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.720]   and wondering at the marvelous things that God has done.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.080]   - Oh, that's beautiful.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:27.920]   I'm gonna go.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.000]   I'm gonna go and look that up myself.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.680]   I think that's what David and I will be doing
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.800]   at suppertime tonight.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.480]   That's a great suggestion.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.120]   Okay, last question for you, Tim, before we go.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.000]   If you asked your kids,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.840]   what would their favorite read-alouds be at Christmas time?
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.160]   - Well, they really do love
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.440]   when we read the best Christmas pageant ever.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.400]   That's definitely near the top of their lists.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.040]   The Night Before Christmas, the poem,
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.320]   my parents recorded for them
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.920]   one of those audio recordable books of it.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.520]   And so that comes out every Christmas time
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.280]   and they listen to it over and over.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.160]   And yes, like you with Linus,
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.320]   they've memorized significant sections of it
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.160]   without even knowing they were memorizing it.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.200]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.920]   - And then the one that they'll also sometimes ask about
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.400]   is that one that makes Papa cry,
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.880]   which is the gift of the Magi.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.160]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.600]   Oh, and see, it'll make them cry
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.480]   when they are a Papa themselves, okay.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.320]   That's great.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.440]   Well, Tim, thank you so much for sharing
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.180]   just a little bit about your family's experience
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.240]   with reading aloud and helping our listeners
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.720]   brainstorm some ways to simplify Advent
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.320]   by reading together.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.200]   I appreciate your time.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.320]   And listeners, I appreciate you being with us
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.040]   on this journey of simplifying Advent this year.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.120]   I have one thing I wanna tell you about
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.920]   that I don't know if you are taking a trip,
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.240]   if you're taking any trips for Christmas break this year,
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.480]   if any of you are gonna be in DC,
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.280]   I wanna suggest that you stop off
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.780]   at the Museum of the Bible.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.780]   It's got a lot of interactive, immersive exhibits there.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.280]   You can get the history of the scriptures.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.640]   But this year, the museum is putting on,
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.520]   it's called Gloria Wonders of Noel.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.560]   It's a series of Christmas-themed events
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.440]   that will really inspire your family.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.600]   It's very joyful.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.360]   It will show you the historical significance
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.860]   of the birth of Jesus.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.200]   There are some daily readings about the Christmas story.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.080]   There's some choral performances.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.440]   There's crafts.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.900]   There's all kinds of stuff going on.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:02.000]   There are even some Christmas-exclusive exhibits.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.320]   I think one of them is called Bethlehem Reborn.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.260]   So if you're a CC member,
