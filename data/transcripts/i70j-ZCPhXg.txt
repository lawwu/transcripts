[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.360]   - Okay, today I'm speaking
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.520]   with my good friend, Brian Kaplan,
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.800]   and this will actually be the second time we talk.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.320]   This is the first time we talked
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.240]   was the first episode of this podcast.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.860]   So yeah, I'm really excited about this.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.560]   - Or it's fantastic to be back here to Rakesh.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.600]   Great to see how well you've been doing for yourself.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.400]   And now it is my privilege to get to speak to you.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.320]   - Excellent, okay.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.360]   So today we're talking about your book,
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.400]   "Labor Econ Versus the World."
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.680]   And it's a collection of your essays throughout the years,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.120]   and I highly recommend it.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.480]   Okay, so here's my first question.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.160]   What percentage of the working age population
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.480]   is zero or negative productivity?
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.960]   - It's a good question.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.480]   So this is working age population, not actual,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.800]   not the ones that are in fact currently working.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.120]   - Yeah, hmm.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.040]   Let's see.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.040]   Well, I'd be inclined to say probably something like 3%.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.000]   Although of course, it's much higher
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.120]   if you just make someone do a job
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.680]   that they're not suited for.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.840]   So again, whenever people talk
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.080]   about zero productivity workers,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.400]   I often want to say,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.840]   the fact that someone is zero productivity
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480]   or negative productivity at the job they're doing
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.480]   doesn't show that they are
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.440]   a zero or negative productivity person.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.120]   Could just be that they are mismatched to the job.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.200]   A common misunderstanding actually.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.000]   So yeah, I think it is very low
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.120]   for the working age population for any job at all.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.440]   One of the things that labor markets do of course,
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.880]   is fire you from jobs where you have
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.240]   really low productivity,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.400]   which encourages you to search around
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.360]   for something where you are actually productive.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.280]   - So then what's the explanation
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.960]   for why labor force participation is like 60% or something?
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.640]   So there's like a gap of about like the 37% or something
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.520]   of people who could be contributing, but are not.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.040]   - Well, I mean, the biggest explanation
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   is working moms, or not working moms,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.960]   rather moms especially of young kids
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.200]   who don't want a job
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.880]   because they are busy taking care of their kids.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.960]   So I say that is the first and foremost one
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.200]   is family responsibilities.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.760]   There's a small share of people that are rich enough
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.360]   and there isn't any job that they like doing.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.360]   So I think that's only maybe a couple percent
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.720]   of the population.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   Then you've got a larger percentage of the population
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.040]   where government redistribution means
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.960]   that they really don't have that much of a gain
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.640]   from working, at least in the short run.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.520]   And so I think often it would still in fact
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.160]   be better for them in the long run just to get a job,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.840]   even if they don't make as much money
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.560]   when they're receiving redistribution
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.120]   because you get training and connections.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.840]   So in the long run, it is a better strategy.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.760]   There's another chunk of people whose parents
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.600]   are just either really nice or suckers,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.720]   depending upon how you see it,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.160]   who will just take care of them.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.760]   There's of course spouses, even when you don't have kids
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.560]   or romantic partners who will take care of you
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.920]   even though you are not working, right?
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.400]   And then finally, well, this is not,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.880]   oh, this category does overlap with the others,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.480]   but then there are guys who just really don't want to go
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.760]   and conform.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.280]   Most often what they're doing is they work sporadically
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.960]   and they have a job and then they are difficult
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.880]   and they get fired and then they are unemployed for a while
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   and then they find another job.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.560]   Yeah, so like there's one of my favorite books on poverty,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.880]   which is "Promises I Can Keep"
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.800]   talks about the problems of single moms.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.480]   And one of the main things that it talks about
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.680]   is they're not happy with the fathers of their kids.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680]   And then the question comes up,
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   what was the problem, they can't find jobs?
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.680]   And it's a no, no, no, he finds jobs all the time.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.640]   Problems keeping jobs.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.400]   So I think that's another part of it.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.480]   So of course, if you officially say
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.440]   that you're still looking for work,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.760]   but you just don't find a job,
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.840]   then you'll be counted as unemployed.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.320]   But if sometimes you just say, screw it,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.160]   I'm not even looking.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.960]   And then they record that in the stats,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.360]   then that will come out as saying
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.320]   that you aren't even trying, so.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.440]   - Yeah, so I'm glad you brought up poverty.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.760]   So you emphasize in the book, the success sequence.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.480]   So this is the idea that if you get married,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.880]   if you have kids, you get a high school diploma
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.480]   and you work full-time,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.080]   then you're virtually guaranteed to not be in poverty.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.920]   So now this raises a question-
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.440]   - In the United States anyway.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.960]   - Oh, sorry, yeah, in the United States.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.280]   So this raises a question,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.880]   if it's so easy to stay out of poverty
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.040]   or to not get into poverty in the first place,
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.760]   and if so many people are still avoiding doing these steps,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.880]   like what is the explanation?
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.280]   'Cause clearly being out of poverty
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   is like something that a lot of people,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.760]   you would think they would want.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.680]   So are these steps harder than we think?
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.640]   Like, what is the explanation
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.360]   for why so many people are still failing
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.240]   to comply by these basic steps?
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.560]   - That's a great question.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.120]   So when people ask me about the meaning
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.600]   of the success sequence, I say,
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.200]   well, look, imagine there's some research saying
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.840]   that here's a simple recipe to avoid poverty.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.160]   First, be first in your class at MIT.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.320]   Second of all, win a Nobel Prize.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.720]   And third, marry someone who won an Academy Award.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.680]   If that was the prescription,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.960]   then people might reasonably say,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   well, hardly anybody can do that,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.440]   so I'm not even gonna try, that's ridiculous, it's hopeless.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.560]   And then if that's what you have to do to avoid poverty,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.600]   then you could reasonably say,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.080]   well, most people just couldn't possibly do it.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.880]   What's interesting about the success sequence
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.280]   is that it does sound quite easy, right?
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.160]   So American high school standards are very low.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.960]   Basically, if you just show up and try,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.680]   then you're very likely to get passed along,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.800]   so you'll graduate from high school.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.560]   Getting a job for working full-time.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.480]   Even when you go and ask people who are in poverty
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.080]   during all but very severe recessions,
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.960]   normally they'll say, yeah, it's easy to get a job.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.440]   It's not actually very hard.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.280]   This is, again, talking to actual poor people.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.960]   This is not just the opinion of economics professors.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   And then finally, waiting until marriage to have kids.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.600]   That sounds really easy.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.520]   It's like, well, hmm, yeah,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.800]   we've got reliable contraception.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.480]   It's not like you need celibacy or anything.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.560]   Just delay until you've got someone
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.640]   that you are comfortable raising the kids with.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.280]   So as to why these three things,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.080]   why people don't do them,
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.800]   well, there's a few possibilities.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.640]   So one is that people just don't know, right?
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.880]   I'd say this is really hard not to know
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.080]   because you have so many people.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.040]   First of all, you have a lot of people telling you.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.920]   Your parents are telling you, teachers are telling you,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.880]   other authorities are telling you, coaches are telling you.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   Furthermore, it is totally normal even in neighborhoods
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.920]   where people are not following this
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.000]   for parents to want you to follow it,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.560]   which I think is a telling piece of information
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.040]   because there is a critique saying
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.520]   that this success sequence only works for people
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.160]   that are growing up in a middle-class neighborhood.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.200]   And it is just not realistic for,
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.560]   it is not actually a path to out of poverty for other people.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.520]   If that's so, why is it that parents who themselves
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.600]   have not followed it push it so hard?
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.280]   Which, again, it appears to be totally normal.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.760]   It is really weird for a single mom to raise their kids
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.880]   saying, you know what I want you to be?
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.760]   A single mom.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.200]   It's the best, it's the only good path in life.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.120]   Right, that's not normal.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.040]   Instead, the normal thing is to say,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.280]   look at how I messed up my life, don't do what I did, wait.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.760]   Right, and then people still don't wait.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.920]   There's also a story saying, well, look,
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.720]   even though people are telling you to do this,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.120]   you don't have any good examples
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.920]   that you can, where you can see that anyone's followed it,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.440]   so there isn't really any real proof.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.720]   And here I say, hmm,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.480]   well, probably your teachers in school follow it.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.760]   So you can look at them and you can say,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.560]   all right, my teacher might not be the coolest person,
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.040]   but they're not living in poverty.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.640]   Right, bare minimum.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.320]   Right, so my teacher seems to have a path out of this.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.000]   Furthermore, it's actually very normal,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.080]   even in poor families,
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.800]   for there to be successful members of the family
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.560]   who have escaped poverty and normally do it
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.120]   by following the success sequence.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.960]   So you'll have a relative who's in a family of single moms,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.680]   but this is the one that didn't do it.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.920]   And this is the one that waited and followed the path.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.600]   And you will see her at family events.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.840]   People may have some resentment,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.960]   oh, she thinks she's so much better than the rest of us,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.760]   but you can't say that they don't have
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.680]   any first-hand experience with it, they've got that.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.560]   So I think the story that makes the most sense to me
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.320]   is it does require some impulse control, right,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.760]   which is not fun for people.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.200]   Right now, so yeah, finishing high school,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.480]   you have requires that you go and sit there and be bored.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.280]   I remember high school, it was really boring.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.360]   So I could, and especially when you've got young people
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.560]   that are making the decisions,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.440]   young people are famous for low impulse control.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.720]   Same thing for working a job.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.000]   A lot of what you're doing on a job
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.160]   is humiliating yourself, honestly.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.720]   Right, there's a customer who's mistreating you
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.920]   and yelling you, you're being rude for no good reason.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.400]   Like to keep the job, then you say,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.080]   yes, sir, terribly sorry, sir.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.360]   Your pride says to say, hey, don't talk to me that way.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.480]   Like, what do you know?
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.680]   You're the one that screwed up.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.360]   But you're not supposed to say that on a job
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.400]   and it requires impulse control to keep your mouth shut.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.520]   And then of course, most notoriously,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.400]   avoiding kids that you're not ready to have
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.680]   requires impulse control.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.760]   Right, and indeed, I would say that in all the work
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.600]   on poverty that I've read,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.760]   I would say that poor sexual impulse control
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.720]   is actually the root of almost all the other problems
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.000]   because it's one where a lapse in judgment
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.960]   actually leads to long-term responsibilities.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.000]   In a way, you know, so you can recover
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.560]   from yelling at a customer and getting fired.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   All right, fine.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.400]   You burn some bridges,
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.200]   but you just look around, you get another job.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.040]   But you really can't easily recover for,
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.000]   especially if you're the mom from having a child
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.200]   where the dad isn't gonna help you
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.640]   or the other parents can help you.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.440]   It does mean that for 18 years,
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.920]   you really are trying to at best juggle
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   a lot of complicated responsibilities.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.720]   Right, right.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.560]   And so I guess most crucially,
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   I feel like one of the main critiques of the success sequence
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.280]   by the way, is that full-time work
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.960]   does almost all the work.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.360]   Now, my understanding from Bad Wilcox, that's not true.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.880]   And there actually is a marginal effect
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.320]   of the other pieces besides full-time work.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.680]   But even if the full-time work critique
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.520]   were totally correct, the question is,
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.880]   well, how easy is it for a single mom to do full-time work?
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.160]   And yeah, it's really hard, right?
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.920]   Now, as to why people do it despite the fact
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.080]   it's like just a minor impulse control
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   and then you'll have a much better life.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.560]   I mean, the answer for that is like,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.480]   well, hmm, hard to say.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.560]   I mean, I would just, if the person were asking for advice,
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.480]   I would say, look, this is really easy, do it.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.440]   And they don't do it anyway.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.080]   And I said, man, it was so easy and you still didn't do it.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.520]   Well, you're like, I told you what to do.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.120]   Why didn't you listen to me?
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.840]   And there's the classic response
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.360]   of the irresponsible young person.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   Like, why did you do it?
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.560]   I don't know, I don't know.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.920]   And it's one that's timeless
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.720]   where a young person does something
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.800]   where it seems like it was really easy to do
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.640]   the wise thing.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.800]   They were told what the wise thing was.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.440]   They didn't do it anyway.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.960]   And what more can you say at that point
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.360]   other than, gee, you've really messed up
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.800]   and you're no longer a child
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.840]   and you're now gonna be paying for this for a long time.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.680]   Sorry.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.920]   - Yeah, so there's Charles Murray's story in "Coming Apart"
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.800]   which is that actually the culture
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.920]   isn't emphasizing these values,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.000]   or at least like the elites in the culture
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.040]   are not emphasizing these values that they live by, right?
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.240]   So in that way you can say like,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.960]   oh, it's like, it's the elite's fault
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.360]   for not emphasizing these values
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.640]   that these people don't know about anyways.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.760]   Or I'm sure you saw Tyler's review of your book
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.040]   on "Marginal Revolution" where he said about this.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.600]   I mean, he was broadly praising your book,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.120]   but he said about this point that,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.600]   oh, you're underestimating like the cultural factors
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.120]   that might get in the way of somebody
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.680]   achieving the success sequence.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.760]   Yeah, so I wonder what your reactions are to those.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.520]   - Yeah, so Charles Murray, I would say,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.160]   look, there's probably a little truth to this,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.200]   but it's a pretty damn lame excuse.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.920]   You say, yeah, well, gee, why did you go
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.240]   and drop out of high school and fail to get a job
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.600]   and then have kids before you got married?
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.120]   Well, the elites didn't tell me
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.840]   that I should do these things.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.360]   Like, look, there's a lot of people
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.680]   telling you to do this stuff.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.640]   Teachers are not at the highest level of elite,
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.720]   but relative to a poor community, teachers are elite.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.760]   You got parents, you got ministers.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.240]   In a poor community, a minister,
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.480]   well, what's the minister telling you?
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.360]   Is he telling you to not do the success sequence?
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.280]   No, he's telling you to do the success sequence.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.800]   He might also be adding that this is an evil racist society
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.160]   that's screwing you over.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.840]   But if anything, that's a reason to go
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.560]   and be careful with your behavior
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.520]   so that the racist society has more trouble
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.560]   screwing you over to say, look,
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.880]   I don't have a lot of second chances,
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.800]   so I better watch my behavior and be mindful.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.360]   Now, I mean, I think it is fair to say,
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.960]   look, elites could do a bit more, but again, to say,
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.880]   well, I wanted to do all these things,
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.600]   but the elites just didn't tell me, so blame them.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.720]   It's a pretty lame excuse.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.400]   It's about at the level of saying that you went
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.080]   and put your hand in a blender
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.960]   'cause you saw it on a cartoon.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   It's like, come on.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.600]   I mean, if you're 10, then tell the parents,
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.080]   hey, well, don't let the kid watch cartoons
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.160]   if they're just going to copy
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.480]   whatever horrible thing they see Bugs Bunny doing.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.520]   But if they are at the level where they know
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.960]   the difference between cartoons and reality,
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.960]   then it's like, hey, exercise some responsibility there.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.720]   Right, and again, for Tyler saying
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.000]   I'm neglecting cultural factors,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.240]   I do talk a lot about cultural factors here.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.720]   I mean, I'm well aware of the fact
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.120]   that people tend to imitate other people.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.520]   It's just the question of how good of an excuse is that?
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.720]   There's all my friends, so if all your friends
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.240]   were jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, would you?
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.640]   Well, I don't know, maybe.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.200]   Well, that's pretty foolish, is it not?
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.600]   Do you really even need me to tell you
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.960]   not to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.920]   just 'cause all your friends are doing it?
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.800]   And so I have some other pieces where I just say,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.200]   look, nobody really is willing to actually accept
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.440]   these kinds of lame excuses as a rule
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.160]   because it would mean that you would be going
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.160]   and exonerating people for horrible behavior.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.560]   Someone who says, well, yeah, like I did go
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.280]   and commit a lot of war crimes,
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.760]   but there were a lot of other soldiers
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.800]   doing war crimes too around me.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.720]   It was like, well, did they kill you
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.680]   if you didn't participate?
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.280]   No, but they would have laughed at me
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.160]   if I didn't go along with it.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.720]   Yeah, well, yeah, sometimes you need to be laughed at
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.440]   so you don't become a murderer.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.640]   I don't think you really need me to tell you that.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.240]   It's obvious enough when you think about it,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.640]   it's a very lame excuse to say, well,
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.240]   but the other soldiers would have laughed at me
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.120]   if I said, let's not burn this village down
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.200]   and I don't wanna participate.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.760]   By the way, this was also, I believe,
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.120]   the point of a pretty famous book,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.360]   "Hitler's Willing Executioners,"
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.640]   which asked the question, what happened to Germans
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.280]   who just said, I'm not participating in the Holocaust?
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.480]   You might think it's a totalitarian despotism,
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.840]   you're gonna get shot yourself
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.960]   or you're sent to the concentration camp yourself
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.360]   if you say, I refuse to go along with this
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.120]   immoral plan that you have.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.840]   And what the book said is hardly any Germans
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.680]   were ever punished for refusing to go along.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.760]   They would just say, okay, well,
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.920]   he's not very comfortable with this,
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.520]   so I guess we won't make him.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.200]   It was like, that's all that it took?
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.760]   I mean, it's one thing to say,
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.560]   do you have the courage to go and die
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.560]   to avoid going and hurting an innocent person?
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.960]   And it's a very different thing to say,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.280]   do you have the courage to not be laughed at
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.040]   to avoid being a murderer?
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.360]   Like, that's not that big of an ask, actually.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.280]   And I will say, and I think many of your listeners
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.960]   will remember, are there times
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.120]   that you followed your conscience,
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.920]   even though you had some peers laughing at you
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.800]   and you did it anyway?
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.400]   Is it really that hard?
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.240]   Come on.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.680]   - Yeah, but so I guess,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.920]   putting aside the question of moral blame,
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.400]   to the extent, like the argument you're making there
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.080]   when you talk about the willingness of,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.920]   let's say Germans and Nazi Germany,
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   you're making the argument that like,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.960]   oh, human nature is very perceptive
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.160]   to what your peers think and they don't wanna disappoint
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.600]   the people you're working with and so on,
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.360]   or within your community.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.600]   So that implies that causally speaking,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.400]   the community matters a lot or the culture matters a lot.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.480]   So like, what could be, I think Robin Hanson reacting
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.320]   to Tyler Cowen's review of your book,
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   he said, you know, I guess he was kind of amusing.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.880]   So I don't know if he's like necessarily endorsing this,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.720]   but he said, you know,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.840]   maybe this kind of justifies cultural imperialism,
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.920]   where a culture that has better values
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.200]   when it comes to success sequence, adjacent stuff,
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.280]   they could kind of impose them on cultures
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.920]   that have worse values here.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.800]   So like, do you think that anything can be done
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.880]   to improve the culture when it seems dysfunctional
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.720]   in these ways?
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.560]   - Does greatly cutting back on redistribution
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.080]   or making it more conditional upon good behavior
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.360]   count as something we can do?
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.080]   I think that's a really obvious thing is to just say,
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.480]   look, it was pretty easy for you to go
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.840]   and avoid these problems.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.400]   And so we're going to treat you differently
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.120]   because your problems were avoidable
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.760]   and you didn't avoid them.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.960]   So that could just be lower amounts of payments
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.720]   or cut people off sooner,
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.480]   or to say, look, you're not eligible.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.560]   These are all possibilities.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.240]   So there's that.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.440]   In terms of other things to be done,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.440]   I mean, you could actually go
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.160]   and teach the success sequence in schools.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.320]   I don't know that it's going to be all that persuasive
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.640]   because it really is just going and repeating
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.400]   pretty much what you're already telling kids anyway.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.560]   I do have some thought that if you just ramp up
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.560]   the level of preaching by a factor of 10 or 50
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.400]   then maybe it would work.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.920]   So there is a lot of research saying
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.720]   that various things don't work.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.240]   And then the question is, well, they don't work
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.640]   because they have zero effect
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.120]   or they don't work because the dosage is too low.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.720]   And honestly, I often think the problem
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.960]   is really the low dosage.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.400]   It's just the question of, is this an organization
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.800]   that is actually has the steel to give a very high dosage?
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.280]   For example, foreign language education, right?
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.520]   The kind of foreign language education
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.680]   that goes on in American high schools
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   essentially has zero effectiveness.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.800]   And yet people do learn foreign languages.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.280]   How do they learn foreign languages?
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.400]   Well, you basically learn it when you take the intensity
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.680]   of a normal high school program
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.360]   and you ramp it up by a factor of 10 or 50
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.440]   and then people learn.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.480]   Now, given how much time schools
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.920]   are already spending on foreign language,
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.160]   which is typically in say a place like California
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.000]   is three years out of high school.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.600]   You don't really have the time to ramp it up
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.000]   by a factor of 10 or 50.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.120]   It would just absorb the entire program.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.360]   And that's where you say the amount of effort
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.200]   that would be required to go and actually get fluency
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.760]   in Spanish is so high that we're better off not trying.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.600]   - Right.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.640]   - For something like this,
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.600]   where people really are messing up their lives
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.440]   at a pretty early age,
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.560]   then maybe, and especially if you're not currently
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.240]   giving them three years of advice,
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.440]   you might only be giving them a few hours per year
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.640]   when you add it all up.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.000]   Maybe you did go and multiply that by a lot,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.880]   then it would actually have the effectiveness
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.400]   you're looking for.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.440]   Definitely it's the kind of thing I say,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.680]   it's worth just trying and seeing whether it work.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.480]   If we just go and make a much bigger effort here
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.280]   and also just consider A/B testing
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.960]   where some people just get the lecture
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.600]   and some people you go and actually meet people
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.280]   who've messed up their lives.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.240]   I mean, honestly, I don't think it would be at all
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.400]   a bad idea to go and recruit homeless people
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.440]   to go and talk to kindergartners.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.760]   (laughs)
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.640]   And just, especially you're in a poor area.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.120]   So you see these guys that are just sitting
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.960]   on the side of the road.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.280]   Well, let's bring them in and talk to them
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.520]   and find out what's going on.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.440]   Ask them what they think they did wrong with their lives.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.640]   If anything, right?
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.160]   I mean, again, I think people would just be so squeamish.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.880]   Like you don't wanna go and traumatize five-year-olds
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.400]   by having them meet a homeless person
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.920]   and have them talk about his crack problem or whatever.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.200]   But I would say, why not?
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.040]   Like, if you just convince one kid in the class
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.720]   not to become homeless with this experience,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.120]   or again, if one isn't enough, do it 10 times,
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.520]   do it like twice a year until you finish high school.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.560]   Right, it seems like it's at least worth a try.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.000]   Like it couldn't cost much.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.520]   Going slightly off topic.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.240]   Does the fact that foreign remote workers
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.000]   are paid many multiples less than Americans
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.560]   who are also remote workers,
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.680]   does that suggest that foreigners are lower productivity
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.520]   than you think?
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.840]   Maybe there's like some cultural barriers
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.080]   that are preventing them from being as valuable
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.080]   as Americans are.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.240]   Maybe there's some other factor.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.160]   But in any case, why is the fact that programmers in India
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.360]   who are working remotely are paid much less than programmers
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.960]   in America who are working remotely,
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.320]   does that suggest that actually the people in India
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.400]   are actually lower productivity than you think?
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.240]   - It definitely suggests it.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.480]   However, we have tests to show the suggestion is wrong.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.960]   Because we actually, we know what happens
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.720]   when you are a remote programmer in India,
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.320]   but we also know what happens when you move
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.000]   that remote worker to the US or another first world country.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.640]   And then we see the wages skyrocket.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.440]   So it seems like the most you could say
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.600]   is there might be some interaction between being foreign
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.040]   and being remote.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.920]   At least we know that being foreign and being present
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.440]   in a first world economy in no way predicts lower pay
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.960]   or probably also like no difference
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.720]   in job performance really.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.680]   So now as to why that is, I mean, one thing is that
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.840]   we've had the remote work took such a huge,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.840]   there was such a huge increase during COVID
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.040]   that right now we perhaps we're just not in equilibrium yet.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.560]   So right now it may be that it's taking time
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.800]   for first world companies to say, wait,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.880]   we know we could get better workers that are as good
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.440]   for all this money in the third world.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.320]   So maybe that's what's going on.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.840]   But I have to think that there is a reason
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.600]   why remote work, first of all, was rare before.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.000]   And second of all, why most firms are eager to return
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.480]   to in-person work.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.320]   So I think you have to think
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.040]   that there are some serious problems with it
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.640]   that are maybe a little hard to articulate.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.360]   My best guess here is just that while it may be not that bad
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.480]   to go and switch remote work
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.840]   when you already have a well-functioning team
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.880]   that you have assembled for in-person work,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.480]   but it's probably a lot harder to get
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.840]   a well-functioning team that has never been in person.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.160]   So essentially you might think of in-person work
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.400]   as being an investment in being able to cooperate well,
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.360]   whether or not you're in person or remote in the future.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.320]   And if you've never been anything other than remote,
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.880]   then maybe the team building doesn't work so well.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.720]   But again, the other possibility is that we're just
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.040]   not in equilibrium yet.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.480]   Again, the economic argument comes down to
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.040]   if you really can get someone just as good
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.520]   for a third of the price from another country
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.920]   for remote work, then why don't you do it?
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.880]   Right now, again, of course there is the answer
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.000]   of lower productivity, which again, I say is plausible
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.600]   until you actually see what happens
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.280]   and you move that same worker into the first world
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.320]   and you say, nope, turns out he was just fine.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.440]   And the problem was probably remote work
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.640]   or maybe there's something about remote work
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.160]   and being in another country as well
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.440]   that might make it happen.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.600]   So the other way, I do have a friend
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.920]   who's actually American living in Spain
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.000]   and he's applying for remote jobs
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.720]   and it doesn't work for him either.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.320]   And so it's not something about being Spanish.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.720]   It seems to be that a US company isn't interested in him
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.160]   because he's in Spain, even though he is
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.560]   a well-credentialed American and that is a problem for him.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.520]   Now, again, like you might say,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.920]   why doesn't he just claim to be in Michigan?
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.880]   Though the problem is he has been in Spain for a long time
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.560]   and therefore his whole CV is Spain-oriented.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.600]   So it looks like he is not well integrated
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.520]   into the US labor market at this point.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.920]   But yeah, but it is a very good question.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.480]   - Potential explanation occurs to me.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.000]   I don't know if this makes any sense,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.240]   but could you apply the signaling explanation here?
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.040]   So just like college,
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.760]   going through the immigration process signals
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.080]   that you have high conscientiousness and high conformity
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   and gives you more information about their background
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.040]   as far as crime and other things are concerned
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.200]   and even hiring within America would give, right?
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.120]   So maybe it's like a signaling story,
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.840]   like going through immigration, just the same way college is.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.520]   - Yeah, the problem is the immigration system,
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.680]   I just don't think is really very democratic at all.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.200]   It's quite arbitrary.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.640]   I mean, remember, we even have the diversity lottery.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.040]   So if you see that someone got into the US
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.960]   by winning the immigration lottery or inclined to say,
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.960]   well, if he's just a lottery winner, he just got lucky.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.320]   So I should think that he's not that good, right?
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.400]   That's not actually the normal reaction.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.160]   So I don't think, and that's a case where, you know,
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.960]   there's an enormous amount of luck involved.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.720]   Let's see, and then again, for other stuff,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.640]   it's just so obvious
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.320]   that it's mostly about family reunification, really.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.440]   So it's like, look, this person was lucky enough
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.640]   to have relatives.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.160]   I mean, there is some level of commitment
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.320]   to go and filling out paperwork and so on.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.960]   But yeah, as to how much that makes you enthusiastic
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.120]   about hiring the person.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.320]   And then on top of all of this,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.600]   we actually have a whole separate body of evidence
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.320]   on illegal immigrants.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.720]   Where employers definitely seem to be more reluctant
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.560]   to hire illegal immigrants,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.600]   but almost all of that appears to be just the problem
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.880]   of compliance and getting caught, right?
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.280]   And we know this because we actually have the experiment
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.400]   of when you regularize illegal immigrants,
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.280]   then very quickly they get a big raise.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.760]   So again, if you're an employer and you really thought
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.280]   that it's only the legal immigrants
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.440]   that have signaled something good about themselves,
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.640]   then when you see that there's an illegal immigrant
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.160]   who was regularized, then you should hold it against them
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.400]   and say, well, since you didn't go through
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.040]   the normal process, then I have to think
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.680]   that he's of low quality compared to other immigrants.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.560]   And this is not seen to be the normal reaction
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.800]   that employers have.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.520]   Normal reaction is great.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.360]   Now I can hire the guy I wanted to,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.640]   plus I don't have to worry about getting fined
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.680]   or shut down or raided or anything else.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.240]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.760]   What does the education system look like in equilibrium
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.920]   given there's no government cuts?
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.600]   'Cause if there's credential inflation,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.760]   isn't it just like an escalating cycle?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.680]   So like eventually, I mean, it wouldn't make sense
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.600]   like eventually to get to the point
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.680]   where you need a PhD to be a janitor.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.760]   To like, what does equilibrium look like?
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.600]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.000]   So I would say actually that if you keep the level
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.760]   of funding constant, then I would think
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.360]   that we've reached equilibrium already.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.160]   And there's actually periods when the share
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.680]   of Americans with college degrees was actually quite flat.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.320]   So basically during late '80s, early '90s, I believe,
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.760]   the share of, like this would be, what would it be?
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.240]   Like share of like 25 to 29-year-old Americans
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   who had finished bachelor's degrees was quite flat
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.800]   for about 15 years, which then led many people to say,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.400]   okay, we've reached equilibrium and now it's over.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.720]   Then afterwards, it resumed its upward increase
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.600]   and it went from like 20, 25%.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.240]   Now we're getting at like, what, 35% of people
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.680]   in each bracket have finished four-year degrees.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.760]   As to what were the shocks to the system?
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.640]   Yeah, that's an interesting question.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.160]   And I don't have more than speculation here.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.440]   Part of what's going on, of course,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.920]   is that much of the rise is driven by women.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.760]   So there is a growing disparity
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.920]   between male four-year college graduation
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.200]   and female four-year college graduation.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.880]   And so I think a lot of what's going on
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.040]   is that this is a period when it's becoming more
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.240]   and more normative for women to go and go to college
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.080]   and to get their four-year degrees.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.280]   And there's, as I said, people are conformist.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.080]   So once, if you are a young woman,
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.240]   you see this is what almost all the other young women
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.200]   are doing, then they're inclined to go and do that.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.040]   So in terms of sheer affordability,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.800]   this is overall a period
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.000]   when college was becoming less affordable.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.920]   It's easy to exaggerate that
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.240]   because there's also so much financial aid.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   And then furthermore, of course,
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.640]   people are getting richer on top of that.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.640]   So that is complicated, but nevertheless,
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.520]   at least I would say that it's probably not driven
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.680]   by changes in affordability too much.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.640]   Let's see, I mean, like another story
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.040]   is just the rising inequality is another reason
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.160]   to go and get more education.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.440]   So when the gap between high school graduates
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.800]   and college graduates goes up,
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.160]   this is a reason for more people to go.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.640]   So there's probably that too.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.400]   So you can get changes in just the structure of the economy,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.440]   higher return to quality,
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.560]   that kind of thing also matters, right?
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.240]   But yeah, but I would say that the idea
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.720]   that there's just an actual tendency
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.280]   for education to rise no matter what,
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.120]   I think that's wrong.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.320]   There's this old line attributed to Herb Stein
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.680]   that anything that can't go on forever
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.720]   won't go on forever.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.440]   Very reasonable point.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.360]   As to how far it can go though.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.720]   Oh yeah, there is something else
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.120]   that I don't think we have really good data on this,
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.240]   but I strongly suspect it,
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.800]   which is that schools are constantly
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.680]   slightly lowering their standards over time
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.840]   in order to make it easier to finish.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.080]   So that's something where it's very clear
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.520]   they lower their standards between '65 and today.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.920]   The curriculum was just much more
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.160]   intellectually demanding back then.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.840]   It is harder to say with great confidence
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.240]   they lowered standards between 2000 and 2022,
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.320]   but that is definitely my suspicion.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.280]   It's one where if you are a college professor,
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.360]   especially in a lower rank school,
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.160]   you'll appreciate what the pressure is,
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.080]   which is every year you have a class of students,
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.320]   most of them don't wanna be there
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.520]   and really are non-academically inclined.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.360]   And then the question is
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.160]   how many of them am I gonna fail out?
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.360]   Now, if you have any pride in your work at all,
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.160]   you'll start by failing the people who never showed up
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.560]   and didn't even do the exam, right?
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.840]   So it's like, okay, well, I can fire them
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.680]   with good conscience,
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.640]   plus I don't even know what they look like,
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.760]   so it doesn't hurt my feelings
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.920]   and I don't feel bad for them when I flunk them.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.760]   But then there's this question of,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.680]   what about the people that showed up and tried, but no zero?
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.160]   What do I do about them?
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.480]   Most professors' pride still says,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.840]   "No, I can't pass that person, it's sad, but I can't."
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.720]   But when you do it for 30 years in a row,
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.880]   probably there's a general tendency each time
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.800]   to go and fail maybe like 0.2 fewer people per year.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.480]   And then over time, this happens.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.720]   And then there's also a culture
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.600]   of what is an acceptable share to fail.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.880]   And then as the standards fall,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.120]   you get weaker students there,
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.040]   and then the process continues to amplify
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.480]   where the standards keep going down.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.440]   So I do think that there's been a lowering of standards,
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.840]   which means that more people wanna go to college
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.560]   because they can actually have a prayer of getting through.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.520]   And then when you do that,
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.800]   that does spur further credential inflation
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   because you've got too many people
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.280]   with low quality with the degrees in hand,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.640]   and so you need an additional degree piled on top
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.600]   to get much confidence in the quality.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.400]   - Right, so then why don't more employers
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.720]   care about the hardness of a curriculum for their college
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.560]   that they're interviewing students from
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.760]   in comparison to what level of degree they have?
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.280]   So they'll care like does he have a master's or a bachelor's?
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.600]   They'll care less about like,
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.400]   did he go to UChicago or Harvard?
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.280]   I've heard that UChicago is much harder, right?
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.720]   But employers don't seem to care that much.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.920]   Oh, that's an even stronger signal of conscientiousness
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.560]   that he went to UChicago,
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.880]   as long as the incoming class had a similar GPA and SAT score.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.040]   Like shouldn't employers care about that?
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.440]   - Yeah, good question.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.040]   So here's what we know about the actual payoffs
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.400]   of different kinds of college degrees.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.400]   The single best predictor of payoff is your major.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.520]   And the majors that are thought by most people to be harder
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.000]   generally have much better payoffs.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.840]   - That's right, yeah.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.320]   - So step one is employers are doing that.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.280]   They are much more eager to go on higher STEM majors,
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.880]   econ majors for your listeners
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.920]   who are trying to figure out what they wanna do,
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.360]   earn a lot more than business majors.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.640]   And you might think they're the same,
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.720]   but the world treats econ majors
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   almost as well as CS or electrical engineers,
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.840]   which when I discovered it, I was kind of amazed.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.480]   I'm like, wow, what a deal.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.880]   I always tell my students,
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.480]   economics is the highest paid of all the easy majors.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.680]   And when they start getting flustered and say,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.480]   "Easy, it's all," like, look, this is not CS.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.160]   We're not getting vitamin D deprivation
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.640]   from going and doing your work
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.160]   for 72 hours straight underground.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.960]   Come on, like, yeah, so it's harder than business,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.560]   but it's not hard, absolutely.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.360]   Just put in a little bit of effort and you'll get through
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.080]   as long as you can do pretty basic advanced math.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.800]   Now, if you don't, you can take a derivative
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.240]   of an easy function, you can get through econ.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.680]   Yes, so anyway, so the major is the single biggest one.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.840]   Now, there is a big literature on why is it that,
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.480]   on the return to selectivity of colleges,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.840]   definitely very subtle differences
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.600]   like Harvard or Chicago.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.120]   It's very hard to pick up much there.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.320]   But again, I think you could just say,
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.560]   yeah, well, employers don't distinguish
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.680]   because hardly anyone goes to those schools.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.480]   They are really close, in fact, in terms of their quality.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.440]   They are gonna distinguish between Harvard
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.840]   and say, Cal State Northridge, something like that.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.720]   There is a puzzle about why don't employers
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.760]   seem to care more than they do
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.800]   about the selectivity of college.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.080]   And it seems like part of it, it gets picked up in the major
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.280]   because harder colleges,
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.720]   people are more likely to do harder majors.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.920]   And then another part of what's going on
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.280]   is people are looking at your overall background.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.640]   So when we say that selectivity doesn't matter much,
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.080]   this is adjusting for a lot of other facts about you.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.600]   So if we didn't, then we would see
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.560]   that we do actually have a noticeable gain
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.000]   from the selectivity of your college.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.600]   So I guess my main answer would be
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.200]   that they already are using a lot of information
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.160]   to distinguish it.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.360]   And then really it comes down to,
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.760]   for some further really fine grain differences,
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.880]   why don't they pay more attention to those?
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.080]   And I think the easy answer is the fine grain differences
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.800]   just don't come up that often.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.840]   And then on top of all of it,
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.160]   so much of worker quality really does have to be observed.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.800]   So it's enough to get you in the door,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.360]   but there's enough uncertainty remaining
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.360]   where you can say, well, look,
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.040]   it's the difference between having say a 78% chance
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:43.880]   the person works out
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.840]   and a 76% chance the person works out.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.280]   That's almost a rounding error.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.360]   So if I'd have a little bit of other information
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.560]   on the person that would normally be 76,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.040]   that can put me over the top
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.320]   and get me to go and give that person a chance.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.240]   So I think that what's going on
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.400]   is actually quite a bit more reasonable
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.240]   than you might think
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.720]   if you don't know a lot of the details.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.120]   - Right, yeah.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.200]   Okay, so another point you make in the book
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.360]   is that market discrimination is often caused
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.600]   actually by government interference
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.880]   and then it will solve itself in equilibrium.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.400]   But I mean, if you just look at
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.480]   college discrimination of Asians, right?
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.560]   So the government is not requiring Harvard
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.640]   to like discriminate against Asians.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.400]   But, and in fact, it like lowers the signal
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.040]   that Harvard is able to send
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.680]   if they do aggressive affirmative action.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.280]   But, and even like actual companies
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.920]   that are in the market proper, like Google or something,
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.640]   they'll do affirmative action too, right?
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.280]   I mean, you could say like a little bit of that
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.400]   is required by discrimination law,
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.480]   but probably not to the magnitude they're doing it.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.120]   So like, what is the explanation
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.680]   for why that hasn't been solved out by just competition?
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.080]   - Right, so there's multiple things going on.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.960]   So for colleges, the key thing is that they're nonprofits.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.200]   And so I have this running argument
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.760]   with my colleague, Alex Tabarrok.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.640]   There is a whole economics of discrimination
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.360]   based upon the idea that, for example,
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   if it was really true that women earn 70%
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.760]   as much as equally qualified men,
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.120]   that any moron has a get rich quick scheme,
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.320]   just fire all the men at your firm
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.800]   or place them with equally qualified women
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.480]   and save a massive amount on your labor costs.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.040]   So that's sort of the classic economic argument.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.040]   And I think it's basically sound.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.360]   But the key premise is precisely
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.440]   that you're dealing with for-profit organizations
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.840]   where there's someone that is willing to do something
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.720]   that sounds ugly in order to get rich.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.000]   And so, I mean, I'm always telling them,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.760]   look, this does not apply to nonprofits
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.000]   like academic departments or universities.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.240]   So that's the first thing that I would say
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.200]   is that nonprofits, at minimum,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.520]   the pressure on them to not discriminate
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.400]   is much weaker than for-profits.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   So I would distinguish those two quite strongly, actually.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.680]   And I'd say, actually, nonprofits,
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.840]   you should definitely expect them to do more discrimination.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.040]   Then the question just is what kind of discrimination
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.360]   are they inclined to do?
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.200]   So this is one where, in the old days,
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.920]   when there was a lot of antisemitism atop schools,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.960]   then the top schools would be engaged
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.000]   in discrimination against Jews.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.680]   Well, how could they afford to do that?
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.520]   Easy, they're sitting on a mountain of money
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.000]   that isn't theirs, right?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.480]   They're not gonna go bankrupt
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.920]   if they go and have a tight Jewish quota.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.920]   It's not like there's any skin off the nose
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.640]   of the admissions department,
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.160]   and therefore they can engage
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.200]   in whatever discriminatory preferences they may have,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.080]   precisely because they are a nonprofit.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.520]   - So then what explains the discrimination
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.840]   at Google, for example?
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.480]   - Yes, so I was just about to get to that.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.000]   Now, in the case of for-profit businesses,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.160]   again, there is a certain kind of superstar company
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.360]   like Google where they are so rich
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.720]   that at least you might say, huh,
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.960]   they could probably afford to discriminate
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.800]   for 100 years too and still survive.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.520]   Also, there are a few companies like that
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.280]   where they have just been so incredibly successful
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.760]   that now they're sitting on a mountain of money,
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.080]   and then they're not up against the wall saying,
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.720]   oh my God, if we don't do everything great,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.320]   then we're going out of business.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.720]   So now it's important to remember,
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.640]   there's very few companies like that.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.240]   They're famous.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.080]   Also worth pointing out,
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.440]   the companies that think they're in that position forever,
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.800]   it's not like Harvard.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.000]   There are a whole bunch of companies
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.760]   that were in the same position as Google
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.480]   that are now bankrupt.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.200]   So even there, I think the people at Google
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.600]   do have some sense that there are limits to this.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.680]   Now, in terms of what the actual role
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.800]   of discrimination law is,
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.360]   I think that in the case of colleges,
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.200]   they are definitely going further than the law requires
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.840]   because they're true believers there,
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.720]   and the true believers are especially concentrated
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.600]   in the admissions departments.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.400]   So that's where I'd say the main thing is the nonprofits.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.720]   Although even there, they do have the threat
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   to hang over the heads of other people
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.360]   in the administration, which is,
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.720]   well, we don't want to be perceived
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.840]   as doing clearly less than other comparable schools.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:56.880]   That is an important thing that you don't want to do
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.000]   if you want to avoid lawsuits,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   is to be obviously the group or the organization
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.840]   that cares less than everybody else and does less.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.520]   So for nonprofits, I think that there is a bit of that.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.800]   In the case of for-profit companies,
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.560]   I think actually that discrimination law
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.040]   is a major part of the reason
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.480]   why they actually are supportive of affirmative action
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.120]   because they don't want to be less supportive
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.940]   than any comparable company, at least in an obvious way,
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.000]   for fear that then they will paint a target
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.480]   on their own backs.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.840]   So I have a couple of pieces that I wrote on this.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.000]   I think they're gonna be in a different book,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.480]   if I remember correctly,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.000]   'cause actually this is the first in a series of eight books
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.760]   of my best blog posts on EconLog from 2005 to 2022.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.520]   But anyway, what I say in another piece
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.840]   is that just imagine what would happen
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.040]   if you were a well-known firm
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.960]   and you just officially announced,
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.760]   "We strongly oppose any kind of witch hunt
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.060]   about discrimination.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.920]   This firm is very fair,
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.240]   and we scrutinize all accusations of racism and sexism
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.680]   very carefully to make sure
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.480]   that you are not making false accusations
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.620]   against an innocent person."
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.960]   Now, imagine that you very loudly say this.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.160]   Right now, of course, there's protests and boycotts
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.920]   and so on that you might get.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.000]   But on top of all of this,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.280]   if you ever get sued, that is going to be discovered,
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.160]   and they are gonna introduce it and say,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.620]   "This is a firm where they actively punish people
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.960]   for going and trying to insist upon their rights."
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.320]   And you say, "Hey, we were in compliance
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.640]   with the letter of the law.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.900]   Well, how is a jury likely to see it?"
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.240]   When they say, "This is what a normal firm looks like,
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.760]   where you have a bunch of propaganda
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.320]   about how we are doing everything in our power
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.360]   to go and help oppress groups."
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.320]   And then there's another firm,
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.040]   and then we show, "And what do we have at this firm?"
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.960]   This firm is where you say,
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.260]   "At our firm, the battle against racism and sexism
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.660]   has long been since won.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.800]   We consider it an extremely minor problem,
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.120]   and our presumption is that accusations will be false.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.520]   We'll listen, but we are firmly convinced
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.120]   that we are in the fairness of our own system,
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.360]   and so we are going to carefully scrutinize
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.240]   and discipline people who level false accusations."
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.760]   But I think if you were that firm,
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.080]   you really would be painting a giant target on your back.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.240]   It would not be safe.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.840]   And this, again, is how there has been an expansion
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.720]   of discrimination law over time.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.040]   So like sexual harassment law, at the federal level,
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.960]   the first thing, there is no law against sexual harassment.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.680]   Rather, this is just a judicial extension
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.660]   of the original '64 Discrimination Act.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.600]   But it started with saying, "All right, well, look,
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.200]   obviously it's illegal to discriminate.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.560]   That's what the law says.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.280]   Well, what if that you're just treated badly?"
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.120]   Right, well, hmm.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.620]   Well, yeah, I guess that could be discrimination too, right?
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.760]   Yes, well, like is discrimination because of your sex?
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.120]   Yes, well, what if you'll be like,
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.160]   women get paid the same amount,
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.560]   they get promoted the same amount,
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.600]   but there's a bunch of calendars
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.000]   with women in bikinis around the firm.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.400]   Could that be discrimination?
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.600]   And then this is the origin of the law
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.220]   of the hostile workplace.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.440]   Now, sometime in the '70s,
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.880]   there was one of my very favorite all-time court cases
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.640]   where there was a bisexual employer
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.460]   who was accused of sexual harassment.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.440]   And he said, "It's not discrimination.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.200]   I harass men and women alike totally.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Like, I am totally within the letter of the law."
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.800]   And if ever a person was totally legally in the right
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.320]   was that guy.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.720]   That guy, like I say, unquestionably,
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.440]   he had the law on his side, but he lost anyway.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   So the court basically said,
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.940]   "Look, we're not gonna let bisexuals
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.720]   get away with sexual harassment
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.480]   when other people can't do it."
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.840]   Like, "No, no, we're not gonna allow that, no."
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.720]   Right, and so it continued and then expanded
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.840]   to what we have now where people can get sued
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.080]   because some employees told jokes or graffitied a bathroom.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.760]   So that is at the level where we're at.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.680]   Now, again, this doesn't mean that most firms
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.000]   have much to worry about, but it's hanging over your head.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.200]   And it's a reason, at least for prominent firms,
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.280]   to avoid doing anything,
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.560]   because prominent firms are like piggy banks, right?
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   They're full of money and people are just waiting there.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.840]   "Hey, Elon Musk has a lot of money.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.800]   What if we could go and sue him?
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.400]   He could pay, so let's go after him."
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.160]   If it's just some guy's paint store,
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.680]   then probably not much is gonna happen to you.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.380]   Although even there, you're just a little bit worried.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.600]   Now, the other thing to remember
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.200]   is that a lawsuit is not just a loss of money,
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.760]   it's also enormously stressful.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.480]   So don't underestimate just the worry of that.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.600]   And just think about what it's like,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.560]   if you've been sued once,
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.120]   how do you feel about getting sued twice?
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.640]   I think almost anyone's been sued once.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.140]   They're like, "That was a terrible experience for them."
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.880]   And they will be trying to think of ways
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.640]   to avoid having it happen again.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.680]   One thing, of course, is to be super cautious,
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.340]   but there's a lot of ways of being super cautious.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.360]   There's also the one where like,
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.120]   "Well, I profile people who might sue me
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:56.960]   and I don't hire them."
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.240]   There's something else you can do.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.400]   - Okay, so I wanna ask you about mental illness.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.760]   So you're aware of Hanania's book where he explains
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   that the unitary actor model
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.840]   can't explain American foreign policy.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.300]   It's not one rational actor.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.520]   It's these diverse interest groups
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.680]   that are within the establishment.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.780]   - I think I see where this is going.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.620]   - Huh?
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:18.820]   - I think I see where this is going.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.660]   - Right, right.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.400]   So yeah, I was just about to say,
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.560]   can't you treat individual personalities this way?
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.440]   So there's different ways to think about this.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.320]   Maybe you can think of modules within the brain
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.520]   that are trying to entice you this way or that,
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.240]   and they temporarily could get ahold of you.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.320]   Maybe, I don't know, personality farts,
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.280]   it ego, whatever.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   There's different ways you can talk about this,
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.560]   but could you apply a similar model to individuals
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.480]   where you say, just as you wouldn't say
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.200]   the average American is responsible for the mistakes
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.720]   of American foreign policy,
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.960]   like the individual is not responsible
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.720]   for the weird things that parts of their personality
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.580]   makes them do, right?
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.420]   - Right.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.880]   So I guess my first reaction to this is just introspection
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.260]   and say, "Look, I don't experience my mind
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.080]   as being like a bunch of interest groups
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.400]   that are pushing and shoving."
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.720]   - But you're not mentally ill, right?
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.560]   - Yes.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.040]   Well, so, well, here's the thing.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:07.880]   There's two versions of it.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.960]   One is just to say that everybody's like this,
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.000]   and then the mentally ill basically
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.040]   have worse interest groups.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.720]   And then the other one is to say
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.200]   that normal people are unitary,
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.920]   and then the mentally ill are outliers who are not unitary.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.880]   Right, so these are two different stories.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.440]   The main thing that I would say is like any,
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.960]   there is actually a whole literature
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.200]   on hyperbolic discounting that, right,
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.560]   or self-control problems in general
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.200]   that tries to think of the mentally ill
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.320]   as being people that just fail to go
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.040]   and do the best long-run plan
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.200]   and instead focus on short-run plans.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.880]   What I'd say is this is actually just a deeply wrong story
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.920]   about what's going on
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.840]   with at least the severely mentally ill.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.840]   So here's the thing.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.960]   The difference between people
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.000]   that get diagnosed as severely mentally ill
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.280]   and people who just have some moderate problems
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.440]   is precisely that the severely mentally ill
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.600]   are stubbornly convinced that they wanna do
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.720]   the objectionable stuff they wanna do.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.400]   So basically, if you're someone that says,
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.800]   "Gee, I have these violent urges.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.160]   "I need to go to a psychiatrist.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.040]   "I'm trying to control my violent urges.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.280]   "What can I do?"
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.360]   All right, you'll get classified
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.160]   as a moderately mentally ill person.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.000]   But on the other hand,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.480]   the person who is a full-blown serial killer,
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.080]   every second of their day, they're stalking prey.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.160]   That person seems very unitary,
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.480]   more unitary than most people, actually.
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.000]   And yet we'll call that person severely mentally ill,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.080]   and that's the person who probably, if they're ever caught,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.520]   will be found not guilty by reason of insanity.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.360]   Why?
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.960]   Because they were so organized and determined and focused.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.440]   - Wait, but I would say somebody like Ted Bundy,
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.240]   maybe this isn't how the legal system works.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.680]   - I know Ted Bundy, actually, the story.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.240]   At least, I watched a documentary
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.320]   that I read the Wikipedia article.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.600]   I mean, I watched a fictionalization
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.840]   and then read the Wikipedia.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.360]   - It was, I believe it was the Zac Efron version.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.000]   Anyway, I think that the fictionalization
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.400]   was quite accurate.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.440]   So I don't think he's gonna be a good example
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.080]   for what you want, so let's go with it.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:00.920]   - Okay, okay.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.440]   Well, so some other serial killer who actually is unitary.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.840]   I actually don't know the story that well,
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.960]   but I think we have more sympathy for the person
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.280]   who has, I don't know, fits bad behavior,
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.720]   but is generally a nice person.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.400]   So we do understand, oh, this is a person
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.880]   who is not a unitary actor,
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.560]   and therefore we can sympathize with the part of him
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.600]   that's not this way.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.440]   We sympathize more with them
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.280]   than the person who's wholly mentally ill,
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.360]   but like is just pursuing a bad aim throughout, right?
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.440]   So I think that our understanding.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.600]   - But I say there's still something weird about that
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.920]   because you say, okay, so we got a regular person
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.400]   and we're not worried about them,
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.080]   or we think they've got a unit, they're a unitary actor.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.720]   Then you got the severely mentally ill
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.120]   and we think they're unitary.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.840]   And then we come down to the person who has fits
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.080]   and we say, they're the people
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.360]   where our regular story doesn't fit.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.040]   And that might be right, right?
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.360]   But it's weird.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.400]   It's like, hmm.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.840]   So the people that we normally think
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.000]   of as severely mentally ill
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.560]   also seem to be very unitary.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.240]   So our story is not that they are fighting
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.480]   against uncontrollable urges,
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.680]   rather they identify with the horrible urges.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.960]   There's really nothing to them other than this person,
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.520]   like that's at least the heart of the person
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.560]   is that they are a person who stalks other people
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.880]   to torture and kill them.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.800]   And this is the main thing that they do for fun, right?
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.400]   It's like, gee, really?
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.320]   I mean, so I have read more than my fair share
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.240]   of biographies of serial killers.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.680]   So yeah, it's the best story about them.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.960]   You know, there's a little bit of,
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.280]   oh gee, why am I this way?
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.200]   Oh, well, time to go and murder and torture another person.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.600]   In the other case, that's one where I will say
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.640]   that I'm just more confused as to what's going on.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.920]   Again, I mean, again, like there are some cases
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.360]   where at least I'm very strongly inclined to say,
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.120]   you know, like that, look,
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.640]   like it still seems to be very strategically designed
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.880]   to avoid social consequences.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.400]   So someone who is not a homeless level alcoholic
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.560]   where they drink so much
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.640]   that no one even wants to have anything to do with them,
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.160]   but just someone who is periodically drunk
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.720]   to the point where their family's very distressed about it.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.640]   Again, it's easy to say like this,
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.480]   the devil rum is a hold of me,
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.160]   but I was like, well, does it though?
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.240]   Or is it more of that's a convenient excuse for you
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.720]   to do some of what you obviously
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.560]   have a very strong desire to do?
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.880]   You know, like, you know, I'm not, again,
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.680]   I'm not saying that is the absolutely every case,
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.240]   but still, you know, I guess the way that I think
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.360]   about mental illness is we have this very large category
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   that has emerged in modern society as such a large share
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.800]   of humanity winds up getting so diagnosed.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.440]   And a lot of what I wind up doing is saying,
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.360]   look, we can cut out a lot of this.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.840]   A lot of this really doesn't, you know,
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:48.200]   it doesn't make sense to think of it as a disease.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.760]   And then we, you know, we can remove half,
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.440]   oh yeah, we can remove half for some reasons,
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.200]   we can move another 30% for other reasons,
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.400]   we can move another 10% for some other reasons.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.000]   And at the end, we're left with some cases
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.680]   where I'll just say, I don't know, maybe,
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.840]   it's just hard to say.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.640]   So, you know, my son the other day was asking me like,
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.760]   what would make you most convinced
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.520]   that a person really did have
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.360]   what we think of as a mental illness?
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.560]   And I said, like, honestly, it would come down to,
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   I do have known the person really well for a really long time
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.120]   and they always seem very honest and reliable.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.320]   And then they say, I just feel something strange
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.400]   happening to me inside of my head, right?
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.640]   And they said, like, isn't it weird
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.880]   that it's so heavily based upon firsthand anecdotes?
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.960]   And I said, well, the problem is that,
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.720]   like, there isn't really any data for a stranger
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.280]   that would convince me they're super reliable.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.240]   I really do have to have a lot of firsthand experience
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.920]   of the person to take their word for something like that.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.800]   So that's really where I would come down.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.880]   So, you know, Thomas Sauss, who inspired a lot of this,
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.280]   he often spoke as if it was just a conceptual truth
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.320]   and I don't think that's true.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.040]   I think it's more of one where it's just,
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.120]   what is the story about what's going on
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.960]   in someone else's head that makes the most sense?
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.120]   So when someone is doing something very strange,
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.800]   that makes the most sense to say,
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.840]   that person has an illness that makes them do that,
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.520]   or does it make more sense to say,
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.520]   that person has just very different goals than I do,
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.920]   but it doesn't mean that they are sick
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.640]   in any meaningful, in anything other
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.280]   than a metaphorical sense.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.120]   Now, seeing like an example that I thought about
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.400]   quite a bit is, what if I had a kid
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.040]   who wanted to become a nun?
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.160]   So like, I want to go and marry Jesus
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.320]   and be celibate and have no grandkids.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.480]   Like, and honestly, if you know anything
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.320]   about all the value put on grandkids,
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.840]   that would be one of the worst things for me to hear.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.760]   And I would just like, no, what are you talking about?
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.920]   This is like, well, this is just what I want to do, right?
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.680]   And yeah, it would be tempting to say, no, no, you're sick.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.440]   We have to go and get you to a doctor
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.920]   to go and explain to you how this is all based
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   upon a delusion that you have this invisible spouse
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.080]   that's going to be your husband,
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.120]   but he just isn't really real.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.800]   And you're giving up your actual genetic figure,
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.000]   you're giving up your genetic future
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.240]   for this thing that has imposed itself upon you.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.440]   And it's like, it's not really what's going on.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.320]   It's like the person is taking seriously
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.600]   a bunch of doctrines that a lot of other people believe
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.280]   and trying to live them consistently.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.800]   And yeah, I object because I think that they're mistaken.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   Right, and of course, I especially object
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.920]   because it's my genes, not just my genes, but also look,
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.200]   I've got plans for being a grandpa.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.960]   I'm like, you're cutting into those plans.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.440]   And I was planning on playing with my grandkids,
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.920]   not going and visiting you at convent.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.360]   That's not the life I want for myself,
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.160]   but it's not the life I want for you.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.160]   So therefore you're sick, right?
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.120]   Very tempting, but just seems like a lie.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:34.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.160]   All right, some rapid fire questions.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.560]   So first is, why is it that multinationals
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.280]   are just so much more effective
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.280]   than companies from developing countries?
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.440]   You would think that they're actually familiar
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.280]   with the culture.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.920]   They know the problems that the country faces.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.120]   So there'd be like a much more effective businesses.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.560]   Why are companies that are founded in America
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.120]   that are foreign to the places where they're working?
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.960]   Why are they just so much more effective?
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:06.440]   - Right, so first of all, just to let people know,
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.680]   this is not just our opinion.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.800]   There is a very impressive body of research
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.840]   saying this very thing.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.360]   So most associated with the research,
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.760]   Nicholas Bloom and John Van Renen.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.280]   But in any case, I'd say that a lot of the answer
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.680]   is that the culture is the problem.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.560]   The culture is the problem.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.840]   So if you have a nepotistic culture to say,
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.560]   well, we need to come up with a hiring practice
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.560]   that works really good in our nepotistic culture.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.680]   It's like, no, no, no.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.480]   The whole problem is the nepotistic culture.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.480]   You've got to switch over to a different cultural norm
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.320]   because nepotism is cross-culturally a bad way
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.200]   to go and run a business.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.000]   Meritocracy is the way to go.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.120]   And this is what multinational companies bring in.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.680]   So that's one of the most obvious ones.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.680]   But then similarly, just having a lack of basic latitude
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.240]   towards punctuality.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.640]   This is another cultural problem that exists in some countries
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.600]   to a much greater degree than others.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.920]   Every country has some late people,
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.720]   but some countries lateness is almost a virtue.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.200]   I was actually talking to a guy who worked at--
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.200]   I believe it was Toyota in Brazil.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.360]   And so Brazilians, he told me, they
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.640]   have a terrible problem with punctuality.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.760]   And what did Toyota Brazil say?
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.200]   Like, if you want to work at Toyota Brazil, punctuality.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.000]   We insist on this.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:21.640]   We'll be fired.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.760]   Zero tolerance for lateness.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.600]   This is our system.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.000]   So really, they actually, to a much greater extent
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.200]   than in Japan, actually openly declared war
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.360]   on the cultural norm of, it doesn't matter exactly
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.400]   when you show up.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.440]   So I think that's probably a lot of the answer,
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.960]   is that the main thing that multinationals do
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:43.160]   is, if there's a cultural norm that can be deployed usefully,
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.080]   then yeah.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.200]   Then probably, actually, local firms would be better at that.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.680]   But what multinationals do is they actually
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.160]   find the universal truths of business,
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.360]   and then they try to teach them to places
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.920]   where these norms go against the culture in order
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.800]   to go and bring them into the world of modern business,
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.360]   raising the productivity, and giving them the opportunities
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.080]   that people in other countries have.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:10.160]   Now, of course, just to be fair, to say Toyota Brazil,
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.480]   like, if you want to work in some inefficiently managed
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.880]   Brazilian firm where they respect
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.960]   Brazilian cultural norms, you can.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.640]   But Toyota paid so much better that it was considered
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   a highly desirable job.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.840]   So it's not just that there's some outside firm that
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.680]   comes in and says, your culture sucks.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.840]   You have to do it our way.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.440]   But rather, there's an outside firm that comes in and says,
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.240]   if you're willing to bend on the culture,
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.440]   we will go and give you a lot more money than you usually
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.080]   get in this country.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.800]   And it turns out a lot of people in those countries
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.000]   are happy to take that deal.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.560]   So if cultural norms explain so much
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.760]   of the difference between the productivity of firms
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.440]   across different countries, then does that make you less bullish
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.040]   about open borders?
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.520]   Because then you're importing people
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.240]   who have cultural norms that are just
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.600]   making companies ineffective from the places where
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.160]   they come from, right?
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.680]   Well, I'm not worried, because basically,
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.880]   companies that are in first world countries
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.360]   are very similar to multinationals
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.720]   in terms of what they do.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.960]   So they don't just go and say, well,
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.040]   whatever people in this area or whatever applicants think
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.320]   is OK is OK.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.200]   Instead, normally, they've got this list
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.040]   of cross-culturally valid rules for the right way
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:09.840]   to run a business.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.280]   And then they say, look, if you want to be here,
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.560]   you're going to have to do them.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.680]   Yeah, you could go and run your own business
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.120]   where you don't have to show up on time
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.320]   and see how that works for you.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.680]   But if you want to go and work at our store,
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.840]   you have to do this.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.240]   So I say, really, what businesses in the first world
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.560]   do is take workers who, on their own,
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:31.520]   would not follow these, because just because you are more
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.360]   open to punctuality than people in Brazil
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.680]   doesn't mean that you're all that thrilled about it.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.760]   But a lot of what employers do is
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.880]   to go and take people that are not really well-suited
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:46.320]   for a team initially and to weld them into a team.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.280]   This is what coaches for athletic teams do, of course,
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.440]   is you take a disorganized rabble
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.240]   and then you whip them into shape.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:58.200]   And this is the very same thing that businesses do routinely
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.680]   is, look, you've got some managers at the top who
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.120]   know how things need to be.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.360]   And then you have a bunch of flawed human material
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.040]   that shows up.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.400]   And what are you going to do with it?
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.200]   You could just say, oh, I can't work with this material.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.120]   It's too hard.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:10.920]   And I give up.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.360]   And then businesses are not run by those people.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.760]   Instead, the normal thing is you have a manager who says,
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   look, first of all, I know what needs to be done.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.320]   Second, I'd like to figure out a way to get people to do it,
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.480]   even though it's not their strong desire, anyway.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.440]   And if you go and read any book on management,
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.400]   it will give you a whole pile of advice on what to do.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.560]   I'm a big fan of Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.360]   and Influence People.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.560]   For example, he says, give everyone a good reputation
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.440]   to live up to.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.880]   Don't go and tell people, you are a terrible late person.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.720]   I hate you.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.840]   That's not very motivating.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.280]   Much better to go and say, first of all,
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.640]   notice what are people on time.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.280]   On time, excellent, great.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.440]   And then secondly, if someone is a little late,
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.720]   say something more along the lines of,
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.840]   gee, normally, you're on time, and I can count on you.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.120]   And it was really hard for me to run the business today.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.000]   Now, obviously, there are some people
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.760]   that don't respond to being nice.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.920]   And then people like that generally
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.080]   get fired after a while.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.160]   By the way, so let's see.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.920]   I think this is actually in another book.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.880]   But you're probably familiar with the book by Barbara
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.640]   Ehrenreich, Nickel and Dimed.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.040]   No.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.080]   So basically, she went and--
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.680]   so famous journalist, went undercover,
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.080]   did a bunch of low-skill jobs, and then
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.160]   wrote about her experience and how terrible it was
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.120]   and how hard it is to be poor in America.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   So anyway, that's the usual write-up of the book.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:27.760]   So I've read it.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.360]   I think it's a fantastic book because there's
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.720]   a little bit of propaganda of that kind.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.400]   But most of it, she just describes very, very neutrally
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.520]   what happened to her.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.720]   And what happened to her is quite different from what
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:42.640]   her summary of what happened actually was.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.920]   So I mean, really, when I read the book,
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.040]   I say, here's a worker who has a very negative attitude.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.640]   And then employers don't appreciate it
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.840]   and try to get her to get a better attitude and do
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.360]   their job.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.800]   So there's a lot of that going on.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.320]   And then furthermore, the other thing
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.780]   that you really get out of the book
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.440]   is that people that are managing very low-skilled workers
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.000]   probably are a lot more emotionally
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.640]   abusive and disrespectful than people
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.800]   that would be managing higher-skilled workers.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.200]   But when you read the book, you realize why,
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:11.960]   which is two things.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.320]   So one is honestly that with higher-skilled workers,
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.600]   they have a lot more pride in their work.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.480]   And so you don't need to be mean to them
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.960]   to get them to do their job well.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.520]   It's more internally motivated.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.960]   Whereas with someone who's washing dishes,
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.800]   it isn't like they wake up every day and say,
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:25.960]   my calling is to wash dishes.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.720]   You really do need to be harder on someone
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.360]   to get them to do their job well.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.840]   But probably an even bigger factor
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.880]   is, who manages a small-town diner?
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:37.320]   Is it someone who has great social skills
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.320]   and knows the right way to make everyone feel
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.240]   like an important, special person?
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.800]   If you were that good of people, you'd
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.440]   be managing something much better than a small-town diner.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.520]   Most people who manage a small-town diner, they're
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.440]   probably someone who was a good worker in that diner.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.160]   And they got promoted.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.280]   And they rose in the ranks.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.680]   Or maybe they actually started their own business
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.600]   and they ran it.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.800]   So again, this is a case where a lot of why
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.120]   it can be unpleasant to be low-skilled workers that are
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.000]   being managed by people whose main experience is
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.080]   being a low-skilled worker.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.720]   And if they had top social skills,
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.400]   they'd be managing a higher status team.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.800]   So that's something else you've got out of the book.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.360]   Right, right.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.600]   OK, final question-- what do you think of Tyler's idea
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.360]   in his book Average is Over that basically the labor market is
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.720]   bifurcating into people who can work with computers
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.240]   and people who are getting substituted by computers?
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.800]   And that's the dominant theme of the labor market.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.760]   Right, I'd say that the last 20 years of empirical research
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.360]   say that's wrong.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.720]   So here's my reading of empirical research.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:35.120]   Empirical research says that from about 1980 to about 2000,
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.320]   there was a fall in the real wages of very low-skilled
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.000]   workers and a corresponding rise in that
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.360]   of very high-skilled workers.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.560]   But then from around 2000, that fall stabilized or even
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.880]   moderately reversed.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:51.480]   And what we've actually seen since then
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.880]   is some fall in mid-skill wages rather than low-skilled.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:00.000]   So I'd say that just the facts don't really fit that story.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.840]   Then secondly, we can see during COVID,
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.240]   actually, there's been so many changes in labor markets.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.880]   But one of the main ones is suddenly there
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.600]   is a great desire to go and attract low-skilled workers.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.880]   As to what's going on, I think there's a lot going on.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.640]   One is that there are still the hangover
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.120]   of some of the most enormous redistribution
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.080]   in American history and world history, where even when it's
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.240]   cut off, still there's a lot of people who previously
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.040]   were working because they had debts to pay,
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:29.160]   and then they paid off all their debt during COVID.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.440]   And now they are at least in a really good position.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.600]   And also, maybe their parents say it's OK for you
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.040]   to live at home without paying rent because of COVID.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.520]   So there's a lot of people left because of that.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.880]   There are some people who just had enough money
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.760]   to go and retire early, and they're scared of COVID.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.320]   There's that.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:52.080]   And then on top of all this, again,
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.840]   there still is this enormous overhang
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.760]   of this enormous fiscal stimulus, which
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.960]   was accommodated very readily by the Federal Reserve.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.200]   If you go and take a look at how much nominal GDP increased--
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.040]   so basically, from the bottom to about three months ago,
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:10.400]   when I last looked, US nominal GDP increased by 20%.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.040]   This is an astronomical increase in demand.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.200]   I mean, almost unprecedented, actually.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.400]   So normally, what happens during recessions
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.960]   is the government has some contracyclical demand policy
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.000]   to moderate the fall in demand, but there's still
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.480]   a fall in demand during recessions.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.720]   This is one where, actually, the response
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.960]   was so enormous that it greatly overpowered
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   any fall in demand.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.920]   So actually, demand went up, not down.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.000]   So I think that's another thing that's going on,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.760]   is that there's just been this very, very large increase
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.280]   in demand.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.600]   So that means that, again, it's very easy for workers
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.240]   of all kinds, but probably especially, actually,
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.280]   workers that deal with other people face-to-face.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.200]   These are the industries where people are most
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.360]   worried about the COVID.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.880]   And a lot of people say, hey, can I
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.160]   go and get a job where I'm just teleworking,
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.520]   and then I don't have to worry about the disease?
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.480]   And then once people get started doing that,
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:03.840]   there's a lot of desire just to cling to where you were.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.920]   So yeah, so I think that a story is basically wrong.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.640]   There is a rising payoff for IT skills,
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.480]   but this is just one small part of a much larger world.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.840]   I think it's just a big mistake to think of this
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.400]   as the big thing that's happening.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.760]   Rather, there's just a lot of factors going on.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.360]   But anyway, just in terms of description of the facts,
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.840]   the period where the low-skill workers were doing badly
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.560]   was like 1980, 2000.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.920]   And actually, before COVID, it looked
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.440]   like there was a moderate recovery.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.000]   And then since then, it looks like big recovery for them.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.760]   Cool, cool.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.240]   Awesome.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240]   This was a lot of fun, Brian.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.280]   Thanks for coming on.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.200]   Oh, yeah, my pleasure.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.080]   Thank you very much.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.440]   And that book, again, is "Labor Econ Versus the World."
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.080]   And you can get it on Amazon.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.960]   And this is actually the first of a series
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.000]   of eight books of the very best things
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.280]   that I wrote over 17 years.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.840]   You can, by the way, get them all for free in the blog,
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.200]   but then you'll have to sift through thousands of posts.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.280]   So this is where I try to curate them.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.520]   And I organize them by theme.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.960]   So if there's some particular topics you want to see more,
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.320]   you can buy the book on that and get
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.360]   all of what I consider to be the best things I've
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.320]   written on that topic.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.720]   Yeah, and let me add to that that the pricing is incredibly
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   fair on Amazon.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.760]   And yeah--
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.280]   $12 for paperback and $9.99 for the e-book.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:19.760]   Right.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.400]   And then, yeah, I love the format
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.680]   of these sorts of essay compilations, where you can--
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.600]   it makes it really easy to binge read them,
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.160]   just a couple of pages at a time.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.040]   And then it's a great way to compartmentalize thoughts.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.560]   So yeah, I highly recommend the book.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.400]   All right, thanks for coming.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.960]   Let me give a shout out to the two groups that
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.040]   gave me the idea for this.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.160]   So Les Rong put out a little gift box of little books
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160]   of their best essays.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.480]   And I got one, and I really liked it.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.880]   And I read a lot of stuff that I wouldn't normally
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.840]   have read, because I have these little hard copy books.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.480]   And then actually, my friend Mike Humer
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.800]   decided to self-publish an intro philosophy textbook.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.000]   It was on knowledge, reality, and value.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.080]   And when he told me-- and I asked him,
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.080]   what was the opinion of the next?
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.360]   And no, it was super easy.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.360]   And so that was the one that said, OK, well,
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.600]   why don't I try this, see what happens.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.480]   And then I got the idea of doing eight books.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.560]   So next one will probably be out in like two months, say.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.360]   Oh, cool, cool.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.160]   That one will be Voters as Mad Scientists, essays on--
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.880]   or no, no, no, actually--
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.200]   in fact, it will be How Evil Are Politicians?
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.200]   Essays on Demagoguery.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.560]   That will be the second one.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.080]   Ah, I see.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.400]   OK, looking forward to it.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.020]   All right, thanks a lot, Amrit Vorkesh.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:22.760]   Talk to you later.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.620]   you
