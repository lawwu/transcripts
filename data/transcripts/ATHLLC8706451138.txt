[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.960]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.920]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.500]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited for today's episode
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.880]   because it's with my friend
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.040]   and now third time "All The Hacks" guest, Sahil Bloom.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.380]   This time we're in person at the studio
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.760]   I built in my office,
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.380]   which has been so much fun to use
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.040]   for these in-person episodes.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.600]   If you don't know Sahil, he's one of my favorite writers
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.100]   and the lessons he shares online
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.220]   are some of the best on the internet.
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.340]   So today we're gonna tackle an area
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.060]   he's written a lot about, paradoxes,
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.180]   which are seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statements
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.340]   that when investigated or explained
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060]   may actually prove to be well-founded or true.
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.660]   I love this topic because I believe that so many
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.580]   of the most important truths in our life
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.280]   actually do appear contradictory
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.940]   or convoluted on the surface.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.660]   We're not only gonna share some of our favorite paradoxes,
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.140]   but we'll also cover how you can turn these paradoxes
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.200]   to your advantage to live your best and most optimized life.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.620]   Oh, and one quick update.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.140]   Last week I shared that I was gonna put
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500]   my personal 150,000 point welcome bonus referral link
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500]   for the Amex Platinum in the show notes,
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.420]   except that it turns out I didn't have one like I thought.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.760]   So I reached out to our amazing All The Hacks members
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.020]   and managed to find a few working links.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.500]   So if you're looking for that bonus,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.820]   you can find it at allthehacks.com/platinum.
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.700]   Going forward, I'm gonna solicit members
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.080]   for all their referral links
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140]   whenever there are amazing offers
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.740]   and share them with you all.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740]   So stay tuned for the next one.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.780]   And if you're interested in having your referral link
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.540]   be part of the rotation or just becoming a member,
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.220]   you can do that at allthehacks.com/join.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.060]   Okay, I am so excited for this episode with Sahil.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.360]   Let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.620]   There is no shortage of helpful AI tools out there,
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.700]   but using them means switching back and forth
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.740]   between yet another digital tool.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800]   So instead of simplifying your workflow,
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.220]   it sometimes just gets more complicated.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.820]   Unless of course you're in Notion
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.900]   who I'm excited to partner with today.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.460]   Notion is an amazing product I use every day
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.660]   that combines your notes, docs, and projects
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.140]   into one space that's simple and beautifully designed.
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.240]   And you can leverage the power of AI right inside Notion
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.220]   across all your information without a separate AI tool.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.420]   I've used it to find information from old notes,
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.260]   answer questions about a marketing plan,
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.940]   or even find my travel details, all in seconds.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.920]   I love the features Notion keeps shipping,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.660]   and it just reinforces our decision
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.140]   to use it as the central place we manage our life and work.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.300]   And the fully integrated Notion AI
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.500]   helps you work faster, write better, and think bigger,
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.180]   doing tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.740]   So try Notion AI for free

[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.500]   - Sahil, thanks for being here.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.020]   - Glad to be back, and in the new home studio even better.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.780]   - I know, we're building the sauna out front,
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.420]   and the construction has been paused
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.140]   for two hours for us to record.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.100]   - Next time I come here,
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.260]   I expect to do a sauna episode though.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.460]   Sauna cold plunge?
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.380]   - Yeah, one too.
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.940]   The company building the sauna,
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.180]   everyone will hear about it later.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.300]   It's called Haven Sauna, and it's gonna be really nice.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.100]   They're doing really great work.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.820]   But next time we'll do it.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.540]   It's always trouble to narrow down the scope
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.660]   of these conversations,
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.860]   because you've written about so much,
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.220]   and I'm an avid reader of yours.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.100]   But I was thinking about the topic today,
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.580]   and I thought there is one topic
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.900]   that you've written about on Twitter
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.500]   that has actually led to tremendous amazement
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.380]   of a lunch with a billionaire.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.100]   So maybe we just start with what is that topic,
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.700]   and why should we talk about it?
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.420]   - So I think what you're alluding to,
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.300]   because it's the only one, is the topic of paradoxes.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.380]   And the funny story around all of this,
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.940]   and the lunch with the billionaire story,
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.820]   goes back to, let's see, November of 2021,
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.780]   I wrote my first, this was like a Twitter thread,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.260]   on the topic of paradoxes.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.180]   So basically, a paradox is like a seemingly absurd
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.820]   or contradictory statement
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.300]   that once you actually dig into it and investigate it,
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.420]   may actually prove true.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.140]   I wrote a sort of curation of like 20
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.580]   of my favorite paradoxes
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.340]   that I feel like I've come across in my own life,
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.540]   or that I've struggled with on a regular basis,
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.380]   and shared it.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.300]   And it went pretty viral at the time,
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.580]   probably had like 60 or so thousand likes,
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.820]   reached tons of people, et cetera, went away.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.740]   Just like most things do on Twitter,
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.740]   you know, it's kind of an ephemeral platform.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.220]   Once something has like buzzed for 24 hours,
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.940]   it sort of disappears into the ether and it's gone forever.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.580]   So fast forward to January, 2023,
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.740]   I am in India visiting my grandmother,
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.340]   and I wake up in the morning to a bunch of texts
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.700]   from friends saying like,
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.180]   "Whoa, Bill Ackman shared your tweet thread."
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.180]   So I expect like,
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.140]   "Oh, it's some recent thing that I've written, that's cool."
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.540]   I pop it open and I look,
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.300]   and he has quote tweeted this thread from November, 2021,
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.940]   saying, "A friend sent me this last week.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.700]   It contains tons of wisdom, everyone should read it."
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.740]   And so I'm the big like shoot your shot guy.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.780]   I talk about that a lot.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.260]   Closed mouths don't get fed,
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.140]   it's like one of my mantras on life.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.500]   So I reply to his tweet and say,
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.220]   "Thanks for sharing my work, Bill.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.900]   We should get lunch in New York sometime on me."
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.740]   Kind of tongue in cheek, like he's a billionaire,
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.700]   I'm obviously not, I'll pay for lunch.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.780]   And he replies and says, "Would love to do that."
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.020]   And so we DM, coordinate,
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.140]   and I ended up getting to have lunch with Bill Ackman
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.500]   as a result of this Twitter thread
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.460]   that I had written 18 months before, whatever it was.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.660]   Unbelievable serendipity,
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.900]   and also a perfect example of the luck raiser,
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.180]   which I feel like we talked about on our last episode
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.260]   of expanding your luck surface area
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.980]   and how content is a great, great example of that.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.140]   Like you put something out into the world
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.820]   and it's still creating lucky encounters for you
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.020]   18 months into the future.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.740]   So I can't promise that anyone listening
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.780]   is gonna be able to use this content
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.180]   to have lunch with a billionaire, but maybe, maybe.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.260]   But I can promise that the value you get from it's tremendous
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.820]   because I've gotten it.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.740]   So what I thought we'd do,
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.900]   similar to the last time when we talked about raisers,
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.460]   was just kind of run through
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.820]   what I thought were some of my favorites.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.460]   If I miss some, you can bring them up.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.780]   And I've kind of grouped them into a few categories.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.380]   And so maybe talk really briefly why paradoxes,
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.340]   what attracted you to write about this?
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.860]   - Like for me, when I think about content more broadly
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.980]   and the content that I create,
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.260]   my whole goal is not to provide answers
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.620]   to questions for people.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.900]   You know, I don't sit down and think
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.220]   that I am some unbelievably wise or intelligent person
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.260]   that has all the answers
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.900]   to how to live your life in a better way.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.420]   What I do know is that I spend a lot of time
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.980]   thinking about problems and thinking about struggles
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.620]   that I've encountered in my own life
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.860]   and about tensions and balance points
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.980]   and all these different areas.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.740]   Paradoxes contain a lot of that.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.060]   Like when you think about something
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.500]   that looks on the surface one way,
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.060]   but in reality, it's another way,
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.020]   that's fundamentally what we're talking about here.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.860]   And that's life.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.540]   And so I thought the paradoxes piece and my writing on it
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.380]   was like a great encapsulation
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.460]   of how you actually encounter challenges
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.860]   and struggle in your own life.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.060]   It's not about coming up with the right answer.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.580]   It's about asking the right question
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.940]   and about struggling with it
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.100]   slightly better than you were previously.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.940]   And so that's like,
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.900]   that's always been my attempt with writing about it.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.740]   And hopefully what has come across
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.900]   and why it's resonated with people when I have.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.900]   - It's funny, I think when you just started saying that,
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.180]   it made me click why I appreciate your content so much.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.100]   What I do is actually probably the exact opposite.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.020]   I'm like, I am going to do all the research
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.420]   on all the cell phone plans in the country,
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.860]   except for Xfinity Mobile,
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.380]   which a few of you have reached out and said,
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.220]   "Sorry, I left it off the list."
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.300]   I guess that my hatred of Comcast kind of came to fruition
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.260]   with the goal of like,
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.060]   can I narrow down all the information
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.900]   so you can actually just make a decision?
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.820]   And I think your style of content is like,
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.260]   let me give you a bunch of information
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.860]   that you can use to think differently.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.660]   And maybe mine is that you can use to do differently.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.900]   - I mean, your content,
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.380]   there's sort of like two areas, right?
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.420]   Your content is answerable.
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.180]   Like there is a specific answer that you can research
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.260]   and give someone the best answer to definitively
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.060]   the type of questions you are wrestling with.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.260]   The questions I'm wrestling with are like,
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.900]   how to live your life better
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.780]   or how to live in a slightly healthier or wealthier way.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.420]   And there's no one size fits all to that.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.060]   I can research it all I want.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.340]   I can go talk to like 90 year olds, 80 year olds,
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.660]   learn all that I can.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.700]   But the reality is that everyone's life situation
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.540]   is different.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.340]   Everyone's in a different season of their own life.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.820]   And so what the correct answer for you at age 20,
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.660]   when you're starting out
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.500]   is not the correct answer for you at age 40 or may not be.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.820]   And so my whole perspective is like,
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.020]   I always need to navigate and avoid being like
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.260]   overly definitive and providing an answer
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.140]   and reconcile the fact that I'm 32.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.420]   Like I don't have all the answers.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.140]   I'm not a 95 year old old wise monk
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.700]   living in the mountains of the Himalayas
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.340]   telling you that I've like learned the secret to life.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.260]   What I do know is that I spend a whole lot of time
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.460]   thinking about these things
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.540]   and that I have a way where I can sort of disseminate them
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.660]   and hopefully like a clear and concise way
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.340]   that helps people navigate them in their own lives.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.940]   - Is 2024 bringing exciting or unexpected changes
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.780]   to your life?
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.060]   Here's a secret weapon to help you face those challenges
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.300]   with more confidence.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.420]   A great term life insurance policy.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.460]   Yes, really.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.700]   Our sponsor today, Fabric by Gerber Life
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.860]   makes it simple to protect your family's financial future

[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.020]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents

[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.700]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.140]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.500]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.980]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.860]   for less than a dollar a day.

[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.460]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.060]   not available in certain states,
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.740]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.600]   There is nothing better than finding a brand of clothing
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.220]   that's comfortable, functional, and looks good.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.860]   And that's exactly how I feel
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.940]   about our sponsor today, Viore.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.140]   If you saw me in person, you'd know I believe it
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.100]   because there are very few days that go by
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.500]   where I'm not wearing one, two,
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.580]   or even three pieces of Viore.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.960]   They make performance apparel for men and women
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.660]   that's incredibly versatile.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.380]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.660]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.960]   And it is so comfortable,
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.740]   you'll wanna wear it all the time.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.960]   I've long said that Sunday performance joggers
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.740]   were my favorites, and don't get me wrong,
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.300]   I have at least three pairs,
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.520]   and they are the most comfortable pants I've owned,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.860]   but I've been running a lot more,
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.580]   and it's still warm in California,
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.500]   so I'm wearing my core shorts all the time.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.340]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.380]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.620]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.660]   but they're also great for lounging and running around town.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.420]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.740]   and for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.660]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.260]   At the risk of taking too much advice,
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.900]   let's jump into the paradoxes,
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.380]   let's talk about the advice paradox.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.220]   Good transition.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.500]   Yeah, I feel like advice isn't what it might seem.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.500]   Yeah, I mean, the advice paradox is the idea
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.780]   that we all get and receive a whole lot of advice
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.960]   over the course of our lives.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.820]   Most of it is complete garbage.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.540]   And the more advice you take,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.060]   the less well-informed you actually are.
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.980]   And this is something that's counterintuitive.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.900]   You think like, "Oh, I'm just starting out in my life.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.500]   "I need to go and get tons of advice
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.660]   "from all these different people."
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.900]   And the reality is that for them,
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.900]   most of their maps that they're going to provide you with,
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.180]   the advice that they provide you being the map,
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.860]   are not going to match the terrain of your life.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.780]   Your life is fundamentally very different
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.380]   than whatever it is you're going to encounter.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.700]   Nassim Taleb talks about this idea of the noise bottleneck
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.540]   in some of his work, which basically says that
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.740]   you assume that by consuming more,
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.780]   you're going to get more signal as a result.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.060]   But the reality is that by consuming more,
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.340]   and in this case, consuming more advice,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.740]   the ratio of noise to signal actually increases over time.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.100]   And so what you're left with is a worse idea
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.660]   of what the overall answer is.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.380]   And I really feel that way with advice.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.060]   When you go out and get too much advice,
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.940]   you get too many different perspectives,
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.740]   you actually leave feeling like,
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.460]   "Oh my God, I'm completely overwhelmed,
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.980]   "and I have no idea what the answer is to this problem."
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.780]   And so the real key then is figuring out
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.020]   how to take some of the signal
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.820]   from what you get out in the world,
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   narrow down to the things that are really high signal
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.620]   and the people that are really providing
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.460]   the tightest and crispest, if that's a word, advice,
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.860]   and leave all the noise, you know,
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.300]   get rid of all that other noise
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.540]   that might exist in the world.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.940]   - So is it more about seeking less advice
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.220]   or more about when you seek that advice,
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.700]   knowing how to process what you learn?
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:09.660]   - I think it's both.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.540]   On the seeking less advice,
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.380]   that really comes from curating who you seek out for advice.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.860]   Seeking advice from people who have really experienced
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.380]   the thing that you are going through
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.940]   or have navigated in the way that you want to navigate it,
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.060]   narrowing it down to just those people is really important.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.780]   And then realizing that no one has
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.300]   the ultimate answer for you.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.620]   If I want to go start a business,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.980]   I can't just go to Elon Musk and assume
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.020]   that he's going to have the perfect advice for me
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.460]   in my career where I am, right?
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.940]   Because survivorship bias plays a role.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.260]   He might've just gotten lucky.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.580]   - And he and you are very different people.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.660]   - Yeah, and you know, very, very different people
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.740]   and want different things
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.260]   and have different balance points in our life.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.460]   And there's so many differences.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.620]   And yet most people, when they go to do that,
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.100]   they go read a bunch of books on business and say like,
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.020]   "Oh, well, Elon Musk bet it all
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.500]   "after he sold his shares in PayPal
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.460]   "and like pushed all the chips back in the table
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.300]   "and it worked out for him.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.220]   "Now he's the richest man in the world.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.820]   "So I'm going to just keep betting it all."
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.820]   And then you go bankrupt and you wonder why.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.220]   So, you know, survivorship bias plays a real role
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.620]   in how advice is given.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.700]   Like we take advice from the victors
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.260]   and that's a dangerous thing too.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.460]   It's funny 'cause we're both working on books
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.860]   and mine is kind of at the highest level principles
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.260]   for better outcomes.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.260]   And the first one is that conventional wisdom sucks.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.460]   And I think when I think about the advice paradox,
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.380]   I think about conventional wisdom.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.620]   And I think the most common piece of conventional wisdom
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.420]   that I hear so many people talk about
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.820]   when it comes to money and wealth
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.460]   is that real estate is the best way to build wealth.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.620]   I'm sure you've heard this.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.100]   Maybe people in your family believe it.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.900]   And for me, it's like, it is a way
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.780]   and it happened to have worked for someone.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.980]   And then they translate that it to being the best.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.500]   But who knows if they actually did the research
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.660]   ahead of time to pick that consciously
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.220]   or if it's just the thing that worked.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.940]   Conventional wisdom is an interesting thing.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.900]   It's sort of like all of these like,
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.620]   have you heard of Chesterton's fence?
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.020]   Like this idea that if you don't know why a fence is there,
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.620]   you should figure out why it's there
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.100]   before tearing it down.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.700]   I think about that a lot with things like this
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.860]   because so like the example is like,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.020]   there's this fence and you think it's really stupid
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.940]   that it's there and you go tear it down
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.540]   because you can't figure out why it's there.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.980]   It might've been that it was holding back
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.740]   a whole bunch of wolves that you didn't know existed
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.140]   because the fence was holding it back
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.820]   and then you go tear it down and your whole town
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.020]   gets eaten by a bunch of wolves that are let in.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.460]   And so like with stuff like this,
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.020]   like with conventional wisdom,
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.980]   I just always seek to figure out why is it there?
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.980]   Like before saying that it doesn't work
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.340]   or that it's incorrect, I wanna know like,
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.020]   well, what created the situation
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.020]   where that became conventional wisdom?
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.260]   So like before you dispel the notion, figure out why.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.020]   And then it might be that it was incorrect.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.980]   With Chesterton's fence, the whole idea is like,
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.980]   no one puts up a fence just for the fun of it.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.380]   So they put it up for a reason.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.140]   You need to figure out why before you go and tear it down.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.020]   - It's funny, I chose conventional wisdom sucks,
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.060]   not conventional wisdom is wrong.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.220]   Intentionally, 'cause I'm like,
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.940]   it just sucks that people often give it
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.020]   as if it should apply to everyone.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.900]   It's not that it's wrong.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.220]   It's just that you might not be in the same situation
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.420]   as your parents were.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.260]   And so their advice might not apply.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.740]   - And most people blindly give it
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.260]   because it's repeated ad nauseum.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.100]   And so most people will continue to perpetuate
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.500]   whatever the conventional wisdom is
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.820]   because it's easy to do
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.700]   without actually having thought about it
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.140]   on a first principles basis.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.460]   And so when you ask them like,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.300]   well, why should I own real estate?
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.940]   And they go to start explaining it,
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.340]   it's like the emperor has no clothes.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.540]   There's nothing underneath the surface of that question
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.380]   when you ask them.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.220]   So we're in the topic of life.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.220]   Let's talk about the opportunity paradox,
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.900]   which funny enough, as I read through,
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.620]   you've written about paradoxes multiple times,
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.340]   used to be called the say no paradox has evolved.
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.460]   It's the evolution of probably of my writing,
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.940]   'cause I think the opportunity paradox
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.900]   has a better ring to it than say no.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.540]   The idea here with the opportunity paradox
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.780]   is you need to take on less to accomplish more.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.260]   So when I was young and probably when you were young,
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.660]   probably a lot of your listeners,
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.420]   you assume that you need to just take on every single thing.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.060]   If you want to accomplish great things,
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.460]   you need to just say yes to things
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.780]   over and over and over again.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.260]   I think that is true to an extent early in your life
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.820]   because saying yes expands your luck surface area,
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.780]   you get exposed to different things out there.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.060]   But at a certain point,
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.900]   what you really need to do is take on less
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.380]   and you need to take on less but better
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.460]   to use the Greg McKeown thing from essentialism.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.660]   And this is like a really core trait
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.900]   of how you actually go deeper,
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.700]   how you identify what are those asymmetric opportunities
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.700]   that exist and how you pursue those only.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.380]   There's another paradox, you have the boredom paradox,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.220]   which I kind of feel like might fit into
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.500]   if you have extra time because you haven't filled your day.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.500]   Would you say that these kind of pair well?
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.500]   Around all of these, it's sort of free time is a good thing.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.180]   This is like one of what I would consider
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.300]   the most significant lies we've all been told,
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.500]   which is that free time is bad.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.780]   The reality in my mind is that free time
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.300]   is a call option on future interesting opportunities.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.340]   What I mean by that is that when you have free time
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.460]   in your schedule, you have the headspace
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.660]   and you have the actual time and bandwidth
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.980]   to go pursue the really high upside,
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.260]   asymmetric opportunities that come into your life.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.700]   If your day is just back to back meetings,
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.660]   chock full from start to finish,
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.380]   where are you gonna pursue the interesting thing
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.220]   that might come your way?
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.380]   You're just gonna have to say no to it
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.180]   because you literally don't have time
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.820]   and you don't have the headspace to think about it.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.700]   I think about that all the time when I'm stressed
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.700]   'cause I'm running from thing to thing to thing.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.060]   My response when I see a text or an email
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.740]   that might offer me something or ask me to do something
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.020]   is like default no, because I'm overwhelmed.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.020]   I'm stressed and I just wanna get things out of the way.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.740]   Arthur Brooks calls it ventilating your schedule,
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.900]   like breathing some air into your schedule
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.900]   is a great way to spark creativity
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.060]   so that you can actually go and identify
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.180]   what those asymmetric opportunities are.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.380]   The things where one unit of input
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.900]   is creating 10, 100, 1,000 X units of output.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.700]   - And if you don't have a thing to come back to boredom,
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.700]   it's like actually being bored can be valuable.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.100]   - Yeah, I mean, look at, this is a silly example.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.900]   Look at how Lionel Messi plays soccer.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.060]   Watch him on a soccer field.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.580]   This is one of the things that announcers
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.300]   have bemoaned about him throughout his career.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.860]   He walks around the pitch all the time
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.860]   and to the untrained eye, it looks like he's bored.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.180]   I mean, during the World Cup final,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.540]   he's like walking around in the latter seconds of that match,
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.420]   just like sort of aimlessly looking around
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.740]   and walking around.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.140]   And then all of a sudden he bursts into action
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.780]   and deploys all of his energy into a single moment
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.580]   where he knows there isn't 1,000 X upside potential
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.260]   in that moment and scores one of the game winning goals.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.940]   And that is like the perfect example to me.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.500]   You can be bored and then really deploy all of your energy
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.380]   into those 1,000 X opportunities
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.580]   that offer that asymmetric upside.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.940]   - Also watching Lionel Messi not moving around
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.340]   probably fits into the effort paradox as well,
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.020]   because I think he knows what he's doing.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.740]   - Yes, he definitely knows what he's doing.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.540]   - And maybe as we hit each one, feel free to recap them.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.140]   - Yeah, but he definitely knows what he's doing.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.640]   The effort paradox, athletes are the best with this one.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.620]   So I totally agree with you.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.500]   The effort paradox is the idea that you have to put in
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.460]   more effort in order for something to appear effortless.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.320]   The idea that effortless, elegant performances
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.300]   are really just the result of thousands and thousands
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.820]   of hours of effortful practice.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.580]   Watching Roger Federer play tennis in his prime,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.620]   if you're a tennis fan, is a perfect example of this.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.300]   Like his strokes just look completely effortless,
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.580]   but they're the result of thousands and thousands of hours
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.020]   of compounded, effortful practice.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.080]   There's this phrase, which I might butcher
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.380]   the pronunciation of, sprezzatura,
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.680]   which is an Italian phrase,
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.660]   I think from like the 15th century,
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.580]   a guy by the name of Baldassare Castiglione
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.340]   who wrote this book called The Book of the Courtier.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.580]   And the whole book was about how to be an ideal courtier,
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.900]   like a person of the court in these royal courts.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.100]   And he basically said that an ideal courtier
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.420]   should walk with a sprezzatura,
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.700]   which he defines as like a studied nonchalance,
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.140]   meaning it appears effortless,
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.900]   but there is a studied element to it.
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.140]   Like you've worked so hard to make something appear
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.020]   effortless in the way that you walk.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.300]   And that is the goal that all of us are pursuing.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.820]   That's like reaching that level
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.300]   of unconscious competence in something
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.100]   where you can just do it and make it appear
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.420]   completely effortless to do the thing.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.300]   That's kind of the pursuit that we're all on
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.980]   in whatever our field or craft is,
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.860]   is to reach that level of elegance in the way that we move.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.500]   - I mean, I don't know if you've seen Free Solo,
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.340]   but my sport that I've done. - Yeah, of course.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.620]   He's a perfect example of it.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.300]   - I've rock climbed for a long time,
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.780]   and the ability to make rock climbing look natural
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.500]   is so much practice.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.620]   And it's also a great sport to take someone
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.900]   who is very, very in shape,
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.620]   but has never been rock climbing,
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.500]   if you want to feel good about yourself.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   - So you're going to take me rock climbing sometime?
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.460]   I get invited to do a lot of rock climbing,
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.380]   and I always hesitate because it scares me.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.020]   But Alex Honnold is someone that I would love to meet someday
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.540]   because just the way that his mind works around these things
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.660]   is just fascinating.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.460]   - A venture firm that I raised money from
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.780]   had a private event with Alex Honnold a couple of weeks ago,
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.460]   and it was really awesome to have like a small group,
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.100]   non-recorded closed door conversation.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.140]   He is a fascinating individual.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.780]   - The cinematography in that movie is otherworldly.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.180]   I think it was Jimmy Lee, or no, it's Jimmy Chan.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.980]   Jimmy Chan is the guy that does it,
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.220]   who's an unbelievable climber himself.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.180]   You know, and for the whole team
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.540]   to be able to actually get those shots,
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.100]   unbelievable climbers, yeah, that movie's incredible.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.460]   - I just assume people have seen it,
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.460]   but if you haven't, strong, strong recommendation.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.300]   - Drop everything.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.220]   It's like a drop everything and watch that movie.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.980]   Unless you're like terribly afraid of heights,
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.180]   in which case you might get kind of triggered by it.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.260]   - I took a friend of mine rock climbing once.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.660]   There's probably some paradox or lesson in this.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.340]   I assumed that he would know that climbing gear is safe,
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.500]   but he'd never been climbing.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.180]   And so we were in Australia,
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.900]   and we did a five-pitch climb in the Blue Mountains,
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.740]   which is basically--
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.580]   - What does five-pitch mean?
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.420]   - Five-pitch is you climb up,
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.180]   and then you pull your gear and your ropes,
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.020]   and then you climb again.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.860]   - Okay, there's like five stages.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.700]   - So there's like five stages.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.740]   And this is where you're like setting your gear in the rock.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.580]   Like you're taking a thing, pushing it between a crack,
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.340]   and trusting that it will hold you.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.740]   Having done it myself, I'm like, yeah, that works.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.780]   My friend had never rock climbed,
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.540]   and we weren't doing necessarily a hard climb.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.500]   If we were in a gym,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.100]   it would have been a walk in the park for everyone.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.420]   But we're like up on this wall,
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.820]   and it never crossed my mind
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.540]   that he might not trust all of this stuff.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.340]   And I just remember by the end, I had a GoPro on.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.540]   He was just cursing me.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.900]   He was so mad, but there's nothing he could do
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.500]   'cause we're halfway up the wall.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.780]   There's just no option.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.540]   - I mean, I'm kind of with your friend on this.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.340]   Like on all of these things,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.540]   I'm not like a big risk taker in general.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.980]   So like when I have friends that do these kinds of things,
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.940]   I'm like, dude, you have kids.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.780]   Why are you doing that?
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.420]   Like, you know, even scuba diving.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.700]   I'm like, dude, why are you scuba diving?
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.540]   Don't scuba dive.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.900]   Just like go snorkeling.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.980]   You're on the top of the water.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.820]   You're totally fine.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.260]   Like do you really need to get into the fishes environment
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.740]   and like be down there in their house?
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.860]   Like they don't want you there either.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.980]   Just chill on the top.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.540]   You don't have like a pressurized tank of oxygen
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.380]   on your back.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.380]   Like you're totally fine if something goes wrong.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.940]   I never understood why people wanna go do these things.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.780]   - It's funny.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.540]   Scuba diving for me actually was one where
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.420]   I just feel like if you do it enough,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.340]   I just kind of, I mean, get bored with it, I guess.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.940]   It's like, oh, I've seen a lot of these things.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.140]   So it's fallen off.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:23:59.980]   - Yeah.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.300]   Then you're like, oh, well now I need to scuba dive
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.060]   in like shark chummed waters.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.340]   Like, so now I need to go do this.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.940]   It's like, okay, well, then if you get bit by a shark,
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.940]   I'm not gonna feel bad for you if you decided to go do that.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.400]   - I will put an endorsement in,
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.860]   which you probably won't take.
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.900]   In Hawaii, there is pelagic shark diving
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.340]   where it's just snorkeling with sharks.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.420]   So you're kind of free diving and snorkeling
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.780]   in the shark's environment with a marine biologist
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.860]   who knows what they're doing.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.700]   But it's like--
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.380]   - What do you mean they know what they're doing?
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.100]   Like they're gonna wrestle the shark if the shark comes?
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.180]   Like that makes no sense.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.700]   Why would you, just to see a shark?
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.940]   - It was actually really fascinating
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.180]   because it was kind of like go get a lesson about sharks
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.060]   and be in their environment.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.660]   And I guess it's not control, right?
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.940]   You're in the water with the shark.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.820]   - Like what do you do if the shark just comes at you?
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.180]   You just try to run away?
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.820]   Like you're swimming.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.220]   - She had like a pole.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.760]   - Oh, that's really gonna stop a shark.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.900]   That sounds great.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.740]   That sounds like fun.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.100]   - In this case, there was one shark and she's like,
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.060]   well, there's one shark with a lazy eye.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.180]   It's very docile.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.620]   If it comes towards you, don't be too worried.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.460]   And so--
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.500]   - It's got a lazy eye.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.980]   - So this shark would swim near people
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.620]   and she'd just kind of like bop it on the nose
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.460]   and it would swim away.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.580]   But I thought, you probably won't take me up on it,
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.580]   but it's on either the Big Island or Maui.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.500]   I can't remember which island.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.860]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.580]   But we did this shark and it was amazing.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.660]   - I'm just gonna stick to watching National Geographic.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.220]   I'm gonna get my like Apple Vision+ immersive experience.
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.020]   It'll basically be like I was in the water with you guys,
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.540]   except without the shark potentially eating me.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.460]   - Okay, fair.
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.140]   - Let's get back on track.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.260]   Let's go to the talking paradox.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.380]   I have a couple anecdotes here that came up recently.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.220]   - All right. - Go for it.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.140]   - Basic idea with the talking paradox
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.100]   is if you want your ideas to be heard,
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.220]   you should listen twice as much as you speak.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.220]   And again, it's counter to what you would think,
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.220]   which is the more I talk,
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.900]   the more I push my ideas out there.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.900]   If I'm in a room, I need to be the loudest one.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.980]   I need to get my ideas heard, completely counter to that.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.300]   The people that you actually listen to the most
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.860]   are the people that listen a whole lot.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.700]   When they do speak, it is incredibly pointed,
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.900]   interesting, insightful speaking.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.980]   There's some quote, I'm gonna forget who it is.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.460]   Maybe it's Epictetus.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.220]   You have two ears and one mouth.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.700]   You need to use them accordingly.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.660]   And it's very true.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.620]   Something that I think of a lot in group events,
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.180]   at retreats, at different things that I go to.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.780]   The person that I inevitably leave being most impressed by
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.260]   is the person who said very few words,
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.580]   but when they did speak, it was unbelievably poignant.
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.780]   - There was a partner at Google Ventures, Joe Krause,
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.540]   who's one of the, I guess I'll call him,
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.460]   wisest people I know.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.540]   And he had this thing where he didn't talk much.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.140]   And then when he did, right before,
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.060]   he'd kind of put his hands together like this,
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.580]   and we'd all be sitting in the room.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.100]   - That's like a common thread, by the way.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.180]   I feel like they always are like, okay.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.100]   It's like the Yoda.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.540]   - And I just remember we were all sitting around the room,
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.340]   and then all of a sudden you'd see Joe put his hands up,
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.140]   and I would be like, quiet down and listen intently.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.460]   And I'm curious.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.820]   I feel like this should be a goal for mine.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.540]   I guess being a podcaster makes it hard to be like,
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.380]   oh, I should talk less.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.060]   But do you feel like you do this well?
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.700]   And if so, how much are you thinking
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.700]   about what you're saying?
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.980]   Because to go back to Arthur Brooks,
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.020]   he has this whole concept of crystallized intelligence.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.260]   And as you grow in your professional life,
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.220]   you've built up such a wealth of knowledge.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.500]   I feel like sometimes it can be easy
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.860]   to just speak off the cuff.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.660]   Do you have any tips for kind of restraining
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.660]   to really hone and focus when you kind of know the answer,
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.740]   but if you took a minute, you could piece together
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.580]   an even more profound response?
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.980]   - To answer your first question,
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.860]   I think I'm improving at it,
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.500]   but it doesn't come natural to me.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.780]   I'm a storyteller naturally.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.700]   I love telling stories, embellishing stories,
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.460]   like in locker rooms, like that was always my thing.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.540]   I was like always the loud one in that way.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.380]   And I need to force myself to go into
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.820]   what I call listen mode,
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.380]   which is like when you're around people,
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.020]   especially people that have different views than you,
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.180]   you really need to make an effort
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.140]   to listen twice as much as you speak.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.140]   And it's really hard to do,
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.020]   'cause when someone says something you don't agree with,
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.340]   your first reaction is like,
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.780]   let me jump in there and contest it.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.660]   Let me tell you why you're wrong, et cetera.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.540]   And you learn a whole lot more about the world,
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.780]   about yourself, about the other person,
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.420]   by defaulting to listening in those situations,
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.940]   because no one believes something for no reason.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.300]   When someone has a belief, when someone has a perspective,
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.700]   when there's a fence sitting there,
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.660]   there's always a reason that the fence is there.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.220]   So I think it's something that
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.300]   I definitely need to improve on.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.460]   I think we all probably need to improve on.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.380]   Your second question on ways and tips and heuristics,
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.740]   I think that it's just that.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.260]   When you're in a situation and you're listening,
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.860]   actually make sure you're listening to the person,
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.180]   not formulating your response in the moment.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.980]   I think there's a point in time
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.500]   when you've kind of gotten the gist
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.620]   of what someone is saying.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.660]   When you turn to, okay, now I'm listening,
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.260]   but I'm also creating the narrative
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.980]   of what I'm gonna say in my mind.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.540]   But it's usually later than you think.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.180]   Most people, I think, stop listening very, very quickly
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.100]   in someone's dialogue.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.420]   Like even when we're having a podcast conversation,
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.860]   you notice, if you start becoming aware of it,
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.860]   at what point in the person speaking
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.860]   are you starting to think about
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.700]   what you're gonna say next?
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.380]   Like you right now, you're probably thinking about like,
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.740]   okay, what am I gonna say next?
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.220]   Because it's the natural way that a conversation goes.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.780]   Learning to like uncomfortably push that back a little bit
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.580]   and listen a little bit longer,
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.740]   I find that you learn a lot more from the other person.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.940]   And then as a result,
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.020]   you end up coming up with more insightful responses
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.340]   that sort of drive conversations forward.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.180]   Sometimes when you're in the moment like this,
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.180]   I'm not always the best at listening
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.780]   'cause I'm trying to plan the conversation
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.860]   and it's a little bit my responsibility and job even.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.300]   But there's a Stanford professor, Matt Abrahams,
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.580]   his episode will be coming out.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.340]   By the time you hear this, you'll have heard it,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.300]   but it comes out, I think next week.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.220]   And he's written a bunch of books on impromptu speaking
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.340]   and how to become more natural at it.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.400]   And by becoming more natural at it,
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.260]   you can feel more confident pushing back the point
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.060]   at which you start thinking of what you're gonna say.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:34.900]   - That's interesting.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.180]   I read an article recently
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.420]   on ways to become a better conversationalist,
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.460]   which I thought was really interesting
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.940]   because it's such an important trait,
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.420]   being a good conversationalist,
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.940]   that you don't really ever study, read about, think about.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.820]   And it was written by an improv,
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.260]   like a person that is an expert at improv,
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.620]   which is an unbelievable skill.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.900]   Like if you've never done it,
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.380]   gone to an improv class, et cetera,
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.540]   it's a great way to get better at public speaking,
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.500]   to get better at conversations, et cetera.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.660]   And what he talks about, like his mental model,
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.980]   his framework for improving as a conversationalist,
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.260]   it's all about creating what he calls doorknobs
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.420]   in conversations.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.620]   You say something that is a doorknob
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.500]   that someone else can open and walk through.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.420]   Like you're not asking them necessarily a direct question,
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.860]   but you're making statements that are inviting someone
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.540]   to open the doorknob and walk through the door.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.380]   The article is great,
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.460]   we should link to it in the show notes,
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.140]   but it's got a whole bunch of really interesting examples
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.020]   of that, like in an improv context
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.140]   of how you create a doorknob
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.180]   rather than just like making a statement
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.660]   or doing something that closes off a conversation.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.140]   - It's funny 'cause it might be the same person,
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.500]   I don't remember the name,
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.620]   but after I did this interview with Matt,
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.460]   he sent me a list and he was like,
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.300]   "Here are a few people
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.140]   that I think would be great for your show."
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.340]   And I was like, gosh, all of the topics,
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.580]   and mainly 'cause they're mostly other Stanford professors
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.340]   in his department, where one of them was about improv,
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.220]   they were all kind of related to conversational skills.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.740]   And I was like, gosh, I don't know if I'm gonna have
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.140]   four conversational skill episodes in a quarter,
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.300]   but I don't know, it's really important.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.820]   So I'm like, I'm definitely gonna line 'em up.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.820]   So keep an eye out for at least one more in the future.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.860]   - I mean, improv, it's something I wish I had done
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.700]   at a younger age.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.380]   Like I wish I had done an improv class in college.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.340]   Maybe this is very rare,
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.660]   but it was a required class in my middle school.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.500]   So everyone in my middle school-
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.940]   - We had drama, actually, we had to do drama.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.820]   - Yeah, I think, maybe it was drama,
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.900]   but I remember playing like park bench.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.620]   If you ever played park bench, the improv,
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.940]   I don't know what you even call, skit?
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.340]   I don't know what, exercise?
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.660]   We would play it in school.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.240]   I feel like this about a lot of education.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.140]   There's all these things that I was exposed to
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.100]   in middle school, high school, elementary school,
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.820]   that looking back, I'm like,
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.180]   why didn't I like really appreciate what I was doing?
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.700]   At the time, I was like, oh, this is silly.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.140]   And now I'm like, ah, improv, I should have practiced more.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.300]   - That was what I was gonna say is like,
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.340]   I think we had that too.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.540]   We had drama and we had to do stuff like that.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.780]   But I, and I'm sure all of my classmates,
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.900]   were at the time so insecure and so self-conscious
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.740]   that you basically don't take advantage of it.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.260]   Like you're not actually building the skill
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.380]   'cause you're so worried about other people judging you
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.220]   and laughing at you.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.940]   I probably had a bunch of zits on my face
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.480]   and I was probably like, you know,
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.660]   trying to hide from some cute girl that was in the class.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.220]   I didn't want to embarrass myself.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.660]   And, you know, you're like suffering
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.660]   from the ultimate spotlight effect at that age
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.740]   where you just assume that everyone is staring at you
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.300]   when in reality, everyone is just worried about themselves
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.260]   in that same moment.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.620]   But like, I would love to go take an improv class now.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.020]   Now I might think about doing it.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.580]   I'm sure New York has some of the best improv classes
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:25.420]   in the world.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.580]   I think it'd be really fun at this age
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.980]   where I'm like secure enough to not really care
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.180]   if I'm embarrassing and bad at it.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.500]   - I went to a conference last week in Hawaii
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.980]   and it was atypical in that it was not
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.740]   your standard conference with keynotes
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.760]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.460]   And their thing, which was,
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.080]   there's this thing called The Game.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.900]   And the best I'd describe it is like scavenger hunt
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.420]   meets escape room in groups of five.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.300]   And, you know, you kind of get to know people
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.860]   and you do all these kind of mental challenging exercises.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.220]   But it'd be interesting at the next kind of conference,
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.220]   summit, off-site-y, mastermind, whatever you call it,
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.060]   to just have an improv person come and do a class.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:00.900]   I don't know.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.740]   I know you go to a lot of these events.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.560]   - Yeah. - You probably host
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.400]   some of them. - Yeah.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.900]   - That's maybe a-- - That is a cool idea.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.740]   I like that a lot.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.780]   - I expect an invite.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.040]   - Yeah, you're in.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.080]   Working full-time and raising two kids
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.000]   can often lead to some stressful situations.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.160]   But recently I've been taking the advice I got
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.960]   from comedian Kevin Hart on dropping little tidbits
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.120]   of comedy to release some of that stress and tension.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.760]   And so far, so good.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.480]   And while I haven't actually ever even met Kevin Hart,
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   when I was taking his class on using humor
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.060]   to make your mark, I really felt like I got to know him
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.320]   and what's behind a lot of his success.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.580]   And I did it all from the comfort of my own home
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.840]   with our sponsor today, Masterclass.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.160]   In addition to Kevin Hart,
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.000]   Masterclass offers over 180 world-class instructors.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.180]   So whether you want to master negotiation with Chris Voss,
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.080]   think like a boss with Martha Stewart,
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.160]   or go deeper on mental strength
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.720]   with All The Hacks guest, Robin Arzon,

[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.360]   I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.380]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.320]   but the reality is I'm not.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.520]   But if you're a long-time listener,
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.940]   you might know I've been drinking AG1 for about two years.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.840]   When I started drinking AG1 daily,
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.600]   it was to help with daily nutrition,
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.640]   but I also felt a real difference
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.800]   in the energy I had every day,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.040]   so it's been in my routine ever since.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.600]   And that's because AG1 is
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.680]   a foundational nutrition supplement
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.080]   that supports your body's universal needs
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.440]   like gut optimization, stress management,
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.760]   and immune support.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.580]   Since 2010, AG1 has led the future
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.160]   of foundational nutrition,
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.280]   continuously refining their formula
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.040]   to create a smarter, better way
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.340]   to elevate your baseline health.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.700]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.420]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.460]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.080]   and energized for the day,
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.620]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.240]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.460]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.380]   with less than one gram of sugar
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.100]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.100]   It's just another reason I'm excited
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.440]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.220]   If you wanna take ownership of your health,
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.020]   it starts with AG1.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.740]   Try AG1 and get a free one-year supply

[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.100]   I just wanna thank you, Quik,

[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.580]   So speaking of that conference I went to,
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.160]   let's talk about the productivity paradox
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.860]   because I thought a lot about this in a session I led.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.120]   So this is all grounded in Parkinson's law,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.100]   which is the idea that work expands
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.820]   to fill the time allotted for its completion.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.780]   Basically, when you leave something open-ended
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.020]   and you have the whole day to do it,
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.620]   it'll take you the whole day to do it.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.520]   And if you bucket it into a single hour,
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.940]   you'll find a way to get it done in a single hour.
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.740]   The most classic example of this
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.420]   in our modern work context, I would say, is email.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.780]   If you allow it to happen,
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.360]   you will spend the entire day emailing.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.740]   I spent a lot of my life doing this.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:49.820]   Like the early years of my career,
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.580]   email would just take the entire day.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.340]   Or if you batch email into a single hour
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.180]   and you're like, "I need to get through
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.500]   "my entire inbox in this hour," you will get that done.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.440]   And so the productivity paradox
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.720]   is basically grounded in that exact idea.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.140]   Less time, you become actually more productive
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.060]   when you can work less and actually get more done.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.500]   There was a whole session at this conference,
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.380]   so it wasn't keynotes,
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.080]   it was kind of user-generated conversations,
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.020]   but about productivity, that was one.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.060]   And then there was another one where
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.120]   I led this talk about the concept of die with zero,
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.580]   focusing on net fulfillment,
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.540]   how to prioritize things in your life.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.700]   And someone said, "Oh, sometimes during the day,
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.780]   "if I need some creativity or I just need a break,
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.860]   "I'll just go mountain biking."
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.780]   And someone's like, "Well, how do you just take
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.380]   "two hours off in the middle of the day?"
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.460]   And we talked about, it turns out that
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.260]   if you take two hours out of your day,
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.840]   you can usually just get all the stuff done anyways.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.560]   - Tim Ferriss, I would say, revolutionized this idea
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.260]   with 4-Hour Workweek because he was the first person
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.500]   that just put on paper the idea of,
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.500]   "If you could only work for an hour the entire week,
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.580]   "what would you do and how would you get it done?"
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.780]   He has mastered the art of asking
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.220]   the seemingly absurd question that forces you
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.200]   to scrub away assumptions that you might have had
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.040]   about your work.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.980]   And I actually went through that exercise.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.940]   I really thought like, "Okay, if I could only work
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.420]   "for four hours a day, I used to work 12 hours a day
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.660]   "at a minimum when I was working in private equity.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.180]   "If I could only work for two hours a day,
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.820]   "if I could only work for four hours a day,
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.880]   "what would I do and how would I continue to make
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.740]   "just as much, if not more money doing it?"
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.220]   And what you realize is that you're spending time
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.260]   on a lot of things that you could either delegate,
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.460]   delete from your life, outsource, whatever,
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.660]   and really focus on the things
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.300]   that are really moving the needle.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.300]   And that's what you would do if you only had two hours.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.140]   Like, gun to your head, if you only had two hours,
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:32.980]   what would you do?
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.280]   He recently asked one that was,
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.720]   "If you had to accomplish your 10-year goals
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.360]   "in the next six months, what would you do
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.520]   "and how would you do it?"
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.900]   And that's another one where it's like,
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.120]   "Okay, all of these assumptions I've had
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.200]   "for the long-term nature of anything,
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.040]   "how do I scrub those away and just think about
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.280]   "what would have to change in my life?
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.800]   "What constraints would have to be removed?
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.240]   "What environments would have to be changed
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.500]   "for me to go unbelievable, like monk mode,
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.440]   "sprint on this given thing?"
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.080]   I just think it's worthwhile to ask yourself those questions
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.160]   to continue improving the overall flow
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.640]   of what your life looks like.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.480]   - You mentioned, Tim, I'll give a shout out
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.200]   to an episode he recently did with Sam Korkos from Levels.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.400]   He is like the master delegator, optimizer, being efficient.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.520]   I would argue that episode is like a masterclass
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.000]   in all productivity.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.360]   Is that the guy that has his day scheduled
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.160]   down to the minute, where it's like,
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.400]   you look at his schedule and it's from 6.17 to 6.22,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.240]   brush teeth?
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.020]   - I don't think he actually is that.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.960]   I think he's more focused on, "How do I achieve this task?
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.980]   "Where do I put it in the day?
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.200]   "How many hours do I spend on it?
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.980]   "How do I delegate it to someone else?
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.260]   "What's a system for that?"
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.280]   Lots of notion, lots of loom.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.120]   Maybe the most power user of loom in the world,
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.320]   based on that episode.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.880]   So we'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.560]   But on the note of moving fast,
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.160]   this monk mode, get everything done,
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.800]   I think the common assumption is,
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.620]   well, if you need to do that,
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.320]   you just need to not stop and just go.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.420]   But you have the speed paradox,
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.800]   which says the opposite might be true.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.160]   - The speed paradox actually goes hand in hand here,
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.440]   which is almost like a meta paradox.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.560]   You would assume that it doesn't.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.520]   The speed paradox is sometimes you have to slow down
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.440]   in order to speed up, move slow to move fast.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.920]   And there's this common, I think it's like Navy SEALs maybe,
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.600]   or it's a military phrase that's like,
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.040]   "Slow is smooth and smooth is fast."
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.080]   And that's the ethos of this paradox.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.920]   The basic idea here though, when you slow down,
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.520]   slowing down is what allows you to identify
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.800]   the high upside, high leverage opportunities
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.320]   that you should deploy your effort into.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.120]   Lionel Messi, slowing down and walking around the pitch
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.240]   is what allows him to have the vision
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.360]   to see those moments where he should deploy
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.200]   all of his effort.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.180]   If he was busy sprinting around
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.360]   in a million different directions,
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.440]   huffing and puffing at an 190 beat per minute heart rate,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.320]   he wouldn't be able to identify those opportunities
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.160]   'cause his plane of vision
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.360]   would be shifting all over the place.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.880]   His head would be bobbing all over the place.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.120]   It would be really hard to see it.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.280]   And so when you slow down, your vision gets really clear
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.960]   and you're able to actually identify
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.300]   where those things exist.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.140]   - So fascinating.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.960]   Speed is actually something I've been thinking a lot about,
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.080]   especially when I was running a company.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.440]   'Cause like the name of the game in venture-backed startups
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.120]   is like move fast.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.920]   And there's a guy named James Currier
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.120]   who has an investment fund called NFX.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.920]   He's one of the smartest people I know.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.440]   And his blog is pure written gold, in my opinion,
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.680]   if you're running a company.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.000]   And he gave this talk once,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.180]   and I'm so disappointed it wasn't recorded,
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.560]   but about speed.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.400]   And there were a few things that he pointed out.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.800]   A lot of it is fear.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.160]   The reason that you sometimes can't move as fast as you want
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.600]   is that you're just not sure how it will work.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.200]   And then once you get over that fear, things get unlocked.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.280]   And I think Roger Bannister
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.040]   is the example everyone always gives,
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.400]   which is no one ever ran a four-minute mile.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.280]   1954, Roger Bannister runs a four-minute mile.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.480]   And I think within three months,
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.720]   eight more people could do it.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.240]   It's like they didn't think it was possible.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.520]   It just hadn't even crossed their mind.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.360]   Was it fear?
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.240]   Was it something else?
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.320]   They just didn't believe it was possible.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.160]   One of his tips was simplify everything.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.360]   And so in this slowing down phase before moving fast,
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.820]   and some of these examples are maybe business only,
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.000]   but he's like simplify every contract you use with a vendor.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.360]   Don't write custom things.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.400]   Say this is what we're using, budgeting.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.460]   Create a simple budgeting process.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.160]   But for health, an example I'll use,
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.680]   which I think slowing down to speed up is,
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.600]   if you wanna really focus on health, slow down,
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.440]   think how do I just make my meals very simple?
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.680]   How do I make it incredibly easy for me to not be unhealthy?
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.000]   And that takes some foresight,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.280]   what you stock in your pantry,
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.040]   how you do your shopping, how you do your meal prep.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.000]   But then it actually makes it really easy
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.720]   to quickly be on track with food goals.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.800]   So there was just so much in that talk.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.320]   If I could turn that into a podcast,
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.540]   I'm going through in my mind
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.200]   all the things that he talked about.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.280]   The best example he gave,
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.200]   which was so fascinating about mindset,
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.160]   'cause he said mind is literally everything
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   when it comes to moving fast.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.920]   So if you need to slow down to recalibrate your mind,
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.080]   but he was working at a software company
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.560]   that made video games.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.920]   And he asked, he had a team of 40,
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.160]   and they said it takes two years to make a video game.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.160]   That was the operating assumption.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.720]   And he said, we're gonna ship a video game in 21 days.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.700]   And 38 of the 40 people were like, no.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.160]   And two of them were like, we could try.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.960]   And he was like, great, this game looks great.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.300]   I don't know, I think it was like a Facebook,
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.160]   back in the day with Facebook games.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.500]   They just copied someone else's game.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.840]   But these two engineers,
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.240]   and slowly over the 21 days, people came on.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.360]   They actually did it.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.880]   And at the end, they were like,
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.280]   we did this thing that everyone on the team
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.120]   thought would take two years, we did it in 21 days.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.360]   Now the funny part of the story
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.840]   is I believe they got a cease and desist
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.340]   like immediately after from the company they copied.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.900]   But it didn't matter, because as soon as he finished,
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.400]   they said, great, we'll shut that game down.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.340]   Now my entire team knows we can build a game in 21 days.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.120]   We can go build our own original thing.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.620]   We don't have to worry about that.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.800]   Those 38 people thought it was impossible.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:50.480]   And so sometimes you just have to train yourself
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.840]   or test yourself or push past that point
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.400]   at which you don't believe it's possible.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.480]   And that takes some slowing down and some forethought.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.760]   - That's a great story.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.280]   - I have a lot of thoughts on speed
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.800]   and how valuable it can be,
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.720]   and how just running straight into it
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.960]   might not be the best answer.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.720]   - Yeah, and it's a broader metaphor for life.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   There's the idea of work like a lion,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.840]   like sprint, rest, and repeat.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.760]   And the rest is just as important as the sprint.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.600]   And that's a piece that most people lose sight of
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.960]   is you have to have the rest
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.440]   in order for the sprint to be as efficient as possible.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.400]   If you don't have the rest,
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.080]   then your sprint is gonna be a jog.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.080]   And most people in most work cultures default to a jog,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   where you're just sort of grazing throughout the day.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.560]   Naval has talked about this, and it's really true.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.040]   And so figuring out a way to align your overall life,
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.640]   professionally, personally, health, physically,
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.120]   all of these different areas
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.360]   into much more of a sprint and then rest system
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.520]   is much more efficient for actually driving progress.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.800]   - And to go back, we started with the advice paradox.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.840]   And yes, much advice might not be helpful,
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.440]   but for a lot of scenarios in things you wanna sprint on,
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.080]   there are probably some people whose advice is very relevant.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.640]   And so whether you're building something at a company
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.440]   or you're trying to dial in your health,
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.360]   not taking the time during that slowdown phase
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.200]   to seek out, okay,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.120]   is there someone who's done a very similar thing?
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.480]   Is there a playbook for it?
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.800]   Is there an answer out there
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.960]   so I don't have to solve every problem myself
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.600]   is something that I like to do
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.280]   in that kind of slowdown before sprint mode.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.600]   And so it could be as simple as,
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.340]   okay, if I just sprint into fitness,
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.540]   I don't even know what I would do right now.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:29.680]   But if I paused and said,
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.080]   okay, is there someone who could design a workout regimen
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.680]   or someone who just has already designed one
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.840]   and published it on the internet?
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.320]   Or a friend that could just tell me something to do
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.800]   so that I didn't spend all this time swirling around what?
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.680]   If you solve the what in advance
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.320]   during your wind down kind of slowdown time,
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.600]   you can execute much, much faster.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.800]   The flip side to it,
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.400]   which you need to be aware of,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.680]   is that sometimes slowing down
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.600]   and doing all of that kind of research and evaluation
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.320]   is like procrastination in disguise.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.760]   Like with fitness, you would say,
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.200]   okay, well, let me slow down
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.320]   and figure out the right fitness and health regimen.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.280]   And I'm gonna construct the best plan.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.000]   And the reality is kind of like the midwit meme
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.200]   where like in the middle, they're like,
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.360]   I'm gonna develop a two-tiered functional
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.840]   strength training program that involves hypertrophy
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.560]   and all these middling things.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.760]   And then on the two ends of the midwit meme,
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.840]   it's like, move your body for 30 minutes a day.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.800]   And you just do that.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.480]   And so sometimes you just need to watch out
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.720]   for the fact that you're not slowing down
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.600]   as a means to procrastinate and like,
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.800]   oh, I need the perfect system.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.320]   Well, you just need to start moving
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.800]   and you can figure it out as you go.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.760]   And so balancing those, which again,
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.920]   are in like a little bit of tension is an important thing.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.520]   - In this talk that we had about Die With Zero
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.200]   and focusing on fulfillment, it was interesting.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.800]   There were kind of two camps.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.480]   Somehow the discussion came up of like taking a year off
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.200]   and traveling with your family.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.640]   And two people had done this successfully.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.560]   One of them went to Europe with their kids
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.160]   and the other one, I can't remember,
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.840]   took a sabbatical and did something.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.360]   And then the other half of the room was like,
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.240]   I don't know how to do that.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.720]   Like that seems impossible, I've tried.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.640]   And what was interesting was we ended up having
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.760]   this long conversation about why people don't set
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   personal goals and deadlines and structure
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.400]   their personal ambitions like they would professional.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.720]   We've all, almost everyone listening, you and I,
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.080]   we've all been in a workplace where we're like, wow,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.480]   here's a thing that needs to be delivered by a date.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.400]   What are we gonna do?
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.720]   Well, we're gonna make sure this gets done in the first week
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.200]   and then we're gonna delegate this thing
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.240]   and this person has four days to do it.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.000]   And then we sit down with our family and we're like,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.840]   well, we wanna go on a trip to Europe.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.040]   It's like, cool, we'll talk about that next week.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.760]   Like you just don't set up these kind of milestones
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   and structure and I won't go as far as to call them OKRs,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.040]   but we just don't have a lot of process
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.120]   around our personal goals.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.960]   And so I think it was an episode I did with Ben Nempton,
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.200]   who has written this book called "The Bucket List Journal",
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.400]   had this crazy bucket list story, really fascinating guy.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.440]   And he was like, people just need to set goals.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.320]   Like what's the next step I'm gonna take
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.180]   towards this personal goal?
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:02.080]   And so I think when it comes to procrastination,
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.440]   especially with health and personal stuff,
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.680]   you can slow down, I'm all for slowing down,
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.040]   but to help yourself not get caught in that procrastination
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.120]   and never make progress, set a goal, set a deadline,
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.320]   which we never do personally.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.480]   - Yeah, my book is going to have that incorporated
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.880]   as like in each of these domains.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.460]   And my book is gonna be called "The Five Types of Wealth".
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.760]   It's going to track your life across
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.400]   what I view as the five types of wealth.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.800]   And within each section, it helps you actually identify
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.900]   what are your goals and what are your anti-goals
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.300]   around those, each type of wealth,
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.480]   so that you can go and do that.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.700]   You can actually create a plan
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.740]   and actually make progress on these things.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.040]   - Can I try to guess the five?
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.180]   - No, we don't want to do it now.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.040]   I don't want to reveal all this before the book.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.100]   - When it comes to making progress in life,
[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.660]   we'll not talk about what types of wealth
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.500]   we want to accumulate in our life,
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.000]   but there is a lot of distraction.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.920]   And so I think you had two things
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.160]   that actually came up a little bit
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.320]   in that interview Tim did with Sam
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.060]   about things that can just get in the way of everything.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.740]   So let's talk about social media and news.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.260]   - Both near and dear to my heart for different reasons.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:03.940]   So the social media paradox,
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.220]   or you could call it the connectedness paradox,
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:11.220]   is this idea that we have more connectedness
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.900]   than ever before, and yet we feel less connected
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.260]   to those around us simultaneously.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.780]   There was a viral video several years ago of "Look Up".
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.980]   It's like people just looking down at their phones all day
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.220]   and looking down at screens,
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.660]   and they forget to look up at the people
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.580]   that are sitting right in front of them.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.220]   And it's a really sad thing.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.180]   If you go walk around in New York City,
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.300]   you're weird if you look at someone and smile
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.140]   and say hello.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.580]   And if you think 20 years ago, that was what you did.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.580]   You walked around, you tipped your hat at people.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.220]   That was the way that people lived,
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.220]   and you actually interacted with people face-to-face.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.780]   Today, a young person that's trying to date
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.100]   doesn't know how to go up to someone
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.940]   and talk to them in a bar, in a restaurant,
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.780]   or wherever they are.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.640]   They know how to swipe on their phone
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.800]   in order to meet people.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.100]   And it's a really, really powerful trend.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.340]   And what I think is happening now
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.660]   is the pendulum swings.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.420]   And so you have this environment
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.700]   where everything is through your phones
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.660]   and through your interactions
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.740]   and digital, social media, et cetera.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.420]   And you have this swing that comes back towards,
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.060]   in real life, real human connection.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.100]   And it's interesting to watch,
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.300]   and it's interesting to observe,
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.100]   especially with the rise of AI.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.740]   - And so is the lesson,
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.580]   think about it differently or do it less?
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.220]   - The lesson is put your damn phone down more often.
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.820]   And this is coming from someone who,
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.500]   for work, quote unquote,
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.260]   has to spend a lot of time on social media,
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.300]   but I really need to make a concerted effort
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.440]   on a daily basis to put my phone down
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.020]   and to be present, in particular,
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:33.340]   with my wife and with my son.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.800]   Because it's very easy when you are so connected there
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.620]   and when the dopamine drip is so clear
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.100]   that comes from those things
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.180]   to just keep your phone on you
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.540]   and keep checking, keep pulling it out,
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.700]   keep looking at the thing.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.240]   And that's what they're designed for.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.320]   Like these social media platforms
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.980]   and social media is a drug.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.580]   And it's a really effective drug
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.960]   because it continuously feeds you
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.520]   with these tiny little drips of dopamine
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.980]   that make you want to keep coming back.
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.660]   And we need to find a way to disconnect from that
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.980]   in order to connect with the people around us.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.300]   - Have you ever experimented
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.980]   with just deleting the apps from your phone
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.860]   and only doing it on the computer or?
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.700]   - I've tried.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.060]   It never has made that much of a difference for me.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.900]   Honestly, like because a lot of my work is through my phone,
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.860]   I like being able to have access to it.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.700]   I've tried all the different apps
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.100]   that kind of restrict your time.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.600]   The iPhone now has like a pretty good interface
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.900]   for restricting the amount of time
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.780]   you spend on an app during a day.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.180]   It requires the discipline to actually stick to it
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.980]   when you've hit the total by, you know,
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:27.780]   earlier in the day to actually stick to it.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.660]   But I've been able to create a system that works for me,
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.220]   which is basically a phone gets put down
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.300]   at a certain time in the evening and that's it.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.140]   You know, it's down.
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.960]   - And what about news?
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.020]   - So the news paradox is the idea
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.060]   that the more news you consume,
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.060]   the less well-informed you are.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.860]   This tends to be a somewhat controversial topic
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.700]   when you talk about it or share it.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.980]   Typically, like you get a lot of people
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.220]   that actually work in media just saying you're an idiot
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.340]   or that's incorrect.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.140]   This goes back to the noise bottleneck
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.660]   that I talked about to Leb's idea at the beginning
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.700]   that as you consume more and more news,
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.780]   you're actually getting a higher ratio of noise to signal.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.620]   And so your overall understanding of the issue
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.820]   or of the world actually becomes worse
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.540]   despite the fact that you're consuming more,
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.900]   which you wouldn't expect.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:09.220]   I have personally found
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.500]   that my life has improved dramatically
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.300]   since I've dramatically reduced the amount of news I consume
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.260]   and I'm talking like I cold turkey
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:20.620]   probably reduced my news consumption by like 95%,
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.180]   maybe like two years ago.
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.260]   And I feel happier.
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.460]   I like have heavily curated my news sources
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.300]   to where I read one or two things.
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.060]   And I just know that I understand
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.020]   at least like a foundational level about the world.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.780]   If I wanna go deeper on an issue, I can do that.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.500]   I know where to do it and how to do it.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.520]   But I don't feel like I'm hit by the barrage
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.740]   of like breaking news, urgent, blah, blah, blah,
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.940]   whatever all the things are on a daily basis.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.100]   And I actively avoid following
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.260]   and consuming from those accounts on Twitter
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.140]   or on any of the relevant platforms.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.140]   - So how do you use that 5% that's left?
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:51.980]   - How do I use it?
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.460]   - Yeah, you say, well, now I've bound my news consumption
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:55.740]   to a small amount.
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:58.700]   Is it reading people who do a good job summarizing?
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.220]   Is it specific sources?
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.980]   - I think Axios does a great job
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.840]   as one of the platforms that is really good,
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.660]   but it's basically like one hit per day
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.260]   of like you're getting the basics
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.800]   of the things that are happening in the world
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.620]   and in any different arena you're interested in.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:13.460]   And then from there, if you wanna go deeper on something,
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.740]   like if you think as the heuristic that I've seen
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:16.580]   that I think is useful,
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.620]   like is something going to be relevant a month from now?
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:21.260]   And if so, you should probably try to know more about it.
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.740]   Most of the news that we see on a daily basis
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.360]   is not relevant more than like an hour later.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.300]   And everything is labeled as breaking news.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.860]   Nothing is breaking news if everything is breaking news.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.560]   And they use it to get clicks.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.060]   I totally understand how media works.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.980]   So I totally get it and I get the incentives.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.380]   I get why they operate the way they do.
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:41.340]   I just don't wanna be hit by it and polluted by it
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.380]   in the way that I think.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.940]   If I was going to like get crazy mentally connected
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.780]   to every single news story that came my way
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.300]   during the day, I would have no time to think
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.040]   about things that I actually care about.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.880]   And so I just try to actively avoid it.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.660]   News often also follows the productivity paradox.
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.500]   And if you turned on CNN,
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.340]   and not to knock any particular news channel,
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:05.560]   but you could watch a specific piece of content
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.820]   for three hours and you're not gonna get
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.180]   three hours of knowledge.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.380]   Sometimes I find myself thinking,
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.980]   ooh, I'm gonna just consume this thing
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.180]   that might take a long time and then just pausing.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.860]   I think one of the ones for me is
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.540]   anytime Apple does a keynote.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.540]   And yes, there's some excitement about it,
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.700]   but I find that I'm like, ooh, I wanna watch the keynote.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.100]   And I know it's gonna be an hour.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.820]   I also know I could read the summary of the keynote
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.620]   at the end in 10 minutes or five minutes
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.140]   and I catch myself and I feel like anytime
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:34.940]   you put the news on TV or you could just fall
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.540]   into this trap of somehow they can make
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:41.140]   a five minute piece expand and fill two hours
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.140]   and it can be mind numbing.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.060]   I mean, this is the whole thing with CNBC.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.620]   It's like financial news, right?
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:50.100]   Where no one is making a return by picking stocks.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.440]   Most hedge funds aren't making alpha
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.120]   and their entire job is to do that.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.460]   So like you as a person sitting at home
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.980]   should probably not be spending your time picking stocks
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.020]   if that's not like your exclusive job
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.320]   and you're one of the best in the world at it.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.160]   You probably shouldn't.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.580]   It's not a great allocation of resources and time.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.180]   And yet CNBC the entire day, 24 hours a day
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.460]   has people jumping on, trotting up there
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.580]   and talking about stocks that they're interested in
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.620]   and stock picks.
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:16.140]   There's this story that I've heard
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.260]   of someone getting asked this,
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.060]   like how can you possibly do this?
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.460]   Like Kramer's on for all these hours.
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.000]   He has all these terrible stock picks
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.460]   and you need to reframe it as it's entertainment.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.500]   Like we have 24 hours of programming that we need to fill
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.020]   and so we need entertaining people to be up there.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.380]   And like a lot of news has become entertainment.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.700]   It's no longer information.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.320]   It's like they're trying to hook you.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.500]   They're trying to keep you there and keep you entertained.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.700]   And what's entertaining, but like blaring,
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.620]   breaking news in all red, bold fonts,
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.860]   sitting across the page.
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:47.020]   It's not entertaining for them to talk about
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:49.500]   the new speed bumps that were put in your city
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.360]   or Girl Scout cookie campaign that's going on.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.620]   What's entertaining for them
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.380]   and what keeps people there is fear.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.380]   It's like these many people got killed,
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.220]   this terrorist attack happened, this thing,
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.900]   like that's what's keeping people there.
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.260]   And it makes you think that the entire world
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.540]   is that's what's going on, right?
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.500]   There was this chart that was like
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.700]   comparing actual causes of death
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.740]   to causes of death talked about in the media side by side.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.740]   And you look at it and like the actual causes of death
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:16.380]   was like heart disease, cancer, you know,
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.380]   like the actual things.
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.520]   And then when you look at the media one,
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.700]   it's like terrorism, crime, murders,
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.140]   like that was what it was.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.020]   It was like inverse, like it was literally like,
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.300]   it was like a parody almost, but it was reality.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.740]   And it's because what do they report on?
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.140]   It's the things that they think will get people to click
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.540]   and that will stick there and that's fear.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.980]   And if you wanna live that way, consume more of that.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.420]   - Yeah, I don't imagine the evening news
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.340]   focused on heart disease would be that exciting
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.420]   for the average person.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:43.860]   - There was this old movie, like way back in the day,
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:45.660]   I think it might've been a Michael Moore movie.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.220]   I feel like I saw it when I was 13 or 14.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.020]   I think it was called "Bowling for Columbine"
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:51.980]   that politics aside on all of this stuff,
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.660]   there was just an interesting juxtaposition
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.100]   that I remember he did in it
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.940]   of like showing the news in Canada
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:58.780]   and then showing the news in the US.
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.780]   And the Canadian one, it was looking at like speed bumps
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.260]   or something that got put like painted differently in town.
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.220]   And then it showed the US one,
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.380]   which was all shootings and crime and all this stuff.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.420]   So it was interesting.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:09.260]   - I used to watch PBS News Hour
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.780]   because it was just a much more practical source of news.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.620]   And then I was like,
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.180]   "Oh, then they put all the news in a podcast for an hour."
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.980]   I don't know where it dropped off in my routine,
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.540]   but it wasn't replaced by other news.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:20.820]   So I guess maybe that's a good thing,
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:23.500]   but it didn't go into the fear mongering.
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.940]   - The other thing is there's a lot of opinion
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.460]   and not a lot of fact in news these days
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:29.780]   because it's entertainment,
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.180]   because that's what drives clicks
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.220]   and that's what drives the business model.
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.940]   And that's challenging because like a lot of these,
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.980]   it seems like a lot of these news stories,
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.380]   they're changing minute to minute.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.460]   Like if you go look at the headline on one of their webpages
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.980]   when something happens, it's one thing,
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.780]   you go back an hour later and the headline
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.740]   and the entire spin on it has changed
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:50.380]   because some new information surfaced, whatever it was.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.700]   And so it's actually hard to know at any point in time,
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.300]   like, okay, what am I getting?
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:57.140]   Like, is this real or is this biased in some way?
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.340]   Has this been hit by like a bunch of filters
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.900]   and like hierarchies, whatever it is,
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.020]   it's hard to figure out like where can you actually count
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.140]   on the news source.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.700]   - So maybe we'll close out and put this all in perspective
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.660]   with the death paradox.
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.500]   - Oh.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:11.860]   - Just to take like a hard turn.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:12.700]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.940]   We're gonna end on a really bright,
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.860]   shiny, sunny rainbows note.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.260]   - I think it kind of is.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.300]   - It is, I agree.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:23.300]   So memento mori is this idea of knowing your mortality.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:27.180]   It originates from, I think the Roman empire
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.860]   where the returning conquering hero
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.660]   after a military campaign would be paraded
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.860]   through the cities with adoring fans cheering for them
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:37.540]   in this like golden chariot.
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:41.300]   And they would place a person behind the conquering hero,
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.580]   whispering in their ear, memento mori,
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.580]   which means like know your mortality,
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.540]   remember that you are mortal.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.900]   And the whole idea is that you have to know your death
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.500]   in order to live your life.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:55.660]   The idea is like, if you aren't aware of your own mortality,
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:58.500]   you expose yourself to a terrible thing
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.100]   and to terrible life.
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.500]   So I think about this a lot.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.020]   There's these calendars that have become
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.420]   this like very viral trend.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.420]   It's 52 rows across, like squares across,
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.740]   and there's 80 squares down.
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:10.420]   And the whole idea is that you shade one in
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.580]   every single week and you can actually see your own life
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:16.900]   going into black as you shade them in across your life.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:19.260]   And for some people, that's really morbid.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.260]   And for other people, it's really empowering
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:23.460]   to know that like every week matters.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.220]   I mean, you can physically see the weeks going by
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.300]   in your life and that the weeks you're never going
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:31.300]   to get back, how precious time is with people.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.820]   So it's something that I think about personally often,
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.780]   probably much more often now that I'm a father
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.340]   than before that, but something that I think everyone
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.340]   should reconcile a bit more in their life.
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.060]   - When you were talking about news, it's like,
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.380]   oh, do I want to cut out an hour here, here?
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.940]   I think when you start to really put into perspective
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:49.020]   how much time you have on this earth,
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.700]   is it 40,000 weeks or 4,000?
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.540]   - 4,000 weeks.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:53.380]   - I have a 40,000.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.700]   - There's a great book, by the way.
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:56.780]   I don't know, Oliver Berkman wrote "4,000 Weeks."
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:57.620]   - "4,000 Weeks."
[00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.020]   - Which is an incredible book on all of this stuff.
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.620]   - Yeah, and it just makes me think, you know,
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.820]   "Die With Zero" was a, they're all in the light of,
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.980]   we have this limited time, focus on how we use it,
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.660]   prioritize things that matter, don't let things
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.740]   that you don't care about fill your days.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.940]   I feel like with that perspective, you could go back
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.700]   and think about a lot of these paradoxes
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.260]   and figure out the best way to apply them
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.780]   so that you're living a life that's truest
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.520]   to what you want, which unfortunately seems to be,
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.620]   not seems to be, is the most common regret
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.660]   most people have at the end of their life,
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.540]   is not living life true to what they wanted.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.700]   - Yeah, not all time is created equal.
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:36.820]   I mean, you're in your 30s, I'm 32.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:40.020]   This 10-year period relative to the 10-year period
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.260]   when I'm 80 is very, very different
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.580]   in terms of what I can do with my son,
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.140]   in terms of what I can do with my parents
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.020]   while they're still around, all of these different things.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.420]   And so if you just wait, if you delay all satisfaction,
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:55.000]   if you continue to say, play the deferred happiness game
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.500]   of when I get to this much money
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.360]   or when I get this promotion or when I get whatever it is,
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.420]   then I'll be happy, what you're gonna find
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.560]   is that you're gonna keep saying that until you die.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.320]   And until your kids are gone and they've moved off,
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.480]   they don't wanna hang out with you.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.600]   And until your parents are gone and you're not able
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.080]   to hang out with them or spend time with them anymore.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.240]   And that's a terrible thing.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.040]   And it's really, really sad when that happens to people.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.820]   - So I didn't mean to bring us to this place
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.200]   of thinking about death before the end,
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.640]   after we talk about the news, talking about death,
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.160]   but I think it's really valuable
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.760]   to put everything in perspective.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.600]   - I agree.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.720]   - Obviously, we'll put a link to the multiple paradoxes.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.720]   I don't know how many there are in total,
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.080]   'cause you wrote one with 10, 15, 120, there are a lot,
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.640]   but I'll link to a few of them in the show notes.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.240]   We didn't get to all of them,
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.420]   but I think we hit on the ones
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.640]   that I was most excited to talk about.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.480]   - Yeah, this was awesome.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.680]   Really, really fun discussion.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.080]   - Thanks for being here in person.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.920]   - Love doing it.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.880]   - Next time we'll have to do it in the sauna.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.720]   It'll be a different conversation.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.880]   - We'll do sauna cold plunge
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.920]   and we'll see who can last longer in the cold plunge.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.760]   - We'll see.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.580]   I need some practice.
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.800]   - That was amazing.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.460]   I love recording with Sahil.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.920]   He's such a wealth of knowledge
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.720]   and an all around great human.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.160]   I highly recommend his newsletter.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.560]   If you're not already subscribed,
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.680]   definitely check it out.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.160]   It's linked in the show notes.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.680]   And speaking of newsletters,
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.840]   the All The Hacks newsletter
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.360]   is getting an upgrade this year,
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.220]   and I'm gonna start sending out a summary
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.080]   of the best things I've found every week or two,
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.040]   whether that's deals, products, or interesting articles.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.520]   So if you're not subscribed,
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.160]   head on over to allthehacks.com/email to sign up.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.720]   Okay, that's it for this week.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.000]   I will see you next week.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.600]   I wanna tell you about another podcast I love
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.920]   that goes deep on all things money.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.580]   That means everything from money hacks
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.740]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.920]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast,
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.800]   and it's much more about building generational wealth
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.040]   and spending your money on the things you value
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.940]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.880]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.100]   who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.760]   can build wealth, and his passion and excitement
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.240]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.080]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.120]   but recently I listened to an episode
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.600]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind,
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.480]   and it was so crazy to learn things
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.460]   like 35% of millennials are not participating
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:13.360]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:17.040]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.720]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.400]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.280]   to help you get better with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.640]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.320]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
