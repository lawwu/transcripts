[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   [laughter]
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.640]   This is a great joy for me to be here because I have been so profoundly blessed by the impact
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:24.400]   that over the last couple of years the Lord has brought on our STEM environment here in
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400]   the academic world.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.360]   And I understand because of our complete submission to the Word of God that we are in a unique
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.280]   place to bring together an understanding of the universe from the very mouth of the Creator.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.920]   And the dynamics of that are just beyond what the world could ever even imagine.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.020]   I think I got a little dose of that in the video today and some of the things you saw
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.800]   with regard to the development of the zygote and the embryo and the wondrous work of God.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.120]   So I'm not a scientist and I don't intend to be, but I have studied on the fringes of
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.640]   science as part of understanding Scripture.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.360]   I did a series on Genesis.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.640]   I went through the first eleven chapters of Genesis and this was my deepest foray into
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.280]   science trying to tackle the issue of creation.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.040]   And it came out in a book, The Battle for the Beginning.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.680]   Some of you may have heard of it or seen it around if you want, they're available.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:48.980]   You can read through that approach to Genesis that comes from solely a biblical understanding.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.560]   And I keep hearing from, I think it was Andy Stanley recently who said when science and
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.820]   the Bible collide, science is always right.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.820]   Which is a strange thing for a pastor to say and like abandoning your field.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.220]   But that's what he said and we have found just the opposite to be true.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.820]   But I'm not here to talk about that.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.400]   I'm here to just say thank you for coming to the Master's University, I hope you had
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   a good time.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.060]   I hope the folks have provided what you need to build some relationships, make some new
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.300]   friendships and feel like you have partners in the battle that you fight out there in
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.820]   the midst of the university environment.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.620]   So we want to be your encouragers and I was just telling Ty Denne, we need to do this
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.080]   as often as we can to continually encourage you.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.440]   We're prepared to just keep doing it.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.600]   But I do want to talk to you a little bit about the positive side of your ministry.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.440]   We can't just play defense.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.060]   We may be in a tough environment, but you can't just hunker down and play defense because
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.540]   that's not what the commission is, right?
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.580]   Wherever you are, you've got to go on the offense.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.380]   You've got to represent the King and the kingdom.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.980]   And I understand you have to do it with some wisdom and judiciousness and some discernment.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.180]   And I'm sure the Spirit of God will give you that.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.000]   But what I think is most important for us, if we are going to do what the Lord has commissioned
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.840]   us to do, even in a very difficult environment, no matter how challenging and hostile that
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.200]   environment is, we have to be crystal clear about what the message is.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.280]   There are so many vagaries within the framework of "evangelical Christianity."
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:57.300]   And over the last couple of years, we've had this Christian deconstruction movement, #Exvangelicals,
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.720]   which means there are some people coming into evangelicalism, some people going out of evangelicalism,
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.640]   and everybody at every point seems to have a different definition of what it is.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.760]   If you listen to Christian radio or watch Christian television or go to your Christian
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.020]   bookstore, there seems to be no end to the optional ways that you could understand what's
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.440]   essential in Christianity.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.480]   But you need more than that.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.240]   You don't need to be lost on that issue.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.840]   You don't need to be unclear on that.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.280]   You need to be crystal clear on the heart and soul of the gospel.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.260]   That's what's on my heart to share with you today.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.900]   And it comes out of a text in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, "I am hopelessly bound to the Word
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.320]   of God and to the texts of the Word of God."
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:05:01.120]   And this one is really a very, very clear summation of the gospel and of our calling.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.080]   It's 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.320]   And I think maybe a good place to start is in verse 17.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.080]   I'll read it to you, and then we'll talk about it.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:25.240]   Starting from verse 17 to 21, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.860]   The old things passed away; behold, new things have come.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:39.700]   Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:50.480]   ministry of reconciliation, namely, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.260]   not counting their trespasses against them.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.600]   And he has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:09.460]   Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ as though God were making an appeal through us.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.760]   We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:23.440]   He made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.800]   of God in him."
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.040]   The word that appears most frequently in those verses is a form of the word reconcile.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.280]   That's really the heart of this.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.700]   The commission that we have been given by God is here called the word of reconciliation
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:54.620]   or the message of reconciliation, namely, that God is reconciling sinners to himself
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.560]   through Christ.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.600]   This is the word of reconciliation, and this is the ministry of reconciliation.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:10.040]   So I think just to define our great commission in terms other than the familiar great commission,
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.200]   say of Matthew 28, is to understand that we have been given the ministry of reconciliation.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:26.380]   And it comes down to the fact that we proclaim the message that God desires to be reconciled
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.200]   to sinners.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:36.160]   That is the heart of the Christian calling, the ministry of reconciliation and the word
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.400]   of reconciliation or the message or the teaching of reconciliation.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.080]   Now we all understand alienation, and I think we're all familiar with the fact that the
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.400]   Bible is crystal clear that we come into this world alienated from the life of God.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.240]   Those are the very words of the Apostle Paul in the book of Ephesians.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.040]   Everybody is alienated from God, alienated from the life of God.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.820]   We are enemies of God, and God is our enemy.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:13.200]   Even while we were enemies, Romans tells us, God sought to reconcile us.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.280]   So we have to start with the realization that the whole human race is at enmity with God,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:28.720]   hostile toward God, and God is hostile toward them to the degree that He has prepared not
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:37.760]   just temporal judgments, and there are many of those on sin, but everlasting judgment
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.600]   on sinners.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.400]   So reconciliation is the issue.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.280]   I have had conversations a number of times through the years on airplanes with people
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:54.880]   who ask me what I do, and one of the common ways I answer that question is to say, I tell
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.640]   sinners they can be reconciled to God.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.440]   Are you interested?
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.080]   It's amazing the result of that question.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.960]   I remember flying across the country.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.360]   There was a long-haired rock musician next to me, and when I asked that question, he
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.520]   got up and left, and it was a five-hour flight, and I never saw him again.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.080]   So there is that reality.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.360]   No, I'm not interested.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.680]   I'm not interested.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.140]   But this is substantially the foundation of the gospel.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:35.200]   You as a sinner can be reconciled to God.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.600]   And most people have the sense that God is good and holy.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:48.960]   I mean, that's kind of what's in the groundwater of our civilization, and that they are not.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:55.000]   And so they understand, even if it's a rather primitive understanding, the reality of reconciliation.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.640]   They also live with disappointment, lack of fulfillment, guilt, fear, anxiety, all those
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.140]   things that are really not bound up only in the issues of life, but in the existential
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.800]   reality that you don't know what's coming after this, but you could be, frankly, in
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.240]   a lot of trouble.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.800]   So the message of reconciliation is the good news.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.480]   And to understand that is to be able to offer the sinner something positive, the most positive
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.080]   message that the sinner could ever hear.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.040]   So I want to talk a little bit about this idea of reconciliation.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:45.360]   And in the same passage that I just read, you saw that the Apostle Paul designates all
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.960]   of us as ambassadors.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.720]   That's in verse 20, ambassadors.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:02.480]   That means that we literally have been signed as representatives of a foreign kingdom to
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.620]   be in an alien environment with a message of reconciliation.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.540]   That's why we're here.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.000]   I often say that.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.600]   The only reason the Lord didn't take us to heaven when we were saved is because He wanted
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.900]   to use us to reconcile sinners.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:26.560]   If we were saved for fellowship, we ought to go to heaven where fellowship is perfect,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.280]   because down here it's sometimes difficult.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.940]   If we were saved for righteousness, we ought to go to heaven where righteousness really
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.920]   exists because down here it's pretty difficult.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:45.360]   The only reason to leave us here and suffer the weaknesses of those kind of elements is
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:51.840]   because we are the instruments that God uses as ambassadors in an alien environment to
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:57.260]   tell people that they can be reconciled to God.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.200]   And that's the message.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.220]   Now what does that look like?
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.280]   So I want to break this passage down for just a few minutes.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.560]   Just some simple aspects of it.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.640]   And here's the starting point.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.720]   And I think this is a very important starting point.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.760]   Reconciliation is by the will of God.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.540]   Reconciliation is by the will of God.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:29.940]   If you go back to verse 18, all these things are from God.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.440]   What things?
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:38.200]   The things mentioned in verse 17, all the new things that come in regeneration, all
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.960]   the new things that come when you're a new creature, all the new things that come through
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:49.100]   salvation, they all are from God.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:55.120]   And I think it has to be established in our minds firmly that when we go to preaching
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.440]   and proclaiming and giving testimony to the ministry of reconciliation, the good news
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.220]   of reconciliation, God is on our side.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.920]   God is by nature a reconciler.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:18.200]   Repeatedly, particularly in the pastoral epistles of 1st and 2nd Timothy, we read God our Savior,
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.120]   God our Savior, God our Savior, God our Savior.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:28.760]   Now this sets God apart from every other religious and ethnic system in the world.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.040]   No other religion has a God who is by nature a Savior.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.880]   They are gods to be feared.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.200]   For example, in Islam, there is no salvation.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.160]   There is no path of reconciliation.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.120]   There's only alienation and a wistful hope that somehow it might turn out better than
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.520]   you think.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.240]   But our God is by nature a saving God.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:59.420]   People ask the question, "Why did God destroy so many people in the Old Testament?
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.200]   Why did God want the Canaanites killed?
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.120]   Why did God drown the whole world?"
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:11.540]   Seems as though God is by nature wrathful, vengeful, angry, hostile, judgmental.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:19.460]   But the fact of the matter is the big question is not why did God judge, but why didn't God
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.700]   judge everybody instantaneously?
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:33.660]   That's why the Apostle Paul says that God is the Savior of all men, especially, little
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:39.520]   Greek adverb, melista, especially those who believe.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.700]   God is not just the Savior of those who believe.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:47.840]   He's the Savior of those who believe in an eternal sense, but His saving desire is on
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.040]   display even to the rest of humanity all the time.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.540]   How is that so?
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.920]   Well, because the Bible says the wages of sin is what?
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   Death.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.400]   You go to Genesis, the day you die.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.560]   And how long did Adam live?
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.440]   900 plus years.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.240]   What does that say?
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.160]   God didn't kill Adam when he took a bite.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   The very fact that sinners live, survive, enjoy what theologians call, I guess, common
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.240]   grace.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:31.740]   They can enjoy love and beauty and adventure and everything that life offers them is because
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:38.740]   God puts on display His nature as a Savior by not giving sinners what they deserve when
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.640]   they deserve it.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.540]   In that sense, He's the Savior of all men.
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:53.940]   Sinners need to be reminded not that God is this terrifying judge with no compassion,
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:04.020]   but rather on the other hand, He is slow to anger, slow to anger, and full of mercy and
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.860]   full of forbearance.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:14.060]   And sinners take massive advantage of that without ever recognizing it.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:19.020]   The forbearance of God is to lead to repentance.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.660]   So the good news is this, you don't have to convince God to save sinners.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.300]   You just have to convince sinners to come to Him.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:38.520]   You know, if you're in Roman Catholic environment, there is a dominating idea there that does
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.740]   a terrible injustice to God, and it's this.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:53.820]   God Himself is very hard, kind of tough, busy, occupied with things that God has on His plate,
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.340]   you might say.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.060]   So God probably isn't going to be disturbed by you.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.960]   He's not going to want to have to deal with your issues.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.420]   So you don't want to go directly to God, and He's pretty harsh anyway.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.380]   You might want to go to Christ, but the problem is Christ might be a little too occupied for
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.500]   you as well, and He might lack a measure of compassion.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:26.740]   So if you really want to get to God, you go to Mary.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:35.060]   That's what's behind the whole system of Mary in the Catholic religion, that Mary plays
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:43.300]   on the sympathies of Jesus to make Him more compassionate and more long-suffering and
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.780]   more willing to forgive.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:56.220]   I mean, it's a line as simple as this, "Jesus can't refuse His mother," which funnels everybody
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:05.020]   through Mary, who, by the way, hears no one's prayers and never has.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:14.140]   But it strikes a blow against the very compassion of Christ and the compassion of God.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.860]   Reconciliation is by the will of God.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.380]   He had to design the means, right?
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.820]   He's the one offended.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.500]   If there is to be reconciliation, we can't design it.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.300]   The offended one has to design it.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.900]   And God our Savior, who will have all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, has
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.340]   designed a means of reconciliation.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:45.220]   So the good news is when you go out as an ambassador of Christ to speak about reconciliation,
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:52.100]   you have the full force of heaven on your side as God, through you, is speaking.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:19:01.780]   He actually says that, "God speaking through us, be reconciled to me."
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:08.380]   I would hate to think about having a job like convincing sinners of reconciliation if I
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:20.460]   also had to turn and convince God and get Him to ease up, but that is already a given.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.500]   That is already a given.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:29.800]   And He demonstrated it, obviously, in that He sent His Son to be the sacrifice.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.020]   We'll see more of that in a moment.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:38.460]   So reconciliation is by the will of God.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.620]   You're doing God's work.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.500]   You're preaching God's message.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.940]   And He literally is speaking through you.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:57.100]   It's in verse 20, where it's God making an appeal through us.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.460]   We beg you.
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:08.260]   When we beg sinners to be reconciled, that is God begging sinners through us, a marvelous
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.260]   reality.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:21.100]   And again, only in Christianity do you have a God who is by nature a Savior.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:25.020]   So reconciliation is by the will of God.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:31.060]   Secondly, it is by the act of forgiveness.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.900]   It is by the act of forgiveness.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:46.420]   In order to be reconciled to God, verse 10 says, "God stops counting your trespasses
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.980]   against you."
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.380]   This is amazing.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:21:00.140]   A holy God who has every right to punish sin, and every sin ultimately is punished, forgives
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.220]   you.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:09.860]   The forgiveness of sin, what we're talking about in the gospel is forgiveness.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.500]   We're not talking about a happy marriage.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.940]   We're not talking about a better life.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.900]   We're not talking about prosperity.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.980]   We're not talking about some kind of soul satisfaction.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.940]   We're not talking about purpose, purpose-filled life or whatever.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.180]   We're talking about forgiveness.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.540]   And the only way you can ever be reconciled to God would be to be forgiven.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:34.500]   I mean, that should make sense because it works that way pretty much in the human realm,
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.860]   doesn't it?
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:43.100]   When you have been violated, when you have been assaulted, when you have been mistreated,
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.740]   if there's ever to be a restoration of a relationship, it's going to come through the path of forgiveness.
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:56.140]   And reconciliation is by the act of forgiveness.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:04.980]   You find that back in Psalm 32, Psalm 51 as David pours out his heart pleading for forgiveness.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:11.240]   You find it in the New Testament where Jesus forgives sins.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.740]   You find it in the epistles where the Apostle Paul says that Christ came for the forgiveness
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.660]   of sin.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:28.960]   This is the essential reality that makes reconciliation possible.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:36.580]   So I remember talking to a Muslim one night and I was reading a Bible.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:46.340]   I was flying to Texas to do a men's conference and I was looking at my New Testament and
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.140]   this Muslim guy was sitting next to me.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:54.220]   He kept looking over and glancing over and glancing over and finally he said, "Excuse
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.700]   me, sir, is that a Bible?
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.860]   Is that a Bible?"
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.700]   And I said, "It is a Bible."
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:12.820]   And he said, "Well, what is the religion of America?
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.020]   Is it from the Bible?"
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:22.900]   I said, "Well, mostly."
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:29.100]   But I said, "Let me tell you what the message of the Bible is by asking you a question."
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.940]   I said, "You're a Muslim?"
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.940]   "Yes," he said.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:39.820]   I said, "Do Muslims have sins?
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.180]   Do you have sins?"
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.620]   "We have sins.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.620]   We have so many sins I don't even know all the sins."
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.060]   So I said, "Do you do them?"
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.780]   "I do them all the time."
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:24:00.500]   In fact, I'll never forget this line, he said, "I'm flying to El Paso to do some sins."
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.940]   I said, "Oh, I wasn't sure I needed all that information.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.380]   You're flying to El Paso to do some sins?"
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:16.300]   He said, "Yes, I met a woman there when I immigrated through the naturalization gate
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:22.500]   in El Paso and we're planning to do some sins."
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:28.060]   So now I was in pretty deep.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:35.500]   And I said, "So what's Allah going to do about you doing sins?
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.200]   What does Allah think?"
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.180]   And he said, "It's very bad.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.900]   It's very, very bad.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.980]   I could go to hell.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.580]   I could go to hell."
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:54.500]   So you could go to hell and you're doing those sins anyway.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:01.780]   "Yes, I can't help it."
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.780]   I said, "Well, do you have some hope you can escape hell?"
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.700]   And this is the second line that I'll never forget.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:19.820]   He said, "I hope the God will forgive me."
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:27.600]   And I said to him, "Well, I know him personally and he won't."
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.660]   And he looked at me like, "You're in the middle seat on Southwest and you know God?"
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:38.600]   Well, he didn't even understand that kind of a statement.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:45.360]   You know, if you knew God, you'd have your own jet.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.660]   You wouldn't be in the middle seat on Southwest, no.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:26:01.960]   I said, "Yeah, I do know God and I know him personally and he won't forgive you unless...unless."
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.660]   And I poured out the gospel to him.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:18.780]   And I could tell him with confidence that God will forgive your sins if you come to
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.980]   Christ.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.200]   I can tell him that.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.600]   That's what Jesus meant when he said to Peter, "You have the keys to the kingdom."
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.400]   He didn't mean you can open the kingdom yourself by any means.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.440]   He meant you have the keys, the gospel.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.040]   You have the keys to the kingdom.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.480]   It's the gospel that unlocks the kingdom.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:48.600]   It's the gospel that opens the narrow gate to the narrow way.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.100]   So I told him there was complete forgiveness in Christ.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:57.560]   He couldn't believe that he could know there was full forgiveness.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.820]   I don't know what his response was.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.880]   I got his address, sent him a lot of material, never heard back.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.960]   But it's always a wonderful thing to be able to say to the sinner, "All you have to do
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:18.440]   is come to God through Christ and he'll forgive all your sins, past, present, and future."
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.960]   So reconciliation is by the will of God, by the act of forgiveness.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.880]   And then there's a third aspect here.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.280]   It is by the obedience of faith.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.000]   It is by the obedience of faith.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.760]   We beg you, be reconciled to God through Christ.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.760]   Put your trust in Christ.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.640]   He is the only way.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:54.160]   There's no salvation in any other.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:01.040]   There's a picture of spiritual warfare in 2 Corinthians 10 that I've always found fascinating.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:11.160]   It kind of describes the spiritual battle in proclaiming the gospel, 2 Corinthians 10,
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   3.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.840]   The Bible says we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.600]   And what that means is walking in the flesh, he doesn't mean carnality.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.200]   He means we're human.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:29.520]   Okay, so we're human, but we can't fight the spiritual war with human weapons.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:36.960]   In the next verse, "The weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.280]   for the destruction of fortresses."
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:46.960]   If you're going to lead someone out of the kingdom of darkness, if you're going to smash
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:55.080]   that fortress, you have to have something more powerful than human ingenuity.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.920]   We need something divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.080]   And what are those fortresses?
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:10.800]   Verse 5 explains, "Destroying logismos," speculations, ideas, theories, ideologies.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:17.080]   Every thing, lofty thing, high thing raised up against the knowledge of God and taking
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.720]   every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:27.920]   Literally, in order to reach this person and bring about the obedience of faith, we have
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:34.040]   to crush their present ideologies.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:45.780]   We have to destroy their speculations, theories, philosophies, psychologies, religions, worldviews.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:52.040]   And they are further defined as every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:57.680]   Any ungodly idea.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.840]   So in this ministry of reconciliation, you're going to run into the realization that you're
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.360]   going to need to lead someone to the obedience of faith in Christ, and that simply means
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:13.760]   to obey what the Scripture says about Christ and what Christ Himself says, which means
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:22.440]   that He's going to have to abandon His current ideology.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:30.560]   The word for fortress is the word for tomb, the word for prison, and the word for fortress.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:37.960]   People's ideological fortresses become their tombs, for sure.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:46.140]   So this is where your ability to proclaim the gospel, to give them the truth about Christ,
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:53.800]   show them the Word of God concerning Christ, the Spirit of God can use that to shatter
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.720]   their fortifications.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:05.480]   And the fortifications are defined in a very simple way.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:11.440]   They're defined as anything raised up against the knowledge of God.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:24.380]   Any ungodly idea has to be smashed, has to be abandoned in favor of obedience to Christ.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.920]   So this is complete shift.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:35.440]   It's not adding Jesus to your life, it's the destruction of your life and the replacement
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.440]   with Christ.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:44.760]   That's why Jesus said, "If any man comes after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:56.320]   You abandon, you don't add Jesus, you abandon sinful ideologies, ungodly ideas.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:04.040]   This is where your ability to articulate the Scripture, some knowledge of textual proofs
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:13.480]   for the truth of the gospel, even some good tools of apologetics can be of help to you.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:19.620]   Because it's not just saying something like, "Jesus will make your life happier," and playing
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.800]   to emotion.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:28.700]   That's going to be a superficial move, the move of a moment with no lasting influence.
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:38.600]   If they're going to come to Christ, they have to abandon the previous fortifications.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.880]   They have to leave them behind.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.000]   And that's why Jesus said it's hard to believe.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.160]   It's hard to believe.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:55.760]   The disciples said to Him in Luke 13, "Are there only a few who will be saved?"
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:01.220]   Jesus said, "A few will find the narrow way."
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.740]   It's hard.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:08.280]   It's hard to hate your father, your mother, your sister, and John says in John 12, your
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.020]   own life.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.960]   Literally to hate your own life.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:20.840]   Whatever structure your life has, whatever ideological structure, whatever set of beliefs
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:28.140]   hold you intact for time and eternity.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.100]   If they're not the godly ones, they have to be crushed.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:39.220]   So evangelism is not something that is simple.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:44.980]   It's not enough to say, "Pray this prayer and you're in."
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.800]   There has to be a destruction.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.860]   And that can only happen when you bring the truth.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:34:00.660]   So there's only one, the sword, there's only one weapon to destroy error, and what's that?
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.780]   Truth, truth, truth.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:16.980]   So you bring the truth concerning Christ against the lies.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.760]   So what are we seeing then?
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.920]   Reconciliation is by the will of God, by the act of forgiveness, and by the obedience of
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.960]   faith.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:37.560]   Faith is the knowledge of a reality that allows me to entrust my life.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:48.080]   You have to learn Christ and unlearn everything else.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.920]   So this is the ministry of reconciliation.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:35:00.240]   There's one other very important term just to kind of wrap it up.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:07.300]   Reconciliation is by the will of God, by the act of forgiveness, by the obedience of faith,
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:14.740]   and finally by the work of substitution, by the work of substitution.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:23.300]   And for that you come to the final verse, verse 21, 15 Greek words that sum up all of
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.380]   Christianity, really.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:32.220]   He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.700]   of God in Him.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:42.500]   This is beyond any other reality, the essential reality.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:48.340]   If you understand that verse, you understand the gospel.
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:54.980]   Because the big question is, as Paul articulates in Romans, how can God be just and the justifier
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.740]   of sinners?
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.740]   How can He do that?
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:03.860]   If you put yourself in a court setting and a judge comes in and a criminal is brought
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.700]   into the court and a criminal said, "Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty."
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:21.620]   And the judge said, "Okay, I've heard your confession, I affirm you're guilty, but I'm
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:26.340]   going to forgive you and let you go."
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.460]   There would be an outrage in the court, right?
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:34.300]   Because a judge has one responsibility, to uphold the law, right?
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.460]   You can't do that.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.180]   That's not justice.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:47.220]   So God could be accused of being an unjust judge if you just go to Him and say, "Okay,
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:53.540]   forgive me, forgive me because I ask," and God said, "Okay, you're forgiven and that's
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:37:01.220]   it," then God would be a justifier but would not be just.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:09.780]   So how does God maintain His justice and also be the justifier of sinners?
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:19.180]   And the answer is in that verse, "He made Him," meaning Christ, "He, God the Father,
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.060]   made Him who knew no sin," who is that?
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:29.460]   Christ, the only person who ever lived in the world that knew no sin, "He made Him to
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.820]   be sin on our behalf."
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:41.160]   This is the great doctrine of substitutionary atonement.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.900]   He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.900]   What does that mean?
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:54.260]   Well, you hear some wacky preachers say, "Well, on the cross Jesus became a sinner."
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.300]   No, He didn't.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.780]   He's holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:06.660]   And He validates that on the cross because at the pinnacle of His suffering on the cross,
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.580]   He says, "My God, my God, why have you," what?
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:18.340]   "Forsaken me?" and if He was a sinner, there would be no reason to ask that question.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.560]   He's not a sinner.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.140]   What does it mean that God made Him to be sin on our behalf?
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:32.220]   It simply means this, that God punished Him for the sins of all who would ever believe.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.820]   This is substitutionary atonement.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:40.620]   God literally punished His Son for the sins of all who would ever believe through all
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:47.260]   of human history before, during, and after He lived on this earth.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.940]   Peter puts it this way, "He bore in His body our sins on the cross."
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.620]   Isaiah puts it this way, "He was wounded for," what?
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:05.100]   "Our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, chastened for our shalom."
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.460]   This is the great truth.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:13.620]   All sin is punished because God is just, and it's either punished in the sinner who committed
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:20.780]   it or punished in the substitute who took the sinner's place.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.620]   This is an incredible truth.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.380]   Let me phrase it another way.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:36.500]   God treated Jesus on the cross as if He lived your life.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.340]   Can you grab that one as a sinner?
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:47.420]   He treated Christ on the cross as if He lived your life, and He unleashed the horrors of
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:57.180]   judgment, and the darkness lasted three hours, and for three hours Christ bore the full punishment
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:05.060]   for all the sins of all the people who would ever believe through all of human history.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:10.820]   Sinners in hell will forever be in hell, and the punishment will never be complete.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:15.260]   Christ completed the punishment in three hours for everyone who ever believed in human history.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.260]   How is that possible?
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.660]   And the only answer is because He's an infinite person.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:30.380]   He had an infinite capacity for everything, including punishment.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.820]   So God treats Jesus as if He lived your life.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.820]   You know, when I say that to a sinner, it's a pretty shocking thing.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:46.820]   But that's not all, because the second half of the verse says so that He might become,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.980]   so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.460]   What does that mean?
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:41:00.860]   He treats Jesus as if He lived our life, so He can treat us as if we lived His.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.340]   Amazing.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.340]   That's what Isaiah 66 is talking about when it talks about being covered with robes of
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.380]   righteousness.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:18.060]   God looks at Christ and sees you and is satisfied with the punishment.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:23.700]   God looks at you and sees Christ.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:32.580]   This is the monumental doctrine of imputed righteousness that goes along with the doctrine
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:38.320]   of imputed sin.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:44.820]   That's a great exchange.
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:51.340]   So when you think about the ministry of reconciliation, it all comes down to God being just and the
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:58.940]   justifier of sinners, which means He must punish sin, and He did it in His Son so that
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.940]   He could forgive us.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:06.340]   And when He forgave us, He really forgave us.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:13.380]   He permanently forgave us because the punishment was paid in full by Christ.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:18.600]   And when He sees us, He sees His Son.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:26.380]   That's why the Bible talks to us about believers being joint heirs with Christ.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:31.300]   This is the good news that sinners need to hear.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:37.540]   And of course, it's why our salvation is forever, because Christ bore the full punishment, no
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.120]   double jeopardy.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:49.100]   And it's why true believers never defect, because we literally are covered by the righteousness
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.060]   of Christ.
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:43:02.020]   People who defect, John says, never were of us, 1 John 2:19.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:12.620]   So this incredible ministry of reconciliation, this message of reconciliation is the heart
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:18.980]   and soul of our calling as ambassadors in this alien world.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:24.660]   And whatever your circumstance, you know, in my case, you could say, I have it easy.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.160]   I'm talking to people who love me.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.620]   In your case, you might be talking to people who hate everything you're saying.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.980]   And Jesus said that, John 7, 7, He said, "They hate me because I tell them their deeds are
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.060]   evil."
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.260]   It's that issue of sin that generates the hostility.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:54.460]   I mean, just imagine standing up in a media environment today and being honest about homosexuality,
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:44:00.140]   LGBTQ, child mutilation.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:05.340]   I don't know how long you'd survive.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.420]   There's more to the message than that.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.260]   The message has to start with the reconciliation to God.
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:19.860]   And at that point, the Holy Spirit has to do the convicting of the sinner's heart, right?
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:27.700]   So my prayer for all of you is that the Lord will use you in ways that maybe you don't
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:35.460]   even expect to be His ambassador and tell sinners they can be reconciled to God.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:41.820]   And when it's something they want, then they give you the right to tell them how it can
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.220]   happen, right?
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.700]   Father, thank You for Your Word.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.260]   Thank You for Your glorious gospel.
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.180]   Thank You for saving us.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.500]   Thank You for these dear folks.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.380]   Lord, I pray that You will do exceedingly abundantly above all they can ask or think
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.740]   through their lives.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:06.060]   Use them in the environment they're in to do Your eternal work for Your glory.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:11.420]   Fill their hearts with joy in the privilege, we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.420]   Amen.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:16.460]   Would you like to take a couple of questions?
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.460]   Sure.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.460]   Ty Denne wondered if I'd take some questions.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.820]   I'd be glad to.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.420]   Maybe you need to catch your breath.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:25.220]   You didn't expect that.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.220]   About anything.
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.220]   Okay.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:37.220]   Yes, sir.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:48.220]   Thank you, Pastor, for the message.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:46:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.780]   You have no role in the doctrine of election.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.780]   Neither do I. Neither does anybody else.
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:16.380]   Spurgeon said when somebody complained, "Why are you preaching the gospel to everybody
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.380]   if some are elect?"
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.020]   And he said, "Because nobody has 'ye' stamped on their back."
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:26.500]   So, my responsibility is to preach the gospel to every creature.
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.660]   How God harmonizes.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.260]   Let me help you with that.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:35.860]   Because people say, "If God chooses, then how can the sinner have accountability?"
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:40.860]   I mean, that's a dilemma that ought to encourage you.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.980]   Because if you understood the mind of God, you'd be God, and if you were God, then God
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.220]   would be like you, and we'd be in a lot of trouble.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:51.660]   So you want a transcendent God.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.180]   But a way to explain it is this.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:58.300]   If I ask you, for example, "Who wrote the book of Romans?"
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:03.720]   That's a simple question that you would hesitate to answer, right?
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.860]   You want to say Paul, but you know you can't.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.100]   You want to say the Holy Spirit, but you can't say that either.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.100]   Why?
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.940]   Because every word is inspired by the Spirit of God, and yet every one comes out of the
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:20.140]   vocabulary and mind and heart of Paul.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:29.500]   Another way to look at it is if I ask you, "Who lives your Christian life?"
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.060]   Who lives your Christian life?
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.780]   Do you live it?
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.100]   Yes.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:41.180]   That's the point.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.980]   Because you have the exact same apparent paradox.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:53.120]   Anything that brings the divine into the human contact in the realm of redemption leaves
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:57.420]   you with that same apparent paradox.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:01.220]   Paul says it this way, "I am crucified with Christ.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:07.580]   Nevertheless, I live," and then he says, "Yet not I."
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.140]   Because even he doesn't get it.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.240]   "But Christ who lives in me.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.440]   Everything good in me, I give Him credit.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.740]   Everything bad in me, I take responsibility."
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:24.620]   So this is in every doctrine there is.
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:32.060]   If I say, if you're saved, do you believe in eternal security?
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.060]   You're secure.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:38.580]   Yes, because Jesus said, "All that the Father gives to me will come to me and I'll lose
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:42.380]   none of them, but raise Him at the last day."
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:47.540]   But we also read that we have to persevere in the faith.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:53.380]   So you have both of those things side by side, and that's plenty of evidence that this is
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:49:00.340]   a transcendent reality that extends beyond our scope.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.020]   I'm just glad to say this.
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:10.300]   God can use me, but He doesn't need me.
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:19.580]   He can use me, and I can have the joy of that and the eternal reward of that, but the saving
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.700]   He does.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.580]   And this is everywhere.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:28.980]   Everybody, everybody who reads the New Testament understands predestination.
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:33.700]   Everybody who reads the Old Testament, well, what is God calling Abraham out of the whole
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:40.140]   world of humanity and identifying a people from the loins of Abraham and not everybody
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.140]   else?
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:48.020]   Israel, my elect, Christ, my elect, the church, my elect.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:57.300]   At the same time we see that unfolding all through Scripture, we also see human responsibility.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.980]   How God harmonizes that is for Him to figure out.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.980]   Yes?
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:17.540]   >> I have a question regarding the university, not even specifically my area, because I saw
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.900]   for example, the university has incorporated psychology, which I believe most of them come
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.900]   from pagan books.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.900]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:25.900]   >> And actually the university program is not only one university, it's multiple, and
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:26.900]   many of them inside are even Christians.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:27.900]   So how do I...
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:34.900]   What's your suggestion or different counseling for people, students who already chose that
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.900]   area even as Christians, is the first question.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:44.780]   The second question is in China, for example, the whole education system is really imposing
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:45.780]   or even the theory to students.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.780]   You have to get A or even 100% of that to get into university, get better education.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:47.780]   So how do you, by the way, give some counseling advice to people in such program?
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:51:09.380]   >> Yeah, no, I appreciate the question, but I would just remind you that one of the strongest
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.780]   churches in the world is the Underground Church in China.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:16.860]   We have students who have come here from China.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.460]   We have students in the Master Seminary from China who are products of the Underground
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.740]   Church because the Lord can save His people wherever they are.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:32.420]   Whatever the ideology is, the Spirit of God can break through.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.260]   And that's happened in China.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.540]   And I saw the same thing in the former Soviet Union.
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:41.220]   Jeff was saying it was 60 times in the Soviet Union.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:47.660]   I wasn't there that many times, but I went a lot for conferences, and I met the Underground
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.100]   Church and the Aboveground Church, the Registered Church.
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:55.620]   And while communism was doing everything it could to stamp out Christianity, the church
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.320]   was flourishing and growing.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:05.340]   So it's a matter of taking the opportunity to proclaim the truth, and it's the work of
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:11.340]   the Holy Spirit to break down the fortresses.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.740]   But you need to have an answer to every man who asks you the hope, so that there's a reasonable
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:23.020]   biblical answer for what's wrong with that ideology.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.400]   But it doesn't matter what the ideology is.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.500]   You could say in America there's freedom.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:34.540]   The church in America, in my experience, is far weaker than the Underground Church I saw
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:35.540]   in Russia.
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.540]   That's not actually—sorry.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.540]   That's not my real question.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.540]   I'm not really concerned about their faiths.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:39.540]   I think they're really like after fire, they're more pure.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.540]   But really, do you suggest them, like, practically speaking, get out of that discipline of psychology,
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:41.540]   or how do you practically—?
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.540]   Well, look, there are some things in psychology that are helpful.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:53:11.180]   The study of human behavior, educational psychology, there are things about human behavior that
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.860]   can be cataloged and understood.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:22.860]   But when you try to define the deepest issues of a human being with something like psychology,
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.420]   you're never going to get there.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.860]   You're never going to get there.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:31.180]   And that's why, to be honest with you, the whole counseling movement has disappeared.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:37.460]   No psychologist or psychiatrist that I know anything about does any counseling anymore.
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.420]   They just give you drugs.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:48.300]   I mean, they can't deal with anything.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:53.820]   But that's not to say that there aren't psychological reasons how people learn or
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:57.980]   how people are made more effective in any kind of skill.
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:03.860]   Sure, there are elements of human behavior that have been studied and need to be studied
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:08.800]   and can be helpful in understanding how to navigate in the world and all the relationships
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   that we have.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:16.380]   But when it comes to sin and righteousness and judgment, psychology offers nothing.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.660]   Yes, sir?
[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:24.260]   You've written quite a bit in your life, in the past.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:38.900]   When is it that something triggers you and you say, "I need to expound on this and
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:39.900]   get this out to the public"?
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.900]   Well, it can happen a lot of ways.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.940]   It almost all starts from my preaching.
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:54.940]   When I preach something or through a subject or a passage, and I feel that this is speaking
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:55:04.460]   directly to not just something that's always around, but maybe a more dramatic moment in
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.420]   the life of the church or the life of the nation or the world, I might say, "You know,
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:14.540]   this needs to go into print."
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:19.940]   Sometimes it's just in the flow of things like commentaries and study Bible and all
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:20.940]   that.
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:21.940]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:26.980]   Right now, I'm working on a book called "The War on Children."
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.260]   So that's obvious, right?
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.540]   I mean, somebody's got...
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:38.740]   And the challenging thing with the book on "The War on Children" is if you try to describe
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:47.020]   how bad it is, no matter what you say, you're one week behind something worse.
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:50.860]   So you can't chase the tale of that.
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:54.900]   But yeah, it can be an issue like that.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:59.500]   That is a very dramatic issue that needs to be addressed because people need help.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:07.100]   And I really do write for people who want an answer from the Word of God.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:15.220]   Sometimes the people around me, elders, pastors that I work with say, "This is a subject you
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.860]   need to work on."
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.900]   So it can come from a lot of angles.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:26.100]   But it's got to be something that is in my heart because I have enough things to do that
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:30.820]   I won't get it done if I'm not highly motivated.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:38.500]   Pastor John, thank you so much for being here with us today.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.500]   My pleasure.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   Thank you.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:48.860]   If you could stay here for a little bit because I want to ask you to close us in prayer.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:55.100]   But it sounds like we have your permission to hold the Mathema Symposium next year again.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.460]   For whatever good my permission is, you have it.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:59.460]   Well, thank you.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.460]   We appreciate it.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:01.660]   And I want to thank you all for coming.
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:06.340]   And I know some of you traveled very, very far from Northern California and even as far
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.860]   as the East Coast to be here with us this weekend.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.080]   So we really appreciate it.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.180]   If you're going to be in town all weekend, we actually have in the bulletin a list of
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:19.820]   local churches if you're going to be around tomorrow, including Grace Community Church
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.820]   where Pastor John will be speaking again in the morning.
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.580]   There's also in the back a list of ways to stay in touch.
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.820]   So a year is a long time to see you all again.
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:32.100]   But we have a mailing list.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.620]   There's a QR code so you can sign up for that.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:38.540]   If you're interested in contributing an article for the Mathema Journal, we spoke about that
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.540]   yesterday.
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.340]   Please, we would love to get in contact with you.
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.740]   There's a website there.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:52.660]   Oh, and it turns out, we do have several open positions in the Science and Engineering Department
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.660]   here.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:57.540]   So if you have ever thought about, or maybe after this weekend, interested in joining
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:03.060]   the TMU faculty, or you have no friends or colleagues, please feel free to point them
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.420]   to that.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:08.980]   Last thing, really quickly, this fall, we have another event that may be of interest
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.420]   called the Theotech Conference.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.900]   That's theology and technology.
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:19.060]   And Dr. E., can you remind us really quick of just what the topic is, and maybe what
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.060]   day it's on.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:26.900]   Theotech, 2023, October 28th.
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:34.780]   This year's theme is intelligence, creation, evidence.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:39.180]   What is intelligence?
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:42.100]   How is it created?
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.380]   Where is the evidence?
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:46.220]   Be there.
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.380]   Okay.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.980]   Thank you, Dr. E.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:55.140]   And I want to thank our speakers for coming, Tara, and Jeff, and Abner, and Pastor John
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:58.620]   and Mark for being here with us this weekend, and for all of you.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:59.620]   So thank you.
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.620]   And Pastor John.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:10.460]   And we need to say thanks to Tye Denae, she's here.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.460]   Special gift to us.
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.420]   Would you mind praying for us and our guests today?
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.420]   I'm glad to.
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:18.980]   Father, we are so grateful for the truth.
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:20.660]   What can we say?
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:21.980]   The truth is everything.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.820]   It's absolutely everything.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:29.380]   And it settles our hearts for time and eternity.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:37.140]   Thank you for the joy and the peace, the contentment, the wonder, the anticipation, and the hope
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.060]   that comes from knowing the truth.
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:47.820]   We thank you for every individual who is here, and we pray that there will be opportunity.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:52.580]   Just immediately we ask, Lord, for them to put into usefulness and practice some of the
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:58.620]   things that they have learned or refined in the time here.
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:06.380]   Make this a useful, helpful opportunity that will allow them to be more effective in everything
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:13.380]   that they do, and particularly in the ministry of reconciliation to which you have called
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.040]   us all.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.380]   And may they see fruit for their efforts and their labors.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.500]   For your glory we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:32.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
