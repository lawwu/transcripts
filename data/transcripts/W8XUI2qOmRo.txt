[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040]   - We have a question from Matt in Houston, Texas.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.880]   Recently, Pastor John, you spoke on the prosperity gospel.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.000]   I'm moving to Africa at the end of this year
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.280]   to be a missionary in Zambia.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.560]   The prosperity gospel is on every street corner there.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.560]   It's ingrained in the people.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.020]   Africans don't deny the spiritual world
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.800]   like many Americans do.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.080]   They just wanna know who is more powerful,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.200]   Satan or Jesus?
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.120]   And the prosperity gospel is one way of saying Jesus is.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.160]   So the question is this,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.520]   how would you encourage someone
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.800]   to address the prosperity gospel errors
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.040]   in a spiritual power-based nation
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.800]   like many of those in Africa?
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.600]   - Yeah, well, right off the bat,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.880]   the more I think about this,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.880]   and I think about it a lot
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.160]   'cause everywhere I go, I run into it.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.000]   The more I think about this,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.280]   the more I realize prosperity preachers
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.360]   are not preaching a very powerful Christ.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.640]   They're not.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.880]   He's not nearly powerful enough,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.120]   not nearly sovereign enough over Satan.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.520]   So let me see if I can get at this.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.400]   The way I approach this is not to tear down
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.760]   the positive claims of the prosperity gospel,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.680]   but to present the parts of the Bible
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.440]   that they leave out and show them
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440]   that the glory of Christ and the greatness of Christ
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.280]   and the power of Christ and the superior worth of Christ
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.920]   is more clearly displayed
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920]   when these texts are taken seriously.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.480]   They leave out so many texts
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.520]   that have to do with the glory of Christ.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.120]   They think they're presenting a more glorious Christ,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.080]   and they're not.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.360]   They're not.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.480]   Now, of course Christ is stronger than Satan.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480]   Of course he's able to stop disease and still storms
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.160]   and cause rain to fall and prevent crime
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.560]   and open blind eyes and prison doors
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.040]   and shut the mouths of lions and halt malaria
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.920]   and make airplanes stay in the air
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.480]   and a thousand other things.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.400]   But do the prosperity preachers really believe
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.000]   in the absolute sovereignty of God over Satan?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.720]   I don't think they do.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.600]   So there are two things I would teach
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.440]   on those street corners in Africa or anywhere else.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   Hawaii, I just got back from there.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.360]   And they are very closely related.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   I would lay out all the texts
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.360]   on the absolute sovereignty of God
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.400]   and all the texts on God's control
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.480]   and God's design for suffering.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.280]   I think these are the two underlying deficiencies
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.880]   in the prosperity preaching,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.840]   a biblical understanding of God's sovereignty
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.480]   and a biblical understanding of God's purpose in suffering.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.400]   Now, in regard to sovereignty,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.640]   the prosperity preachers speak of God's power
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.360]   to bless and to make you prosper.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.000]   But in the end, it's man who pulls the string.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.360]   Man is decisive, not God.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.720]   Because if you don't prosper, it's always your fault.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.600]   It's always your doing, not God's.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.120]   This is not divine sovereignty.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.120]   This is divine frustration.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.960]   God wants to bless, but he won't.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.800]   He can't.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.880]   Because you won't do the right things.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.560]   This is magic.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.800]   With man as the all-powerful magician, medicine man.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.080]   Man has become the witch doctor, the shaman here.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.760]   This is just old-fashioned magic.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.880]   This is voodoo with man poking the needles
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.600]   and God just responding
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.080]   whenever man pokes in the right place.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.160]   This is not a sovereign God.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.120]   The prosperity gospel doesn't go
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.400]   to the heart of the sovereignty issue.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.720]   So they talk about power all they want.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   But what we need is to see the absolute sovereignty of God
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.800]   made plain to them.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.720]   And that means showing them texts,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.440]   not just about the power of God over Satan,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.080]   but power over the smallest events,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.640]   like the bird falling out of the air
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.320]   and the roll of the dice in Reno, Nevada,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.800]   or the picking of the lot in the lap, as Proverbs says.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.200]   Sovereignty over man,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.520]   specifically man's will.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.560]   That's absolutely essential that that be taught.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.400]   If you want Christ to be sovereign,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.600]   He's not just sovereign over a few things.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.240]   He's sovereign over all things.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.640]   "The king's heart is a stream of water
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.720]   "in the hand of the Lord.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.160]   "He turns it wherever He wills," Proverbs 21.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.800]   So then it depends not on human will or human exertion,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.160]   but on God who has mercy, Romans 9, 16.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.240]   So preaching the absolute sovereignty of God
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.720]   would show prosperity preachers.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.760]   You don't preach a powerful Christ.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.160]   You preach a wimpy Christ, for goodness sakes.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.680]   He's not in charge.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.480]   Man is in charge in your scheme.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.800]   And that leads to the second great deficiency
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.360]   of the prosperity preachers.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.960]   Since they don't go deep enough
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.160]   with the sovereignty of God,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.080]   they don't go deep enough
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.760]   with the sovereignty of God in suffering.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.560]   And therefore they don't deal with the passages
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.600]   that teach about God's purposes in suffering.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.080]   When I have dealt with people,
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.920]   like I did with one family from India,
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.920]   who had never heard anything but prosperity preaching,
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.280]   I just spent a half an hour with them
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.720]   showing them passages of Scripture on suffering.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.200]   And they were blown away.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   They said they had never heard or seen anything like this,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.920]   that God actually has some purpose or design
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.720]   in their suffering.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.640]   So since prosperity preachers don't think
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.200]   He controls suffering,
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.240]   they can't see any purpose or design in it.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.080]   They never teach on the design of God in suffering.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.440]   The Bible's full of His design in suffering.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.520]   I just came back from Hawaii
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.560]   and they asked me to preach on suffering.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.400]   And I did, and the whole thing was my just giving reason
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.160]   after reason after reason from biblical texts
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.840]   that God says He ordains or permits suffering in the world.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.920]   It's all over the Bible, but they can't talk about it
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   'cause it's not part of their system.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.960]   They're not biblical enough,
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.320]   which means that they leave people
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.680]   without the massive help that the Bible gives to sufferers.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.200]   And they dishonor Christ,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.520]   who intends to be magnified in our suffering.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.360]   So for example, just one closing example here,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.760]   2 Corinthians 12, where Paul has the thorn in the flesh,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.840]   which is called a messenger of Satan.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   And yet God uses it to bring holy, humbling,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.600]   to Paul, which means He turns Satan
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.440]   into a servant of sanctification.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.080]   He makes Satan serve holiness,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   which must just gall Satan when God so sovereignly rules
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.000]   over his thorn that He makes it turn Paul
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.560]   into a humbler, more Christ-like person.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.640]   And then here's the nub of the matter.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.520]   Jesus says to Paul when He says,
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.760]   "No, I'm not gonna take your thorn away."
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.640]   He says, "My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.320]   My power," okay, now this is a power they never talk about.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.040]   "My power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.320]   Therefore," Paul says,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.200]   "I will boast all the more gladly in my weakness
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.440]   so the power of Christ may rest upon me."
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.240]   Yes, oh, we believe in a very powerful Christ.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.400]   And He is shown to be more magnificently powerful
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.800]   in satisfying the suffering soul
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   than He is in giving BMWs to the worldly soul.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.120]   Do prosperity preachers ever show this power of Christ,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.960]   the power to satisfy the suffering soul
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.520]   with the superior majesty and presence of Christ?
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.840]   So that's my approach, Tony,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.480]   and to the brother who asked about going to Africa.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.680]   Teach on total sovereignty
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.960]   and not just bogus power preaching
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.040]   that gives man the decisive power over God.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.920]   Teach on God's control over and the design of God
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.840]   in suffering for His glory.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.800]   - Amen, that's wonderful counsel, Pastor John.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.640]   Thank you for that.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.800]   And thank you, Matt, for the wonderful question.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.240]   We talked about how to detect the prosperity gospel
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.040]   back in episode number 320.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.160]   In an episode, we titled "Six Keys
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.560]   to Detecting the Prosperity Gospel."
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.240]   Be sure to check that out for more details
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   on what this looks like theologically.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.400]   Tomorrow in the States, we celebrate Thanksgiving,
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.320]   and we will return on Monday to ask more of your questions.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.360]   But you asked, "Tony, I want a Thanksgiving-themed episode
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.200]   for tomorrow.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.440]   Do you have any suggestions?"
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.240]   Well, of course I do, always I do.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.720]   Episode number 225, you can find that in the app,
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.480]   episode number 225.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.960]   And speaking of thankfulness,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.080]   I wanna close out this episode
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.440]   by sharing my gratitude for you.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.920]   Thank you, listeners, for sending us
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.280]   your encouraging emails.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.400]   We read all of them, even if we don't respond.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.880]   So thank you for your encouragements and your prayers.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.360]   And thank you for asking great and thoughtful questions.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.200]   We need you to ask great questions,
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.760]   and you constantly deliver.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.320]   Also, thank you for listening every day
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.480]   so that you can share specific episodes strategically
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.160]   with your family and friends in the moments
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.640]   when they face serious questions in life.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.960]   Nothing encourages me more than to hear a story
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.560]   of how a listener opened their APJ app in a coffee shop
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.360]   or in a living room or in a kitchen
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.440]   to share a specific episode to care for others.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.640]   I love seeing how many of you
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.120]   strategically serve your friends
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.480]   because you have made the commitment
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.880]   to make Ask Pastor John part of your routine.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.960]   So thank you.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.520]   May your Thanksgiving celebration be full of gratitude
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.920]   for the abundant grace of God in your life.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.480]   We will see you on Monday.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
