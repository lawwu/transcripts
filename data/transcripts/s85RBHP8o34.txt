[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Josh from Bel Air, Maryland, at the same Josh, with the great question about digital and print Bibles, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   "Pastor John, in a recent podcast you mentioned the role fathers have in homemaking.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   I get annoyed with trivial activities such as watching TV, playing board games, playing Uno.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   But my family loves these activities.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Is it better to suppress my annoyance and participate in these activities,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   or is it just better for me to leave and just do the things I love like reading, writing, playing music?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Am I selfish because I do not care for these activities?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   What role does a father play in engaging in home activities regardless of his interests?"
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   You are not selfish for enjoying reading over Uno, but you would be selfish for reading in the bedroom while the kids want you to play Uno in the den.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   In other words, of course most of us would find a deeper, more lasting kind of pleasure in a significant book than in an insignificant game.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   But that's really not the issue here.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I think the most serious theologian in the world who has children at home should play with them.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   All kinds of play that are age appropriate.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And here's the main reason.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   When children are little, immature physically, emotionally, spiritually,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   they don't have a lot of categories for interpreting dad's joy.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   They don't have a category for deep joy immersed in John Frame's systematic theology.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   They just do not have it.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Someday they may.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Hopefully they will.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   But to them, that simply looks like withdrawn boredom.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It's not what they need to grow up and see.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   They will grow up and see that eventually.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   But right now, the category they have for "Is Daddy happy? Does Daddy love me?" is pretty simple.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   "Does he play with me? And when he plays with me, does he enjoy it?"
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Their categories are very narrow.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   On the floor with the blocks at one year old.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   A simple card game at three years old.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And so on, right up through the high school sports and the performances.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The children need to see daddy as happy.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Happy with God.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Happy in being with the family.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And of course, happy in worship at church.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And happy in devotions at home.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   If dad is morose, bored, withdrawn,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   he is saying that's what it's like to know God.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Or that's what it's like to be God.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   These little children are learning about, "Dad says he knows God."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Here's the kind of life and relationships it builds in our home.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So the hope is that later, when they see that board games are unimportant on a scale of global and eternal realities,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   they will transpose dad's humble play into a symbol of God's condescension to his children.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   To bless his children.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And the hope is that they will take daddy's happiness in play with them.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And see that our Heavenly Father is not begrudging of his time and his attention to his children.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And of course, the balance between playing and working and reading and meditating isn't simple.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Children have to be taught that life is not all play.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Daddy can't stay at home all day and play.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Gradually, children need to be brought into the real world of pain, pressure, self-denial, service, and sacrifice.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   But joy must be the bedrock of it all.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Little children need to see that.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   This is daddy's greatest challenge.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Do all things, this is Philippians 2, I think 15.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing that you may be blameless and innocent children of God
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   That's the challenge.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Is daddy doing all things without grumbling and disputing to show the children how to rejoice at all times because of Christ.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And to be aware, yes, there's great suffering in the world.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And yes, there's sacrificial love to be performed.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   But underneath it all is a God who says, "In my presence is fullness of joy.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   My right hand are pleasures forevermore."
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   So that's the bottom line.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Parenting, Tony, really is impossible.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   But with God, all things are possible.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah, so true.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I think I remember hearing you say that you relax by being productive.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Did you struggle with this when your kids were small?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I mean, was it hard?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Was this a battle for you to give up the more serious pursuits in the evening, the intellectual pursuits, writing, reading, poetry, etc.,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   and just get on the floor and play blocks?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You should ask them that.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I loved 530 to 715 every night, which was playtime.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   From 530 to actually 7, because I allowed the church to make committee meetings starting at 715.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I said, "Don't expect me before 715 because I'm committed to playing until 7."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And we ate at 530.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   So we could eat, say, in 20 minutes, and then we have a good hour and a half to play together.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And then I pack up maybe and head off to an elder meeting or whatever.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I loved those times.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I mean, I really did enjoy the kinds of things that my boys seemed to enjoy when they were little.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   All kinds of things on the floor in the living room during the winter and outside, every kind of sport possible when the weather was tolerable.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But to be honest, I think I would say they might have looked for me to be more accessible, say, on the weekend when I'm getting ready for a sermon or other times.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But as far as the playtimes go, God gave me the grace to really enjoy those times.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I think the boys probably look back and say, "Daddy really worked a lot."
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   He probably could have been more accessible.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   He probably could have been there more often.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   But as I look back, not only did I enjoy those times, I think I went to just about every game there was to go to in soccer and baseball and football, and I loved it.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I did not go to those games.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I really didn't.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I mean, I was the only parent there at 3 o'clock in the afternoon for typical soccer games and could get myself in trouble at the excitement with which I cheered for my son Ben, for example.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And so, yes, to be honest, there were times and seasons during the week or during the year when I wasn't as accessible as a typical dad might be or might have been wise to be.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But given what I thought I should be doing in terms of times of play in the evening that were sacrosanct, really belonged to those boys and Talitha then when she came along.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And then the games and the performances and the dramas and so on, I loved those, and I hope they knew that.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Yes, excellent.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for those wise words for dads.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Dad's joy plays a significant role in the home.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And on this topic, be sure to check out a valuable recent episode we recorded titled "Dad's Role in Homemaking," which was episode 255 in the Ask Pastor John podcast archive.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Next time we ask, "If God is sovereign over everything in our lives, is it true to say that he causes all of our sicknesses?"
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. See you tomorrow.
