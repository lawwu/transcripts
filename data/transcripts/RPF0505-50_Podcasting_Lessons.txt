[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.620]   Today on the show, I'm going to share with you some philosophy and some insight into
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.520]   the world of podcasting.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.220]   I've got 50 specific tips and pieces of advice that I hope will serve you to take your message
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:48.320]   out to the world and do it in a very effective way.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.360]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.160]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.760]   My name is Joshua and I am your host, special edition of the show today, not specific to
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.640]   personal finance content, no tax analysis here.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.400]   Today we're going to talk podcasting and it's my hope that even if you're not currently
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:20.400]   a podcaster, give me a chance on today's show.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.440]   One of my personal secret plans that I'm now sharing with you is that I want to encourage
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.160]   many more people to get involved in the world of production, of useful information, useful
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.520]   inspiration, useful teaching, etc.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.400]   One of the most incredibly positive trends for liberty and freedom today, liberty, freedom
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.680]   and prosperity is the democratization of information.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.380]   The fact that any individual today with the equipment and things that you already own
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.980]   can take your knowledge and skill and experience and share that publicly with the world.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.640]   This is powerful.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.680]   And in general, it's my conviction that it is a powerful force for good.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.520]   At times this seems to be a powerful force for evil, but in the end, good wins and I
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.960]   am very confident that we will see more and more of that.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.620]   I love to see the cartels that have controlled much of the historical shaping of public opinion
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:28.960]   broken by individuals like you and me stepping up and creating our own useful contribution.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.040]   I believe that podcasting is a very powerful way for you to do that.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.360]   And so I've continually sought to encourage many of you to begin podcasts.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.840]   I've gotten feedback from many of you that you've begun podcasting and I want to continue
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.240]   that because we're just getting started.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.360]   The trends are strong and we're just getting started.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.160]   There's been some – we're just getting started.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.680]   So today's episode I've got about 50 and I say about 50 because I lost count.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.480]   I don't know whether it's 43 or 47 or 63, but I've got about 50 specific suggestions
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.080]   that I want to walk through.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.800]   And give me a chance because you're not going to hear any discussion of microphone selection
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   here.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.720]   You're not going to hear any discussion of technical anything.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.480]   I'm going to do what I do best, which is talk about philosophy and tactic, that the
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.040]   things that are changing and the things that will change.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.680]   And I encourage you to know that I'm recording this in December of 2017, which means that
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   some of these things will change.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.480]   But most of them I think the principles that I have to share, the philosophy and the principles
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.300]   and the tactics will continue.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.300]   So let's start with number one.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.760]   I am more convinced than ever and I wish to convince you that podcasting is a powerful,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.400]   powerful medium.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.280]   Podcasting provides a tremendous platform for many reasons.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.720]   Audio alone is a powerful form of communication because there's an ability to express personality
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.900]   and context in the form of audio that is more difficult to do in other ways.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.640]   World writers are very good at conveying personality.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.240]   But that develops – that requires a level of writing skill and a level of experience.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.920]   Amateur and unsophisticated writers often struggle with this.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.320]   How do you convey a proper tone?
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.700]   Tone in words is very difficult.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.400]   Just think to the last crucial conversation that you tried to have via text message and
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.360]   you realize that so much of the tone is missing in the written word.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.840]   Much of our communication – I've heard estimates that 93% of our communication is
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.440]   nonverbal, meaning that when you're speaking to somebody, only about 7% of the actual communication
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.920]   involved is the words that are a part of it.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.720]   So of course the very best platform and medium for communication is going to be in person
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   one-on-one.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.200]   That's the way that you'll be able to have the greatest clarity of communication, the
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.480]   most powerful transfer of thoughts because you can really understand what somebody is
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.080]   saying and what they're thinking.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.360]   But sometimes there are disadvantages to having that interpersonal one-on-one communication,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.000]   especially when you're dealing with difficult subjects.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.600]   For example, many people are intimidated by having intense communication with somebody
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.040]   on a subject where they're not sure they agree.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.760]   So there's benefit in having a one-to-many conversation that's not simultaneous.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.240]   But how do you maintain that same quality of interaction?
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.020]   It can happen at times with a room full of people come as students and a teacher standing
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.020]   in front.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.280]   That has its place.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.800]   But that's a very expensive way to do things.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   It's very expensive to put an in-person teacher in front of a room full of people.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.400]   And it also requires a simultaneous presence.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.240]   Whereas if you move to a non-simultaneous communication methodology by recording it,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.860]   you open up many more things and you lower the cost.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.460]   That allows communication to go more broadly.
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.240]   And so now we move into the world of video being probably the very best way for somebody
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.200]   to communicate one-to-many and have the full context.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.920]   Because in video you can hear the words that are spoken and understand what's actually
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.500]   denoted by those words.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.080]   You can see the body language of the person involved.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.520]   You can hear the tone of their voice.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   But video has other problems.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.800]   It requires that full attention between a listener and a speaker.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.520]   Also video is often unengaging.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.600]   We're so used to being engaged with our video that to put on a 60-minute lecture and try
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.960]   to give that full attention is very difficult for many of us.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.740]   Video also has a problem of it being very expensive.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.800]   It's expensive to create.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.500]   It's hard work to create good and compelling and engaging video.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.640]   It's expensive to listen to in terms of the time that's required because it requires full
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.300]   attention to see and to hear.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:14.520]   And it's somewhat expensive to share, whether it's with how do you host it online, how do
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.080]   you share it, requires a lot of bandwidth, et cetera.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.340]   Now moving down the scale, audio fills that next platform where it's much less expensive
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.340]   than video.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.100]   It's less expensive for the publisher of the content.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.280]   You don't have to come up with an elaborate physical set that's going to look great.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.040]   You don't have to dress up.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.760]   You don't have to look great on camera and put on makeup.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.960]   You just have to simply record the voice.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:47.140]   It's much less costly for the hearer to consume because it doesn't require full attention
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.360]   and is much less costly to share.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:59.440]   But audio still has some superiority over text in the sense of context of the communication.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.320]   Audio has the ability to convey emotion in a way that written text often lacks.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.080]   You can hear somebody's voice and that helps you to understand more their phraseology and
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.880]   what they're actually saying.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:18.740]   I want you to listen to a classic example from the world of speaking and understand
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.900]   how important this is in your ability to communicate with your listener.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.060]   The classic example is this.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.060]   Use this sentence.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.860]   I didn't tell her you were stupid.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:37.580]   Now when written, I didn't tell her you were stupid, it's very hard to understand exactly
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.940]   what's being implied.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:46.660]   But now consider these different approaches to emphasis and the different meaning that's
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.260]   behind these words.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.580]   I didn't tell her you were stupid.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.620]   Obviously meaning that somebody else may have told her.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.740]   I didn't tell her you were stupid.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:07.340]   Meaning that most definitely I emphatically did not do this.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.420]   I didn't tell her you were stupid.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.760]   I may have implied it however.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.380]   I didn't tell her you were stupid.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.220]   But of course I may have told someone else.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.140]   I didn't tell her you were stupid.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.900]   I told her that someone else was stupid though.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.720]   I didn't tell her you were stupid.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.500]   I told her you're still stupid.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.860]   Or I didn't tell her you were stupid.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.700]   But I of course may have told her something else about you.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.820]   As you can see from this classic example, context and tone matters.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:02.340]   And there's a power that we have in verbal speech to convey meaning that doesn't exist
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:08.940]   in the written word, especially not from an unskilled writer.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.980]   Text has significant advantages over podcasting.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:17.820]   For example, in today's world, the written word is scannable, which is really valuable.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:23.180]   It's scannable by individual people who can quickly look over and grasp the content of
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.180]   the idea.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.420]   That means that your ideas will probably have a much broader impact.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:34.460]   It's also scannable by bots that will archive it and inventory it for a search engine.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.780]   And this in today's world is very important.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:44.040]   Text speech is shareable in a way that verbal communication is not.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.740]   If you write an essay that takes maybe 10 minutes to read, it can be a powerful and
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.940]   effective essay.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.980]   And that essay may go viral.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:57.380]   You may take the same content and pack it into a 30-minute podcast presentation with
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.660]   spoken word, and it may be way more powerful, but it's very hard for that 30 minutes of
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.140]   audio to go viral in today's world.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.060]   Talk about virality in a little bit.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:14.580]   But text does have some benefits, but podcasting has very powerful benefits.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.820]   And so I think it's valuable for us to focus on this fact and recognize that podcasting
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.500]   is powerful and tremendous.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:38.300]   I'm convinced one of the powers of podcasting is the ability for small audiences of people
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:46.140]   for ideas or for content to connect with creators.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:52.220]   In the past, when mass media was all about the masses, you would automatically build
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:12:02.020]   a fairly generic, vanilla piece of content that had to have broad general appeal and
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.120]   not be broadly offensive.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.860]   That was the world of mass media.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.020]   But that world is now destroyed.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.700]   And this is the fundamental thing that is blossoming.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:21.500]   It's the world of an individual creator being able to discuss ideas that are only appealing
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.380]   to a very small market of people.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:33.000]   When somebody with a niche interest is able to connect with others who share that interest,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.220]   it can create a much tighter bond between that person and between those two people than
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:48.340]   is created from the creators and the consumers in the world of mass media.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.460]   This is really, really powerful.
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.700]   Podcasting does this really well.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.580]   And there's a tremendous future in podcasting.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:04.020]   Next, podcasting as a marketplace has changed significantly in the last two years.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.860]   I want to give you some examples of that in just a moment.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.580]   Before I do, sponsor of today's show is HelloFresh.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.140]   This will be the last HelloFresh ad I do here during December of 2017.
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.300]   It's hard to think of a better time to do it, frankly.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:25.020]   Holiday time, is there a time when it's more helpful to have convenient and delicious food
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.060]   that shows up at your door in a nice brown box, comes insulated, of course, for the cold
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.300]   things in it, that you just put in the fridge?
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.580]   And then when you're ready to go out and make your recipe, you just go there and say, "Well,
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.580]   let's see.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.100]   Do I want to make the figgy pork tenderloin with green beans and rosemary potatoes?
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.820]   Or do I prefer the thyme gravy chicken with roasted carrots and cacio e pepe potatoes?"
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.700]   Those are some of the recipes that they're doing during the holidays.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.340]   HelloFresh is awesome.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.460]   You sign up and you choose what kind of food you want.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.900]   You can choose, do I want a family size or a two-person size?
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.300]   You choose from the classics or a vegetarian option.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.020]   And then once you choose that, you choose how many meals you want.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.020]   Once you set that up, they just ship you the food.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.540]   And the food comes, it all comes in prepared individual little packages.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.820]   Serving sizes are carefully measured out.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.140]   There are recipe cards.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.900]   And there's new recipes created constantly by great chefs that are delicious, that are
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.160]   simple.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.480]   And you put the recipes together, you cook it, and you serve really good food really
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.420]   quickly and conveniently.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.940]   And at this time of year, going through the holidays, it seems like especially the convenience
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.020]   has a huge attraction, at least it does for me.
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.020]   There's no perfect solution to everything.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:48.940]   HelloFresh is certainly not as easy as going out to dinner, but it's a lot cheaper.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:55.080]   And if you like being in your house, then I prefer it, especially with young children.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.700]   We go out to eat from time to time, but oftentimes, it's just easier to stay at home.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:04.820]   And when you get to eat great food at home yourself, it's really, really a good solution.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.820]   So give it a try.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:11.340]   Go to HelloFresh.com, sign up, get $30 off your first week of meals with coupon code
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.340]   RPF30.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.660]   Again, go to HelloFresh.com, use the coupon code RPF30.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.660]   Please make sure to use that code.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.660]   Number one, it'll save you $30, so that's our bribe to you.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.420]   Number two, it lets them know that their advertising campaign here on Radical Personal Finance
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.740]   is working.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.740]   And thank you for that.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.060]   Now, back to the changes in the podcast marketplace.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.980]   A few months ago, I was with some friends of mine who have similar experience as I do
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.400]   in the world of podcasting, been doing it about three or four years now.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.820]   And we were talking about the fact that we feel like dinosaurs, which is weird in a way,
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.260]   because there are people who've been podcasting for much longer.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:52.340]   But we also all shared the same thought, and that's we're not sure that if we were going
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:59.300]   to start again today, that what we did and have done would work.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.300]   I'm not sure, and I've recommended to people, and I've taken consulting calls with people,
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.540]   I've recommended to people that they not copy what I've done, because what I did in the
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.140]   beginning of Radical Personal Finance would not work, I don't think, in today's marketplace,
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.460]   or at least it would not work as quickly as it worked for me.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.620]   When I closed my financial planning practice in order to start Radical Personal Finance,
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.860]   it was a very expensive decision.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.340]   I closed a profitable and effective business.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.860]   But I did it for essentially one major reason in terms of the timing.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:36.900]   The major reason was I saw an opportunity to take advantage of an early mover advantage.
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.320]   And I felt like it would be worth it to take advantage of that.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.540]   In hindsight, I was right.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.500]   I did get to take advantage of that early mover advantage.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.020]   Now hear me clearly.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.260]   The world of podcasting is very young.
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.740]   Even today, I think there is still an opportunity for early mover advantage.
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.020]   But compared to three or four years ago, it's very different.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.100]   Don't let that put anxiety in your heart if you didn't get to take advantage of the same
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.220]   early mover advantage that I did.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.700]   Early mover advantage is only one of many types of advantages that you can build.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.940]   And today, I'm not even sure it's the most powerful.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.420]   The problem with being an early mover is sometimes you don't have as big of a marketplace as
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.740]   possible.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.100]   And sometimes you come in and you prove the idea, but then somebody else comes in with
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:33.620]   way more resources, with way better ability to capitalize on the concept, and they eat
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.620]   your lunch.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.180]   You're the old dinosaur that proved the concept, but you're stuck to the side.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.100]   That's happened to radical personal finance a little bit.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.300]   I've been amazed as I've watched other brands come in and capitalize on something that,
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:50.860]   in my mind, I and others proved out, but they do it better.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.860]   So don't let that hurt you.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.140]   But the marketplace has changed and it will continue to change.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.940]   You must know this.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:06.460]   It is no longer enough in today's world of podcasting for you to sit down and to say,
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.580]   "Hey, I'm going to sit down with a microphone and I'm going to interview somebody for an
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.460]   hour and I'm going to publish that to the internet, and all of a sudden people are going
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.880]   to listen."
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   Not enough.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.200]   The only exception to that would be is if you're in a very small market that has nobody
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.000]   doing that and there's a group of people who are desperate for your interviews on some
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.480]   weird esoteric subject.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.320]   But in today's world, that is simply not enough.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.160]   It's especially not enough for you to do it if you have bad audio quality, if you have
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.640]   bad interview skills, and if you're just boring as an interviewer.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.440]   Just not enough.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:50.520]   That ship has sailed and any show, even like mine, that use that as their foundational
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:58.120]   approach has found, is finding, and will find that that is not enough.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.660]   There has to be change.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.840]   So recognize that some of the advice that worked three years ago does not work today.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.440]   But there's a whole new market that's waiting for your innovative idea.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:17.080]   Next point, it is possible to build a business on podcasting alone.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.320]   It is possible to build a business on podcasting alone.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:29.400]   You can build a business that is a podcast and make a living.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:35.520]   You will, however, need to have a very effective and successful podcast, but it is possible
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.040]   for you to do.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.040]   Possible.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.840]   Very hard, but possible.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.680]   The reason I say that is because that was the question that I had a number of years
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   ago.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.200]   I remember at the time I had actually sent an email to Cliff Ravenscraft, who has a brand
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.400]   called the Podcast Answer Man, and I asked him that question.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.960]   I said, "Is it possible for somebody to build a business on a podcast alone?"
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.920]   He responded, I can't remember how he responded.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.680]   Yes, no, I had to go read the email.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.520]   But it is possible.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:11.960]   However, my next point, podcasting is a terrible business.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.680]   I repeat that point.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.520]   Podcasting is a terrible business.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:31.120]   Podcasting, however, no matter the size, no matter the scale, is a great support.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:39.080]   It's a great marketing support, and it's a great communications medium for a business
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:45.600]   if your interest is financial and profit related, and/or it's great support for your promulgation
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.680]   of an idea or an ideology if that's your area of interest.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:58.080]   So it is possible to build a business on podcasting alone, but podcasting is a terrible business.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.220]   The numbers don't work.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.440]   It doesn't scale for you just to say, "Oh, I'm going to create a podcast and maybe I'll
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.440]   sell some ads."
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.060]   Very, very difficult.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:11.160]   It will only work if you are in the top few percent of success for all podcasts.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.360]   Now that is where Radical Personal Finance is, and so therefore it has worked for me.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.360]   But hear me clearly.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.720]   I don't look at my podcast as a business.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:29.780]   I look at Radical Personal Finance as a business, which is led by a podcast that may be the
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:34.280]   biggest product that I currently have, but it's not necessarily going to be the biggest
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.780]   product in the future.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.740]   So think carefully through your business model and recognize that podcasting is a terrible
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.020]   business.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:49.900]   Podcast serves very well, however, as a leading product, as something for you to think, to
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.780]   lead with, and/or a supporting product, a way for you to have deeper communication with
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:01.740]   some segment of your customers or your fans or people who are interested in your message.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.180]   Don't think podcast only.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.420]   That's a real mistake, and that's one that I have made.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.700]   Don't think podcast only.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:22.700]   Think podcast and written word and video clips and images and email blasts.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.580]   Don't think podcast only.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:32.940]   The best way for a podcast to fit in today's world is as a component of an overall communication
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:38.740]   strategy for your company or for your ideology or for your political movement or for whatever
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.580]   it is that you're trying to do.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.660]   Don't think podcast only.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:48.380]   If you do, I think the results will be less than what they could otherwise be.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.900]   Most people will not sit down and just listen to every single one of your podcasts.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.780]   Some will, especially if your content's good.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.820]   I've had dozens and dozens of people who've told me they've done that with Radical Personal
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.780]   Finance, and I deeply appreciate their doing that and their support.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:14.220]   But in total, Radical Personal Finance has been hurt by my exclusive focus on a podcast.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.700]   Much wiser to see a podcast as a component of your communication strategy.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.100]   You want your ideas to infect the marketplace, and if you're going to do that, you need to
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.000]   present them in inappropriate ways for other people.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.620]   There is a small subset of the marketplace for the ideas that I have to share of people
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.980]   who enjoy listening to audio, who have the capacity to sit and to follow a discussion
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.980]   or an argument for an extended period of time, who have the time to listen to a podcast.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.500]   There's a small subset of people who are able to do that.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.340]   But there's a much bigger population that would be interested in my ideas if they were
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.140]   packaged in various formats.
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:58.980]   So one of those ways of packaging is the podcast, but those ideas also need to be packaged in
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:08.180]   small little articles, in pithy little sayings, in longer pamphlets and books, in short presentations
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.940]   accompanied by visual aids, in long presentations accompanied by visual aids.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.500]   And this way, if you're thinking about this broad-based strategy, you're presenting your
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:23.540]   ideas to the marketplace in a way that's palatable to somebody at their different times.
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:30.860]   And somebody can stay connected to your ideas in a way that fits their lifestyle.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.460]   And that allows the individual to choose based upon where they are.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:41.220]   There's a much bigger opportunity for ideas or communications when they're packaged in
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:47.580]   various formats than when they're only in the form of a podcast.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.460]   Now if you need to start with a podcast, that's fine.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.020]   If a podcast helps you to get to those other places, that's fine.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.660]   In many ways, that's what radical personal finance has been for me.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.540]   The most helpful thing about it has been a way for me to clarify my ideas, test ideas,
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.540]   etc.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.420]   And it's a format that works for me.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:10.820]   But it's a mistake to think podcast only.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.740]   Think podcast and.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:26.060]   Next, fit your chosen format to your goals and to your content.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.700]   Don't copy someone else's stuff.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:35.940]   Fit your format to your content and to your goals.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:42.860]   Oftentimes people will copy somebody's format without understanding what it actually is
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.020]   that makes a format successful.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.580]   I've seen this again and again in the world of podcasting.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.700]   They'll say, well, Joshua does his shows as hour-long monologues, so therefore I should
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.820]   do a show as an hour-long monologue.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.060]   That's a big mistake.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:08.080]   Some hour-long monologues need to be delivered as two-minute live Facebook videos.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.780]   And they're going to be much more effective.
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.660]   But then there's a place for hour-long monologues.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.540]   So think through what you're trying to do and what you're trying to convey, and then
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.980]   fit your format to that content.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.340]   Don't just copy somebody else's format.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.180]   Take inspiration from somebody's format, but don't copy it.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.980]   Think a little bit more critically about what would be helpful for you.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.980]   In a moment I'll talk about editing, but let me give you just a quick preview.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:47.540]   Some ideas would be so much better served if you spent four weeks creating and crafting
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:53.660]   and carefully editing something and releasing that carefully edited result than if you spent
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.100]   four weeks releasing the rough cut.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.380]   And personally I always struggle with this.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.980]   I always struggle to understand how impactful is the idea in its rough format versus in
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.540]   the careful, finally edited format.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.740]   You'll have to figure that out for yourself.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.660]   Sometimes it's better to spend four weeks doing just rough cuts.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.900]   Sometimes it's better to spend four weeks doing preparation and releasing that polished,
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.300]   final version.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.020]   Home movies are cool.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.300]   They have their place.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:28.140]   And not all home movies should be edited into a tightly crafted masterpiece.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:33.780]   But at the end of the day, when you go to a Hollywood movie that may move your soul,
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.140]   you don't want to see a home movie.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.580]   You want to see a tightly crafted masterpiece with every detail in place.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.500]   So think through what your content is and think through what your goal is and fit your
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.080]   format to that.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:53.220]   If you are trying to create masterful presentations on a specific subject that is probably going
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:59.860]   to stay static, then it would be best to create something that's more in the world of carefully
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.980]   and tightly edited.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.260]   On the flip side, if you're trying to create fast content on something that's up to date,
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:10.500]   maybe a political commentary on an hour by hour or day by day basis, in that situation,
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:20.040]   maybe it's better for you to be less careful with your editing and quicker and your competition
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.860]   is first to publication, something like that.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.100]   Here are my thoughts on length, people's obsess over length.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.500]   I am convinced this question is simple.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:38.020]   Make your length the appropriate length for your listener and for your content.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.820]   Think through what's the most powerful way for me to convey this idea and make your length
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.700]   fit that.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.300]   Don't obsess over something else.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.420]   I find it very frustrating when people live in a world of 60 minutes.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.180]   When television had to be 48 minutes, they could sell 12 minutes of commercials and so
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.620]   therefore you've got 48 minutes and you try to fit that format.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.620]   If you're not on radio and if you're not on TV, don't worry about the 48 minutes.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.540]   Make your content fit your length.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.380]   Adjust your length to fit your content.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.140]   One of my biggest, two of my biggest annoyances is number one, when there's something that
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:21.100]   is dealt with that could go on and it's valuable and it's cut short due to lack of time.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.260]   I'm sorry, if it's valuable, it's valuable.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.180]   But on the flip side, it's really frustrating when the content goes on too long.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.820]   I have been guilty of this many times.
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:32.820]   It's an art.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.840]   It's a studied, it's something that you have to study.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.280]   But here's my thoughts on length.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.820]   Make sure that your most important stuff is up front.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.380]   And this is where I think the podcasting marketplace needs to make tremendous improvement.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.460]   I studied a lot in the world of radio because when I just said I want to be a better broadcaster,
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.580]   I couldn't find much help in the podcasting world.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.500]   The podcasting world was filled with technical gurus and people who would talk about how
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.540]   to hook up cables and RSS feeds and the right kind of microphone to choose.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.420]   And that stuff bored me to tears.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.220]   But I couldn't find anybody who would talk about content.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.620]   And so in the first couple of years of learning how to be a broadcaster, I went and I studied
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.840]   and I did everything I could to try to find who are the people who have advised the radio
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.940]   industry.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.380]   And one of the things that the radio industry has gotten right is they've shown how important
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.460]   it is to be quick and straight to the punch.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.580]   Now, this is easier said than done.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:28.340]   It's easier for me to teach you what you should do than it is for me to model on a
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.180]   daily basis how it's actually done.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.180]   I try.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.400]   I've got a lot of room to grow.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.780]   But you need to think in terms of 30, 60, and 90 seconds.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.980]   You've got about a minute to two minutes to capture your listeners' attention, which means
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.060]   you need to be interesting.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:52.940]   You also need to be relevant, which is where I think the best way we serve our audience
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.460]   is to help our audience to filter by telling them, "Here's what I'm going to share with
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.700]   you in today's show," so you can choose whether you listen or not.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:06.300]   Put your most important ideas up front so that those who only listen to the first 10%
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.680]   of your show can grasp those ideas.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.620]   You want your ideas to be held.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.420]   It's not that you want someone to listen to your entire show.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.060]   You want your ideas to be held.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.580]   So put your most important ideas up front.
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.020]   And then go ahead and expand on them.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.340]   There's a time and a place for you to add all this different, all this expansion where
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.940]   you're giving them additional ideas, you're giving them clarification, you're delivering
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.620]   analogies, you're delivering additional meaning.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.620]   That's great.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.400]   But put that in the middle.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.160]   And then put your other stuff towards the end.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.580]   For example, you may have supporting materials.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.220]   My intention, we'll see how long this show goes, but my intention is to read an essay
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.820]   to you, but I'm not going to lead with that essay here up front.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:55.340]   I would lead with that essay either in a separate show as a support material or at the end of
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.000]   today's show.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.780]   So you lead with the most important things.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.060]   And this applies to every part of your content.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.060]   An example would be banter.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.440]   One of the biggest things that harms so many podcasts is there's so much banter, so much
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.620]   conversation up front that doesn't need to be there.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.780]   When I'm listening to a new show, I will over time become interested in the host.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.300]   I'll over time become interested in what's happening with the host, what are they doing,
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.140]   what's going on in their life, how are they, did they have children, how was their week,
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.340]   how's the weather?
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.960]   But I don't want to hear that up front.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.780]   Put that at the back end so that those who are interested in that can listen to it.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.780]   But make your length fit the content and think carefully about it.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:43.860]   However, you should pay attention to the fact that increasingly people have very short attention
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:49.180]   spans and it's best to be as short as possible.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:54.220]   If the subject involves more interaction, go deep.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.460]   But it is always best to be as short as is possible or as is practical.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.260]   The average commute in the United States of America is, what, they say 25 minutes, so
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.940]   let's call it 20 to 30 minutes.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:09.180]   If you can be consistently at that 20 minutes and under, then I think that is a sweet spot.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.460]   Now, that's hard for certain types of content.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.780]   That's hard for me.
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:16.080]   I've gotten better, but it's hard.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.420]   But that should be something that should be shooting for.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:28.140]   But don't, if your ideas are worthy of a three-hour podcast, make the three-hour podcast.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.140]   Next, thoughts on frequency.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:36.420]   The other big question is how frequently should I publish an episode?
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:42.900]   In short, make your frequency fit the type of content and also your capacity.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:48.540]   If your content is very timely, you're talking about politics or something that's changing
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:54.100]   on a day-to-day basis, then I think there your frequency is going to be set out for
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.140]   you.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.580]   In the past, I did a show called Why I Do a Daily Podcast and Why You Should Model but
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:04.200]   not necessarily imitate me, and I explained what the value that I saw was of creating
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   a daily show.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.380]   And by daily, I mean five days a week.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:10.380]   I pursued a Monday through Friday show.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:16.460]   I still, at the time, my reasoning was valid, but the podcast marketplace has changed.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:20.260]   And I think that this is a harder question than it was before.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.540]   Of course, many shows are weekly, and weekly is wonderful.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.140]   To do a show on a daily basis, I think you've got to really question that.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:33.580]   There are shows that have that value, and still, on a daily basis, you're going to be
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.540]   very connected with your audience.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.060]   That's the big power of daily.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.260]   But I think you lose people on a daily basis.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.780]   I know you lose people on a daily basis.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:48.020]   There are many people who get this sense of anxiety at not being able to listen to everything
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.540]   that you produce.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:55.380]   And this is where it goes back to the variety of content that you create.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:01.660]   If you have content in various forms that allows you to have that consistent contact
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:08.140]   with your audience, but not to have everything focused on the podcast.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.820]   And so in hindsight, this is the direction I'm moving with, need to move with Radical
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:17.900]   Personal Finance, and am moving, is to have a lot of content in a variety of forms, but
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.940]   the podcast shouldn't be daily.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.260]   It's too much for most listeners, and you'll lose, I think, a lot of impact from it that
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.020]   you would otherwise have.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.580]   I think I'll have more comments on this topic in about a year, because what's harmed us
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:36.980]   on this up till now is we haven't had good data on how much people actually listen to
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.540]   longer shows.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:44.100]   For example, on Radical Personal Finance, up till now, I've never had really good data
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.940]   on how many of my listeners who would start a one or a one and a half or two hour show
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.620]   would get from the beginning all the way to the end.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:57.180]   Of course, we could draw comparisons from other types of content, and we would say,
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.300]   "Well, it's probably not 100%," but we didn't have very good data.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.140]   That is changing as podcast statistics services are updating, and so we'll have much better
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.140]   data.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.180]   I do think that if you're going to be more frequent, that it's best if your length be
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.700]   shorter, especially if you want to reach a larger audience.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.420]   I have in the past, and my own personal experience has colored this, I have a high tolerance
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:28.180]   for lengthy content if I'm interested in it, and I have a high tolerance for lots of content
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.700]   in the past.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.700]   There was a time in my life at which I was a heavy audio listener, and I spent, I would
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.620]   guess on average, about 50 hours a week listening to audio.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:44.220]   Even to this day, I almost never listen to music, and I was single, and I drove a lot.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.180]   When I was driving, I was generally listening to audio, and/or when I was doing something
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:52.240]   that didn't engage my brain, I was listening to audio.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:58.780]   When I was listening to audio, I would listen at basically 2x or 2.5x speed, and so I would
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.100]   probably consume an average week for a period of several years, I could consume 50 to 100
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.940]   hours of audio.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:11.540]   That gave me a very high tolerance for shows that produce a lot of content, but most people,
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.060]   their lives don't fit those parameters.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.620]   Most people don't have the ability to listen to that much content that frequently.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:24.900]   And so, even today, my life, I don't listen to very much audio at all now.
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.580]   It's not that I don't want to, it's circumstantial.
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.740]   I no longer have a commute, I drive very little, and when I drive, I'm probably going to be
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.420]   with my wife or with my children.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.700]   And I love being listened to when people are with their families, with their spouses and
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:46.260]   with their children, but I personally have a rule that basically, not a rule, I have
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:52.100]   a practice that I try to adhere to as much as possible, where when I'm with my wife and
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.420]   with my children, I don't listen to outside influence.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.940]   That time to me is so valuable that I want to spend it in conversation.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:06.380]   I find that an empty car, a car that is void of music and void of podcasting, void of voices,
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.060]   inspires conversation.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.820]   And to me, the most important things I want to nurture are those conversations with my
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.220]   wife and with my children.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.220]   And so I don't listen to audio when I'm with my wife and with my children.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.620]   That means that in an average week, I probably at this point have about maybe three to four
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.180]   hours available to listen to audio.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.180]   Also because my work is generally engaging my brain, I don't listen when I'm working.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.760]   So that's different.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.060]   And so here I think you should consider your content.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:38.740]   If you look at the shows that focus heavily on long shows very frequently, they tend to
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.860]   be the kind of shows where you can hit or miss.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.860]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:47.300]   Maybe the comedians or people like that that you can, where you can just dip in and out
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.360]   and whether you miss any particular day doesn't really matter.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.360]   That's not my interest.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.780]   I have no interest in that type of content.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.700]   If you're creating that type of content, then you should consider.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.740]   But if you're not creating that content, if you're creating content related to ideas that
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.540]   you think are important or teaching that you think is important, then consider it and consider
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:09.980]   how is my ideal customer, how is my ideal consumer going to interact with this content?
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:15.540]   Let's take an analogy from the world of reading.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.960]   You've got to consider when you're writing a book, am I going to write on a scholarly
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.620]   level or on a popular level?
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.460]   Well, first, what kind of book am I going to write?
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.780]   Am I trying to write a novel?
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.180]   Is my novel supposed to be fun and fluffy and make me money?
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.220]   Is my novel supposed to just make people feel good or is my novel supposed to be hard hitting
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.120]   and make people change their world?
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.700]   Then what language am I going to write in?
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.300]   Am I going to write on a popular level from writing nonfiction?
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.740]   Am I going to write on a popular level?
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.860]   Am I going to write on a scholarly level?
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.380]   And in general, you're going to want to adjust your content to meet different audiences.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.960]   Best to have a short book that's on a popular level.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:55.820]   Then you write articles and magazines that will convey the substance of what you're doing.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:01.500]   You may have the very long scholarly book to help your intense students go into that.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.020]   That's the best way to think about content, especially if you're dealing in the world
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.740]   of ideas.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.140]   Virality.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:15.740]   One of the biggest challenges with audio is there's very little ability to go viral.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:22.620]   There has never once been a viral growth in radical personal finance.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:27.220]   I think it's best if you acknowledge and recognize this because it'll make a difference in your
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:31.820]   marketing mix.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.500]   Podcast episodes don't go viral.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.620]   Now can a podcast go viral?
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.140]   Maybe.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:46.180]   The only example that we generally ever can point to in this world is – what was that
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.540]   podcast with the story that – Serial.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.460]   The Serial podcast.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.740]   The Serial podcast in a way went viral.
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:00.100]   The challenge is that it wasn't viral in the – it was viral in the way that sometimes
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.540]   TV shows are viral, where the body of the show, whether it's a – what do they call
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.540]   it?
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:13.100]   The House of Games or Game of Thrones or some other of these types of – House of Cards
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:17.900]   and Game of Thrones, how these types of TV shows go viral and everybody talks about them.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.860]   That's the way that podcasts can go viral.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:25.620]   But individual episodes of podcasts don't really go viral and that has to do in my opinion
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:31.620]   because of the amount of investment of time on the listener for them to actually think
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.300]   and consider.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:38.220]   Articles on the other hand or short video clips can go viral so quickly.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.460]   An article that can get shared because as everyone is flipping through Facebook and
[00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.460]   Twitter and they – oh, great.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.460]   Let me retweet that.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.020]   Let me share that.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.500]   It happens in their in-between time.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.700]   So podcast episodes don't really fit into in-between time and even if they do, they're
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.340]   still not going to go viral because let's say you had a brilliant six-minute podcast
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.820]   episode.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.060]   Very few people are going to sit on their mobile device and just listen to six minutes
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:07.380]   of audio without accompanying visuals supporting the point.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:12.660]   So I think it's best to plan on the fact that your podcast will never go viral.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.060]   Don't plan on virality.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:21.500]   But maybe you can create some kind of useful ideas and content and package your content
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:27.620]   in a way that will help the show to gain public exposure.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.540]   So this would be where and why it's important to not focus all of your energy on just podcasting
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.200]   but to focus some of your energy on other methods of communication that do have the
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.380]   possibility of going viral.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.140]   I've never found a podcast that's gone viral.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.720]   Now it may happen more in the future other than what I've said.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.660]   It may happen more in the future because the base of podcast listeners is growing and as
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:55.500]   bigger names get into podcasting, then podcasts can grow more quickly.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.260]   I'm reminded here of watching Ben Shapiro's podcast.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:03.500]   Ben Shapiro was a well-known young conservative commentator and then he recently started a
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:08.140]   podcast and his podcast just rocketed up in terms of listenership.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.780]   And so I think in the future it will be more possible but that's because of the nature
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.420]   of his content.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.260]   Political junkies are going to be interested in it.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.760]   His age and the people to whom he appeals and the fact that there's a growing and increasingly
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.920]   broad and growing base for podcasts.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.460]   Another one I watched was Jocko Willmick.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.260]   Just he was everywhere.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.040]   But his virality didn't come from the podcast.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.720]   It came from his being everywhere and having a unique idea at a certain point in time.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.420]   So in terms of virality, I don't know of any way you can make your podcast go viral.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:46.320]   But if you have a podcast and then you come along at a fortunate time where you create
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:53.260]   something that fits the cultural moment and you can build the PR machine behind it like
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.300]   some of these big names do where it's a very skillful approach to public relations and
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:03.020]   you appear everywhere, then the show can grow very quickly.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:11.540]   There's no reason today whatsoever for you to not have great audio quality from day one.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.340]   I didn't used to be an audio snob.
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:18.300]   To this day I still care more about the quality of the information than the quality of the
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.680]   presentation in general.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:27.320]   But it has become so easy today to have fantastic audio.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:33.140]   There's no reason whatsoever for you not to have great audio quality.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:39.900]   Intros, themes, music, all that stuff in my opinion is overrated.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.220]   I go back and forth.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.180]   Sometimes I use intro music, sometimes I didn't.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.700]   When I was first building the show, I thought, "Okay, I just bought some intro music."
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.780]   And then I thought, "Well, I need to make sure that I figure out how to make this intro
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:55.380]   music fantastic and I'm going to make it better and I'm going to get some professional voiceover."
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:03.140]   Think carefully through your particular ideas, your particular podcast.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.600]   But I think that in many ways, the faster you get to the point, the better.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:18.900]   It pains me when podcasts have lengthy 60-second intros that don't help and keep another 60
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.340]   seconds between the listener and the content.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.400]   In many ways, there's no reason not to just get straight into it.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.740]   When somebody's listening to a podcast, they've made an intentional choice to consume your
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.740]   podcast.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.780]   That means they've probably subscribed to your show.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.540]   They have information available to them in your episode title.
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:44.400]   And so they have opportunities right there for them to grasp what it's about.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.900]   And then you can bring them in as quickly as possible, bring them right into the story.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.260]   And in that case, much of the time, intro, music, et cetera, I think it hurts.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.260]   Where it doesn't hurt is if your show, if you do just a minute to tell people what the
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.780]   show is about, a sentence, a couple sentences.
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.060]   I've struggled with this over time to figure out what my show is about.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:08.660]   And I'm probably 65% happy with my current intro.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.840]   My current intro is, "Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.300]   with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:20.760]   now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less."
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.260]   Still a little bit wordy, but honesty is really important to me.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.460]   And I want to make sure that people know my show is about a rich and meaningful life now
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.840]   and financial freedom.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:36.780]   So I could shorten it up, and maybe I should, but you want to have that clear communication.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:41.140]   And so if you can craft a very clear statement that tells what your show is about and what
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.980]   your unique selling proposition is, what's different, then that should be what you should
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.980]   lead with.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.980]   But it should be short.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.340]   It's fine if it's a voiceover, but make it short.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:56.080]   If you have qualifications in your area of expertise, I think it's best if we start to
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.380]   figure out how to bring those qualifications in.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.740]   This one is new for me.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:09.340]   Share with you a story that has brought this deeply to my attention.
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:14.860]   Someone in my personal circle of influence recently got involved with a lady that was
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.060]   in significant need.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.960]   And my friend became aware of her situation.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.360]   She was sleeping on the streets.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.820]   She had been evicted from her apartment, was in a really tough space.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:31.460]   And this lady was in her, I would say, late 60s, mid to late 60s, in a very difficult
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.880]   situation.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.460]   And so my friend wanted to help her, and he didn't have, however, much capacity to be
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.780]   able to offer her.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:43.180]   He didn't have any extra bedrooms, didn't have any extra space in his house, literally.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:48.900]   And so the best that he could offer to her was to allow her to sleep on his back porch,
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.700]   a small screened-in back porch.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.020]   And this was of help for her.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:57.620]   It was the best he had, but it was of help for her because it allowed her to enjoy a
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.160]   little bit of physical safety.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.420]   She was unsafe on the streets.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:10.820]   She had been accosted, and there was potential for her to be physically accosted by other
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.220]   homeless people that were around.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.100]   She was concerned for her safety.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:18.740]   And so this was a great blessing to her to be able to be off of the physical street,
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:23.060]   even though she was simply sleeping on a back porch, a small screened-in back porch.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.940]   That was a blessing to her.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:30.360]   She was able to make that small screened-in back porch a little bit more homey by setting
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.900]   up a bed, hanging some curtains, et cetera, furnishing it with some furnishings she found
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.160]   on the side of the street.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.340]   And I interacted with her in a few different ways through this process.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:44.260]   And along the way, in inquiring into her situation, I found out that she is a podcaster and that
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:48.820]   she hosts a podcast on how to be successful in life.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.260]   Now hear me clearly.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.700]   I want to honor each and every person's individual story.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:02.100]   I like the saying, although I don't remember who to attribute it to, that every man I meet
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.500]   is in some way my master.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:09.940]   Every person with whom I interact has experiences that I can learn from and that I can gain
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.020]   from.
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   And for me, I try to find those experiences.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.340]   It's valuable to seek those out.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:25.220]   And I want to be very slow to denigrate or somehow try to cut down anybody who is seeking
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:32.660]   to work hard and to live honestly and uprightly and to improve their circumstances.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:38.460]   I also believe that it's possible for people who are not experts in a subject to help other
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:43.860]   people as long as they're being honest about their lack of expertise.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:48.700]   I could learn my way through, I could create media as I learn my way through a subject
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.740]   and create that in a useful way.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:57.460]   But I would be very careful to disavow any claims of expertise in that situation.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:03.860]   I became aware that this lady was podcasting on success and she has a regular show on blog
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.180]   talk radio about how to be successful.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:13.340]   And I want to be, hear me, I don't want to cut her down, but I also want to be honest
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:22.580]   that she was homeless, literally living on the street, financially destitute, has very
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:29.260]   poor relationships with anybody in her family, is estranged from her husband, is estranged
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:33.700]   from some of her children, and relationships are so difficult to the point that even though
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:40.660]   the children know that their mom is living on the street, that they wouldn't support
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.140]   her, wouldn't take her in.
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:49.660]   Wasn't able to find a job for a very long time and that's enough.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:57.540]   So the point is that she's podcasting on success and trying to teach people how to be successful.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:05.980]   I found that difficult to take because what was the basis of her qualifications?
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.940]   Believe qualifications matter.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:10.020]   They're not mandatory.
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.980]   We can learn from people who are failures, we can learn from people who are learning,
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.020]   but at the end of the day qualifications do matter.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:21.620]   If you have qualifications, I think it's best if you can figure out how to share those
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:29.380]   qualifications in a useful way that people will know what your expertise is.
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.780]   Because the marketplace is getting crowded.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:37.540]   If you're creating a success podcast and you are up against in competition with my
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:45.020]   friend who is homeless and also creating a success podcast, then you need to figure out
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.500]   how to set yourself apart.
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:52.740]   Carefully consider the time that you put into a podcast.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:59.420]   There's a balance of too much versus too little and I have fought and struggled with this
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.900]   balance.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.900]   You are always capable of better.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:11.620]   No matter how good your podcast is, you can always create something that is better.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.780]   But should you?
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.500]   On the other hand, if you have something that's not very good, should you really take it to
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.580]   the market?
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:27.180]   For me, this has been a real balance in terms of the quality of my own presentation.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:31.220]   And I've tried a variety of approaches.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:38.620]   I have found that I can create a phenomenal show if I sit down and I carefully script
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.620]   and plan everything I'm going to say.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:46.700]   I plan every analogy, I plan every story, I plan every point, I number and outline everything
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.980]   very, very carefully.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.180]   I can do that.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.060]   But it takes a tremendous amount of time to do that effectively.
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:53:02.820]   If I do that, I'll be able to stay very carefully on track with my entire presentation.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.500]   I won't ramble.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.660]   I won't follow rabbit trails.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.100]   I'll be on target.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.500]   And that's really good.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.940]   It creates a good result.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:16.180]   Now I can take that show and I can make it even better by sitting down in the editing
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:24.460]   studio and carefully cutting, scrapping much of my ideas and just keeping the most powerful
[00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:25.460]   points.
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:31.540]   I could make it even better if I used one draft and then went and did a second recording
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:36.300]   and a second editing and maybe voiced over some parts that weren't so good and removed
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.540]   something that wasn't perfect.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:47.100]   And I can make an absolute masterpiece of a show, which I then publish to the internet
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.460]   and 50 people listen to.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.860]   That's probably not a good use of time.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:54:00.140]   And you need to be aware of the fact that when you're taking your time to publish something
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:06.100]   to the internet for free for people to listen to, you should be careful about investing
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:11.900]   too much time and energy into that work.
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.060]   On the flip side, you can do too little.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.540]   You can have a thought and you can sit down and you can wander in your presentation, not
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.660]   know where you're going, not know what you want to talk about.
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.100]   And you hear this frequently in the world of podcasting.
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.620]   So Joe, what do you want to talk about today?
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.240]   Well, I'm not sure, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.560]   And you essentially waste time.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.840]   And your show is never good enough for the audience to actually grow to make it worth
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.260]   your while to do more work.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:40.100]   I don't know how to advise you on the right solution.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.900]   I do advise you to pay attention to it.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:48.860]   And what I have had to learn and to be comfortable with is the fact that every individual podcast
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:57.100]   episode is not the best that I could do with unlimited time and resources, but it is the
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:04.620]   best that I can do with the time and the resources that I'm able to devote to my work.
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:11.780]   None of my listeners can expect me to sit down and pour 50 hours into creating a beautiful
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:17.900]   25 or 30 minute show that I present to them for free with no good advertising model, with
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.700]   no good platform behind it.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.140]   There are some people who have the platform to be able to do that.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:29.980]   If I worked with one of the NPR or NPR outbranched podcasts and you had a staff of three to five
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:35.660]   to six people that are all had years of broadcast experience, we could pour 70 hour weeks, all
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:39.380]   of us into creating this 30 minute masterpiece and it would be huge.
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.700]   And there's a place for that.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:45.140]   If you have those resources, you should seriously consider devoting those resources to it because
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.740]   the shows are wonderful.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:54.660]   But that may not be your show and that may not be worth it for you.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:56:01.740]   My record of preparation was about 16 or 18 hours, about 16 or 18 hours that I did on
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:06.020]   preparing for one podcast episode at one time.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:12.020]   That show was very low listenership, was not particularly well embraced and made not much
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:17.080]   of a dent or a splash.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:29.420]   One of my most popular shows in the last year I did zero preparation for.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.960]   I had no prepared, let me adjust that.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.600]   It would be unfair to say zero preparation.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.240]   I have years of preparation of work and I've worked hard to get better as a broadcaster.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.480]   I did no specific outline or plan.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:45.480]   I just sat down with a general concept in my head and I hit record and I went.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:49.640]   That was one of the most popular episodes of any of my shows for the last year.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:55.120]   To the extent that a podcast can go viral, it went viral.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.440]   So what do you do?
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:02.520]   Consider carefully your input and do what you can do.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:07.320]   You want to create something that's good but don't fall prey to the trap of thinking that
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.640]   you're going to create the best that you possibly can.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.680]   You can't.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.080]   You can do what you can do.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.560]   Podcasting can be very humbling.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:23.360]   It can be very, very humbling.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:27.600]   Even in what I just said, almost every single episode that I produce, I know I could do
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.720]   better.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.560]   This episode right now, I'm racked with, I'm looking at the time and I'm saying, "Okay,
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:39.360]   it's 57 minutes into the show and I'm not even probably a third of the way into my outline
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.360]   and what am I going to do?
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.560]   Am I going to create a three-hour monstrosity?"
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:50.440]   And my brain, as I'm recording, is filled with doubt and question about, "Am I doing
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.440]   the right thing?
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.760]   Should I hit stop, scrap the last 57 minutes, rework my outline?
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.520]   Should I turn this into a three-part series?
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.400]   I don't know the right solutions but I'm live on the microphone and I got to figure out
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.560]   what to do."
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.160]   That's the scenario.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.520]   As I'm listening to myself, I'm editing and I'm hearing the sentence that, "Oh, that was
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:12.520]   an unnecessary sentence," or, "That was an unnecessary pause that you've used a filler
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.400]   word because you weren't sure the next thing to say."
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.640]   I hear all those things.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.680]   And yet I know that at the end of this episode, I'm going to hit stop and then I'm going to
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.060]   hit publish.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.640]   And that's very humbling because I know I could do better with more time.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.600]   But you can't afford to.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.160]   It's a podcast.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.820]   It's not a speech to the United Nations.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.320]   It's a podcast.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:43.240]   Now the other impact and reason why podcasting is humbling is that you can't edit your ideas
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:50.160]   and present them in the smoothest, most polished way possible as you can with written text.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:57.600]   You can't present an idea that's going to be presented as smoothly as you would love,
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.680]   as effectively with a podcast as you can with a written essay.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:07.840]   A written essay has the ability for you to sit there, consider your ideas, polish them,
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:13.560]   and then publish your final considered project to the world.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.500]   Podcast is much more extemporaneous.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:19.680]   You may have an idea of what you want to say, but then you're not so sure how it can be
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.120]   received and you better be ready to be humbled because all of a sudden your words will come
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:27.000]   back against you.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.800]   You may express things clumsily and then there's that sense of regret, but you can't go back
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.800]   and undo it.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.840]   And then you're faced with the question of, was that bad enough that I should go back
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.480]   and edit what I said and rework the whole thing and scrap it?
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:44.160]   Well, maybe some people can do that, but I think in general, you and I shouldn't do that.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.320]   Let me give you one example of how hard this was for me.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:53.880]   I have a mental list of a handful of times on Radical Personal Finance where I've said
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.920]   something that I legitimately regretted.
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:04.560]   And if it was serious, if I felt like I could apologize in good faith for something, then
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.640]   there have been a couple of times where I've apologized, whether I got something wrong,
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.080]   I shared erroneous information, or I just said something that was out of character.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.680]   Sometimes my emotions get the best of me.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.160]   I become very enthusiastic about a subject and my mouth outruns my brain.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.960]   But one example of this that was hard, or just as a practical example of what I'm saying
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.120]   about how humbling it is, one time, and I forget what show it was, I was talking about
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.160]   Dr. Martin Luther King and I was talking about character.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:39.880]   And I talked about Dr. Martin Luther King and I had recently read an accounting of his
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.880]   life.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.720]   I was reading a biographical essay of his life.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:51.320]   And in that context, one of the things that I learned that I had not previously known
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.080]   was about his personal moral failings.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:04.360]   The man was an adulterer, extensively without any sense of sorrow or humility.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:09.760]   And that for me was very disappointing because I really honor, personally, I really honored
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:17.200]   and respect Dr. Martin Luther King and his work that he did of seeking to preach righteousness
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:23.180]   and justice to a nation infused with unrighteousness and injustice.
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.400]   He stood in the face of tremendous attack.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:33.360]   Some of his written content and his speeches to this day need to be studied and considered
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.880]   because they're incredibly powerful.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:41.400]   You know, you go and you read his essay letter from a Birmingham jail and it's a powerful,
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.600]   powerful thing.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.960]   And so I have this great respect and admiration for Dr. Martin Luther King and I believe he's
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.120]   a man who's worthy of study.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:57.860]   But I had not previously been aware of the extent of his personal moral depravity.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.600]   And I had just learned about this and I was disappointed.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.840]   I was legitimately just disappointed in learning something about somebody that I honored and
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:13.460]   then having to reconcile with the fact that he was a flawed man.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:18.440]   But in the context of the show, I said it without all of those positive things about
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.520]   him.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.560]   And I said it without saying anything positive about him.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:29.520]   I just said Dr. Martin Luther King was a morally depraved man and that really – and I was
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.280]   just saying it was hurtful to me and I learned this and how disappointing.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.840]   But I wasn't able to wrap it with that polite context in which it came across in the way
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.400]   that I conveyed it.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:48.760]   It came across in a way that was at the very least insensitive and perhaps clumsy with
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:56.680]   a kind expression, all the way to the point where an uncharitable hearing would – someone
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:03.040]   would accuse me of falling – of aligning with the various people who sought to destroy
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:10.800]   Dr. Martin Luther King because of their racism and their inherent desire to destroy him.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.960]   I couldn't take it back.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.280]   I can't remember if I apologized for that one or not.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.680]   I felt like it's not my job to apologize for somebody else's uncharitable hearing
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.760]   of the words that I said.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.920]   I have to trust that my heart is evident.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.360]   I can't remember if I apologized for that one or not, but it was very humbling because
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:35.800]   I – in the clumsiness of words spoken extemporaneously, I wasn't able to communicate as precisely
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.280]   as I would have liked, as inoffensively as I would have liked.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.400]   And that is very painful when you bring shame to a subject or an idea that you think is
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:51.320]   important and yet you express it clumsily and then that causes your message to be hurt.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.360]   It's humbling.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   Guess what?
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:00.360]   Podcasting can be very humbling because you can't create that perfectly crafted written
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.200]   essay as effectively as you can.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:09.240]   I have become much more charitable in my analysis of recorded comments or recorded remarks of
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.600]   popular personalities, people in the public eye, where it's recorded that so-and-so
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.320]   said such-and-such and it's this scandalous statement.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.520]   I personally have become much more charitable to say, "Well, wait a moment.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.400]   Let's view the context of that statement.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.760]   What were they saying before that?
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.000]   What were the afterwards?
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.200]   If at all possible, rather than just reading the written words, let me go ahead and bring
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.540]   in some additional context.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.960]   Can I see them say it?
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.360]   Can I try to listen for the inflection in their voice?
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.140]   And how does this fit in line with their other comments?"
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.680]   My hope is that a charitable listener would have heard my comments about Dr. Martin Luther
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:52.160]   King and somehow at least sense the heart of my disappointment in finding out the level
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:58.400]   of moral depravity in one of my heroes, not immediately jump to saying, "Well, Joshua
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:04.120]   is this terrible person who is a racist through and through, etc., blah, blah, blah."
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.320]   So it's very humbling.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.480]   Get used to it if you're going to compete in the world of ideas.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:19.000]   Next, the method and means of your production of your podcast doesn't matter.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.720]   You should pursue whatever production methodology is going to get production out of the way
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.100]   so that creativity can follow.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.760]   You have to learn what a microphone is, and it's good to learn the difference between
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:38.680]   a dynamic microphone and a, what do they call the other one?
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.680]   Condenser microphone.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.480]   You need to learn the difference between a dynamic microphone and a condenser microphone.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.000]   Hint, you want a dynamic microphone that lowers less room noise.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   Done.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   That's all you need to know.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.560]   You need to figure out how to plug it in and turn it on and somehow capture a recording.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.840]   But beyond that, none of the rest of the stuff matters.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.400]   And it all gets in the way when people are messing around with stupid programs.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:05.600]   Last year I spoke at a podcasting conference in Orlando called Podfest.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   I was there as an expert in Podfest.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.440]   And one of the things that was so fascinating, I wasn't a featured speaker, I was there
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.120]   as a supporting expert.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.920]   And it was fascinating to me because we did this exercise where we had a room of people
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.280]   who had never podcasted.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.240]   And we divided everyone into six or eight teams, each team being led by somebody like
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.000]   me who was an experienced podcaster.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.200]   And then we said, create a podcast, create a three-minute podcast on something using
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.200]   the equipment that you have.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   Now some of us had, one person had a microphone going into their iPhone, somebody had a computer,
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.000]   somebody had a voice recorder.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.280]   But what was fascinating to me was none of us, none of it cared about the podcast.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.880]   I recorded mine with a phone and I wanted to teach my group that it doesn't matter,
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.520]   all this stuff about gear doesn't matter.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.160]   So we used my iPhone without any external microphone, which I have plenty of external
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.640]   microphones I could have plugged into it, didn't even use that.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.920]   Just held the microphone in front of their face and we recorded right into the voice
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.800]   memo app on the microphone.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:18.640]   And then I did use an editing program, which I use from time to time on the phone that
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:25.240]   I use called Multitrack DAW, if you'd like to know, D-A-W is Digital Audio Workstation
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.240]   or something like that.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.920]   It's a frequently used acronym in the audio editing space.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.400]   So I use this program called Multitrack DAW.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.400]   So I edited the clips together real quick.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.680]   But at the end, I expected, frankly, that I said, well, ours is going to be pretty good
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.480]   as I had this idea of a podcast.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.360]   And I figured maybe there would be another one or two good ones and then three, four,
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.840]   five, not very good presentations.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.880]   It was a competition.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.480]   What we found was the exact opposite.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:57.000]   Every single one of the six or eight recorded podcasts that had been created with groups
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.360]   of eight to 10 people in 30 minutes or less of work was unique and creative.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.520]   And every one of them was good.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.280]   I was blown away.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.840]   Every one of them was good and every one of them was creative in its own way.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.520]   Some people followed traditional formats.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.400]   Some people had other formats that they pursued.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:23.880]   My group, we tried to create this NPR style podcast and they were all really good, really,
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.920]   really good.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.520]   And what we learned, what I learned and what all the other experts learned is when you
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:32.800]   get the gear out of the way, then you can have creativity with the message and with
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.800]   the content.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.480]   And that's what matters.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.880]   Next point, rankings don't really matter.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.680]   Sometimes your show will rank, sometimes it won't.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.960]   Rankings do not really matter.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.360]   They matter for you if they give you a little bit of pride.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.720]   But if you don't get rankings, it doesn't matter.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.320]   I haven't checked my iTunes rankings in six months.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.760]   It doesn't matter.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:10.360]   Number one, whether or not you rank on iTunes shouldn't be your indicator of success.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.120]   It might matter if you've invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into this new giant
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.880]   company, blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.720]   But you can't control how you rank compared to other people.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.320]   And that's the thing that angers me when people compare things on rankings.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.880]   Rankings involve other people.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.720]   All you can do is do the best that you can do.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.800]   And you compare yourself to other people who may have more resources than you, who may
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.880]   have more skill than you, who may have more experience than you.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.180]   You get a flawed sense of your own ability.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:50.200]   If I were to compare myself as a broadcaster against Alex Bloomberg of Gimlet Media, I
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.400]   would be angry at myself all the time.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:01.640]   It would be a totally unfair consideration though, because Alex Bloomberg has a tremendous
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.800]   career history that he has learned.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.840]   He's worked in the world of public radio and of spoken word.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.280]   He worked on This American Life, widely known as one of the best storytelling presentations
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.280]   ever.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.800]   He's worked under the masters for years.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.840]   He had a decades-long head start on me.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.120]   And so if I – and in terms of building his company, he built a tremendous podcast company
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.000]   with millions of dollars of venture capital.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.680]   If I were to try to compare myself to him, I would be miserable and I would quit.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:36.080]   And that's what happens when people compare themselves on rankings.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.160]   Don't compare yourself on rankings.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.320]   Compare yourself based upon what you're able to do.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.840]   And take pride in what you're able to do and the progress that you've made.
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.660]   I am deeply proud of my growth as a broadcaster.
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:56.240]   Very proud of it, because I've worked really hard to get better.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.300]   That doesn't mean that I don't see the flaws, but it does mean that I'm not going
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.360]   to compare myself to Alex Bloomberg.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.840]   I'm going to compare myself to my past, and I'm going to be happy with my progress,
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.000]   not my perfection.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.320]   The other reason rankings don't matter is that they're incredibly fickle.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.680]   Rankings will change all the time.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.840]   And when I was a new broadcaster, a new podcaster, I would take some screenshots, and I thought,
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.800]   "Well, I should take these in case I ever need to make some kind of marketing thing."
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.460]   I've never used them.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.800]   But there have been times when I'm ranked higher than Dave Ramsey, when I'm ranked
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.120]   higher than other big brands.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.680]   Does that mean that I have a bigger show than Dave Ramsey?
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.360]   Nonsense.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.620]   Nonsense.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.080]   Rankings are a distraction.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.000]   You may need them for a time to give yourself a little bit of encouragement.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.800]   But if you do well, recognize this.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.360]   You're not always going to do well, because sometimes somebody else who has more experience
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.860]   or more money or a better concept or a better execution of an idea is going to come along
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.960]   and beat you.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.440]   Don't take too much stock in rankings.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:07.520]   And if you're not doing well in rankings, recognize that your content might not rank,
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.700]   but that doesn't mean it isn't important.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:16.440]   Some of the most important ideas will never be publicly popular, or at least they won't
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.600]   be publicly popular during your lifetime.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.400]   Still doesn't mean you shouldn't devote yourself to the promulgation of those ideas.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.320]   Let's talk about reviews.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.400]   The number of reviews on your show matters, but the content of those reviews or even the
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:36.720]   number of stars that people give you is much less relevant than almost any other other
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:37.720]   factor.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:41.120]   Don't worry too much about the reviews.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.680]   In my mind, most podcasts do and should be getting lots of five star reviews, and you
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:52.120]   should be getting a good number of one star reviews.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:57.680]   Now don't ignore either, but don't run from your one star reviews.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:03.800]   I love the fact that any individual listener of any show can make their voice known.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.720]   It's such a tremendous, powerful thing that anybody who hears my voice can, without any
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:15.520]   influence of me or without any control of me or any ability of me to stop them, can
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.960]   pull up iTunes and can put their rating on Joshua's show and advise someone else.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.160]   It even goes beyond that.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.400]   Any person who listens to my show can go on Twitter and talk about it, can go on Reddit
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.280]   can talk about it, can go on a personal finance forum and talk about it.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.580]   Anybody who listens to me can do that, and that's a powerful trend.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:41.160]   You should applaud that because in the arc of liberty over human history, it has not
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.960]   always been that way.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:53.040]   We live in an exciting time where no longer are the rich elite in charge of everything,
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.840]   but rather systematically common men and women can have their voice heard.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   That's powerful.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.200]   This is happening every single day.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.200]   Communications is one of the most visible places for it to happen, but there are many
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.320]   others as well.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.840]   This is an exciting time to be alive.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:14.840]   And so you've got to build a little bit of a thick skin to help you deal with it.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:23.320]   Don't worry about your one-star reviews, but do listen to them.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:29.080]   Listen to them and try to figure out what's the reason behind somebody saying something.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.760]   If I go through and I read my one-star reviews, there is a lot of criticism in my one-star
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:41.040]   reviews that is absolutely accurate, that I fully agree with, and that's useful because
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.640]   it gives you a chance to get better.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.280]   On the other hand, many times people will leave one-star reviews and it's their way
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:57.200]   of expressing themselves over something that I say and believe that they find to be objectionable.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.840]   And so they'll say, I've had people say, one of my reviews, I can't remember the exact
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.400]   text, but it basically said something like this.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.160]   Joshua goes really deep on financial subjects and he never talks about the same thing again
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.640]   and again.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:17.080]   Well, my original outline for my show was I'm going to go deep on subjects that warrant
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.640]   it, and my intent is never to repeat the same subject.
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:26.960]   That means there's an archive of 500 individual unique episodes.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.600]   But those will change over time.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:33.120]   And so I'm not going to change my show plan because somebody left their one-star review
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.520]   because that's not how they want it.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.840]   Well, they can go find a different show.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:40.640]   I'm not changing my plan unless I felt like I wanted to change my plan.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.160]   That's different than someone saying, Joshua gets off topic a lot.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.200]   Joshua getting off topic is inexcusable, and that's the type of review that needs to be
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.580]   paid attention to.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.360]   So don't worry too much about the content of the reviews.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.760]   Don't let it bring you down.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.420]   And recognize this, no one reads the reviews.
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.420]   No one sees it.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:04.360]   In today's world of podcasting, the only thing that matters is the number of reviews because
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.240]   that's an indication of the size of the show and how established it is.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:13.060]   Once you get past 20 reviews, almost nobody is going to be able to read your reviews.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.060]   Nobody can go through.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:18.040]   There's no currently, in the current technology, there's no real way for someone to go and
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.680]   look through all the reviews, and no one's going to do that.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.200]   Your listeners are going to just simply click and listen, and if they like it, great.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.840]   If they don't, they're going to move on.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.640]   Don't worry about it.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:32.640]   Which by the way, we talk about how to get reviews.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.520]   Reviews are not as important as they once were, but they were important.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.960]   I think it's a mistake for you to beg on your show for reviews.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:44.300]   I think out of 500 episodes, I've probably said it five, maybe, no, in the early years
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.300]   it was more.
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.860]   A couple dozen times.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:52.700]   It is important, and one of the way for you who are listening, who have not left your
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:56.700]   favorite podcast host's review, I would ask you to do that.
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.700]   Just do it right on your phone.
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:58.700]   It takes just a minute.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:02.340]   Pull out your phone and please leave my show a review.
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:08.340]   It's fine to ask every now and then, but don't spend all your show talking about needing
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:09.340]   reviews.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.780]   It's not as important as it once was.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.260]   Just create good stuff and people will naturally do it.
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:17.420]   The most effective way that I have found to solicit reviews from my audience is when I
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.420]   answer email.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:23.820]   When a listener writes to me and I respond to them, then I'll often put in a PS and say,
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.460]   "Please will you leave me a review?"
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.660]   That would be very helpful.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:27.660]   I want to build reviews.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:32.260]   I want to have thousands of reviews, but in terms of the value of your listener's time,
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:36.540]   it's not worth your wasting their time for a couple minutes just so you can build more
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:37.540]   reviews.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.580]   Figure out another way to do it.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:44.900]   Think carefully about the feedback that you get and recognize that some is actionable
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:47.080]   and some is not.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:51.380]   People will give you all kinds of feedback and you've got to build a little maturity
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.700]   to filter through it.
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:56.540]   Some things are actionable now.
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:18:01.900]   For example, you may have an annoying verbal tick, an annoying habit that you weren't aware
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:04.020]   of.
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:10.100]   When you see that in a review, consider it and change it.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:15.500]   But you also may be criticized for something that is harder to change.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.360]   For me, the example is rambling.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.500]   Huge number of my reviews say Joshua rambles.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:25.300]   Well, I acknowledge that, but acknowledgement of a problem doesn't mean you know how to
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.300]   solve it immediately.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.300]   It takes time.
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:31.940]   It's took me a couple of years to really work that out.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.560]   I'm sure I still have room to grow.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.840]   You've got to build that.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.660]   That's actionable, whereas those are actionable things.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.940]   But then you'll receive reviews where people just don't like you.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.820]   They don't think that you ... You don't believe the right thing.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.940]   You're too much of a whatever.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.780]   Ignore that stuff and move on.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:56.140]   Also, think carefully about who you're receiving feedback from.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.320]   This to me is very important.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:04.940]   We need to develop a whole new skill set in this year and going on about how to filter
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.180]   feedback.
[01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:10.220]   Who are we receiving feedback from?
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:16.100]   One of my biggest fears that comes along with the value of the democratization of information,
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.180]   so there's a compelling trend.
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:19.340]   Anybody can contribute something.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:24.820]   But the problem is many people don't seem to exhibit the ability to discern the quality
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.140]   of the information that they're receiving.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:33.060]   They don't seem to have the ability of critical thinking to ask questions.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:38.960]   I'm so glad that anybody can publish a blog article or a Facebook post on anything and
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.380]   have it read by millions of people.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:54.460]   That said, the editorial integrity of a random blog post published by your favorite writer,
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:59.380]   who sits at home and puts words into their computer and makes claims and allegations,
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:06.580]   is nowhere near the editorial integrity of a carefully researched extensive article in
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:10.580]   the New York Times or the Washington Post.
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:15.780]   We're facing crisis in our modern world where people who are unable to distinguish the two.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.700]   It doesn't mean that a blogger, an individual blogger, may not have incredible insight and
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:20.700]   inside connection.
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.220]   They need to be considered.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:28.260]   But also the editorial integrity of a Wall Street Journal article needs to be considered.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:33.500]   In the same way, you need to also consider who you're receiving feedback from.
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:39.640]   It's one thing if a fellow expert podcast host gives you suggested critique and criticism
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.820]   of your show.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:43.380]   You should pay careful attention to what they have to say.
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.620]   You may still ignore it, but you should pay careful attention.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:52.580]   It's another thing if an unknown person writes something hurtful about you on the internet
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:54.560]   or something that hurts you.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.220]   You gotta ignore that and press forward.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.540]   And we need to teach people to carefully consider the information that they're getting and where
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:02.540]   they're getting it from.
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:07.820]   I have my story about the broke homeless person living on my friend's back porch, creating
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.380]   a podcast telling people how to be successful.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:15.620]   Unfortunately, I see this working out more and more and it's very concerning to me that
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:21.060]   in the world of the internet where communication is veiled, people put as much stock into a
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:25.500]   comment they receive in a Facebook group or in a forum as they do with somebody who knows
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:30.740]   them and who cares about them and who knows their life coming alongside in a quiet conversation
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:34.860]   saying, "Would you consider these things?"
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:39.260]   I've watched, especially young people, I'm very concerned, I've watched a few young lives
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:44.300]   be really disrupted because the primary source of information and encouragement seems to
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.300]   come from the internet.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:56.580]   And on the internet, an insecure, let me think about what adjectives to use here, an insecure,
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:07.140]   immature 13-year-old who doesn't know how life works has the same voice as a successful,
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:11.700]   experienced, mature, upright 70-year-old.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.700]   They're both words on a screen.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:19.020]   But my goodness, we can't let the 13-year-olds, you can't let the 13-year-olds instruct your
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.260]   13-year-old.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.300]   That's insane.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.340]   That's like sending your child into the monkey pen and saying, "You need to go in and learn
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.340]   etiquette."
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.300]   Well, they're going to come out acting like a monkey.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.260]   And yet that's one of the challenges of the internet.
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:37.660]   Serve your audience first and always.
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:40.140]   Your loyalty has to be to your audience.
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:44.820]   In the world of podcasting, you can't produce a lot of podcasts and hide who you actually
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:45.820]   are.
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.340]   So make sure that your loyalty is genuine.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:52.860]   If you keep that first and foremost, that will come through and people will look for
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.220]   you and they'll listen to you because they trust you.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:01.700]   They may not agree with you and that shouldn't be your goal, to get agreement.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.860]   In many ways, you can't control that.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:09.260]   You may be wrong in something that you believe, but what you can do is seek to get a hearing.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:17.140]   That's going to come from your genuine devotion to service, to the service of your audience.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:24.900]   However, figuring out who your audience is can be really hard.
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:30.740]   And in a way, you're going to play this very weird game of self-selection because you're
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:34.120]   not going to know who your audience is, but you're going to create your audience based
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.820]   upon what you're actually talking about.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.900]   And people are going to automatically self-select themselves in and out, which means that you're
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:45.220]   going to wind up with the audience that you created, that you don't know who they are,
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.740]   that you created them.
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:53.140]   It's very, very weird and very challenging.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:59.140]   You create something for a purpose and then people find it.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:02.420]   And the thing that you create will turn certain people off and it will turn certain people
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.060]   on and you're going to have a hard time.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:09.060]   You're just going to have to go with your concept and you're not going to know for a
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.600]   long time if it works out.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:17.180]   It's much harder for you to figure out who your audience is and about the only way that
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:21.740]   you can solve this problem is to say, "What audience do I want to serve and how do I want
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:22.900]   to serve them?"
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.820]   And then do your best to create something that you think will be effective and then
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:32.680]   wait and see because it can be really hard to figure out who your audience actually is.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.380]   You will likely receive very little communication from your audience in the beginning, even
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:38.140]   telling you who they are.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.340]   And this is not because your audience is filled with people who don't like to communicate.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.900]   It's due to the problems of podcasting.
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.020]   When people listen to a podcast, they're generally engaged in another activity.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:52.580]   Frequently it's something like driving or exercise or doing the dishes.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:55.100]   They're not usually in front of a computer screen.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:25:00.260]   Most of the audio communication is consumed on a mobile device.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:04.660]   And usually, frequently, the person is actually not physically holding their mobile device.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:08.460]   Their hands are on the steering wheel and the mobile device is piping through the speakers
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:13.180]   or their hands are in the dish bucket and their mobile device is piping on the counter
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:17.580]   next to them or the mobile device is in their armband and they're running down the road
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:20.380]   or pump an iron at the gym.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:25.600]   So it's very hard for somebody in that situation to stop and to communicate with you.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:31.060]   And so communication from an audience in the world of podcasting is in many ways much smaller
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:35.860]   and less frequent than it is from other media.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:41.180]   On a blog article, somebody who's reading the blog article is frequently on a computer
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:45.380]   screen, although there is tremendous mobile device consumption.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:48.580]   And they're probably, because they're reading it, they're probably also capable of either
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.840]   writing a quick comment or writing you a quick email.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:58.740]   So there's going to be more communication from a reader than from an audience member.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.900]   Also, medium matters.
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:06.740]   If somebody's watching a video of yours on YouTube, then right there underneath the video
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:11.520]   is a comment section that they can play your video and they can comment while they're still
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.620]   playing your video without stopping the video, which means that there's going to be much
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:18.440]   more engagement with commenting.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.980]   Podcasting doesn't have that.
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:24.140]   When someone's listening to a podcast in a podcast application on their phone, they're
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:30.060]   not going to be also simultaneously posting a comment on your article.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.060]   They're not there.
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:34.020]   There's no commenting function in the podcasting application.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:38.420]   And so they'd have to go to a separate application, either the mail app or an internet app.
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:43.780]   They'd have to find that podcast, which may be very difficult, and let you know the feedback.
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:46.820]   And so it's just much less frequent that you're going to have communication.
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.340]   So don't sweat it.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:51.460]   Just recognize that's the nature of the game.
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:55.060]   Now on the flip side, when your show grows, you may have more communication than you can
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.060]   handle.
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.060]   This has been a real challenge for me.
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:27:00.820]   I can't handle the communication and it's caused significant stress to me.
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.180]   I'm happy to hear from my audience, but it's caused stress for me to learn new skills,
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:09.380]   to figure out how do I gain the positive things of really listening to the individual people
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:11.860]   that listen to me without letting it run my life.
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:13.900]   So just don't worry about it.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.640]   Just get used to it.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.620]   Also get used to the idea of developing some filters for your feedback.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:25.900]   For some reason, the anonymity, supposedly, of the internet causes people to lose their
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.260]   inhibitions.
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:30.340]   You see this every day and you experience this every day.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:38.500]   But as you create public content, you're going to experience a lot more of this.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:44.020]   People are just somehow, I don't know if, people somehow think that you're not a real
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:49.900]   person and they think that because your name is on a screen or because your name is attached
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:55.860]   to something that personal insults are now okay, that you're a public figure and they're
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.640]   now okay.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.700]   In a way, they are in the sense that when you put yourself out there, you got to deal
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.220]   with it.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:07.740]   But it takes a little bit of time to recognize that people think that you're fake.
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:11.100]   They would never sell you to your face some of the things that people write to you on
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.100]   the internet.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:18.300]   The funniest one, last week, somebody tweeted to me, and I'll read you the tweet.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.300]   Here was it.
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.580]   It was a man named Kevin Gates.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:25.140]   He tweets to me and he says, "I'm a former subscriber who just checked in to see if you
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:31.940]   had any commentary on Bitcoin, only to see you've gone full MRA, men's rights activist.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.540]   Glad you're no longer getting my $5.
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:39.660]   By the way, I always thought you looked like an inbred, an intelligent inbred, but an inbred
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:40.660]   nonetheless!"
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:45.660]   I burst out laughing.
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:51.100]   I have never in my life been called an inbred.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:52.620]   I don't know what an inbred looks like.
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:55.140]   I don't know what an inbred is.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:29:00.440]   I think it's usually reserved as an insult for Southern people who have a reputation
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.500]   if you live in the deep South and up in the mountains of marrying your cousin.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:11.900]   But I had no idea what an MRA was or men's right activism.
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:13.300]   All this stuff is over me.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:17.620]   I just had to laugh out loud.
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:20.980]   But if you think about that as an example, this was not private.
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:25.100]   This was not somebody privately writing me an email.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:29.660]   This was not somebody commenting anonymously.
[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:35.540]   This is somebody on the internet who calls me an inbred.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:39.940]   It was remarkable to—it was just a good example of this.
[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:42.940]   This happens again and again and again.
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:49.580]   One of the biggest challenges is that frequently when you—depending on your content.
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:52.980]   For me, ideas are important and the power of ideas are important.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:54.180]   I don't shy from those ideas.
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.140]   That's very important to me.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:02.380]   I'm sure I experience more of this than people who are more, I don't know, not so focused
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.020]   on ideas and more focused on entertainment.
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:09.780]   If I had a podcast about camping and how great camping was, I wouldn't expect such vitriolic
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.660]   ideas as what I do.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:15.540]   But still, even so, you're going to get weird random insults.
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.500]   It takes time to develop some thick skin.
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.900]   All I can tell you, I don't know how to tell you to do it other than to recognize that
[01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:26.540]   you don't know who is talking to you and you often don't know who is hurting.
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:33.380]   Many times the people who are the most violent in their rhetoric are the people who are either
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:40.580]   personally hurting, they're in a tough spot, or they're also very personally insecure.
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:47.580]   And I'm not, it sounds arrogant to even say it, but the thing that I have learned the
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:52.700]   most is frequently the people who object the loudest are the ones who are the most insecure.
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:54.100]   And I've been there.
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:58.460]   When I think back to some of my ideas and the things that I've vigorously fought people
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:04.260]   over, the expression of my fighting them, and by fighting I mean debate, my debating
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:07.420]   them the most vigorously was because I didn't have a good answer.
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:11.980]   And frequently what will happen is when somebody, when you have a powerful idea or a powerful
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:19.220]   ideology or a powerful platform and you present it carefully, someone may interact with you
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:23.340]   over the ideas for a time.
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:30.060]   But then when they can't answer your argument, they answer with an insult.
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:35.780]   They call you an inbred or they say you look like an inbred, whatever that look is.
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:40.660]   And so I think it's important to recognize that that may happen.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:44.140]   You don't want to be too arrogant and say, well, I'm getting lots of abuse because my
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:45.460]   ideas are so great.
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:49.100]   No, you might be getting abuse because your ideas are abhorrent, but only you are going
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:50.100]   to know that.
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:53.700]   And I will say this, it gets better with time.
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:56.740]   I don't know, I didn't expect this.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:00.500]   This was one when I started a podcast, maybe I was naive.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.540]   I didn't expect it.
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:07.700]   And I'm a very sensitive, emotionally sensitive person.
[01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.020]   I think I do a pretty good job of connecting with people's emotions, understanding where
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:12.020]   they are.
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.020]   And I'm a pretty nice guy.
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:17.260]   I've never been in a fight with anybody in my life, just as an expression of that.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:21.460]   But then I wound up on the internet and it was not only people fighting with me, it was
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.200]   people fighting about me.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.980]   And it was the weirdest thing ever.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:31.140]   And there have been times when my email was filled with angry people and my comments were
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:35.700]   filled with nasty people who came to my website to tell me how bad I was.
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:44.060]   There were times when it really hurt me and it really caused me emotional pain.
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:49.300]   But I think if you push past that, I'll tell you, as you push past that and recognize,
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:53.160]   number one, that can be valuable because you can stop and think, is this something I really
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.160]   believe in?
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:33:00.940]   Is this idea that somebody is a part of something I really believe in?
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:06.460]   It's the hardest when you recognize that somebody is turned off to your message because of your
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:09.980]   own incompetence, because you express something clumsily.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:13.520]   That's really painful because you bear the blame for that, or you bear at least some
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.860]   of the responsibility for that.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.460]   But then on the other hand, sometimes you look and say, no, that idea is something that's
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.540]   worth it.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:27.180]   And I never wish to have relationships severed, but if that's the idea that you walk away
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.740]   from, I'm okay with that.
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.900]   And in time, you can develop some thick skin.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:35.580]   And that's really helpful, is to develop thick skin.
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.580]   And it does come with time.
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:44.220]   Today, I laughed when the person said it because it's so stupid.
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:49.820]   Now, it's not to say that it's always easy, but recognize in time, you will develop some
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:50.820]   thick skin.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.060]   It's the internet.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.700]   And a lot of times, some of the people who are the most hurting or the people that you
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:34:01.740]   are impacting the most are often the ones who react the most violently.
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:08.460]   Now, in that light, however, one thing I recommend to you is you're going to have to learn some
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:12.500]   new skills to interact with the world.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.620]   And here's some examples of some new skills.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:19.700]   Number one, I think it's important that you learn and put things in place to learn how
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:20.860]   to shut things off.
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:25.300]   If you're a new podcaster, it may not happen right away.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:31.780]   It may not happen immediately, but you've got to learn how to get away.
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:35.660]   In the early years, in the early months, you're frequently going to be, "Oh, I'm going to
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:36.660]   check my statistic.
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:38.540]   Let me see who comments," et cetera.
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:42.680]   But this can be very unhealthy if you don't learn how to turn it off.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:49.180]   What I have learned to do is to completely segment my life and to not have any possibility
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:55.260]   or to try as much as possible to minimize any possibility of my online life invading
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.660]   my offline life.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:03.020]   So that involves things like removing your social media applications from my phone or
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.020]   your phone.
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:08.340]   That's what I have found to be very helpful is removing all social media from my phone
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:12.180]   because it's so tempting to sit there and say, "Oh, let's see what's going on on Twitter.
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:13.180]   Let's see what happens."
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.580]   Or, "Hey, guess what?
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:19.460]   My little email just popped up and there was my Google alert for my name.
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:23.660]   And oh, they're arguing about me on Reddit or they're arguing about me in such and such
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:25.180]   a personal finance forum.
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:27.140]   Maybe I should go and look and see what they're saying."
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:30.740]   And then you go on there and see people ripping you apart one way and people defending you.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.660]   And it's like, "Wait a second.
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:37.300]   I'm hanging out here at the park with my children and now all of a sudden, instead of me pushing
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:40.260]   my kids on the swing, I'm now dealing with somebody on the internet who doesn't know
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.900]   me, who's upset about something I said?"
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:48.020]   And it's like, get a lot – and who thinks that their job is to talk about how I should
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:52.940]   quit what I'm doing when I give them a free podcast to listen to that may or may not help
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:56.340]   them and all they have to do is just click delete and move on with their life.
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:00.020]   It's so weird, but you've got to learn how to do that.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:04.540]   And thankfully, I have a couple of friends that I have also learned that with who have
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.340]   learned to do the same thing.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:10.700]   And if you're in the world of a public personality in any way, I think you need to learn new
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.140]   skills.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.380]   And so I've learned new skills.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:20.300]   Just simply, number one, get rid of any ability for anybody related to your stuff to find
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:23.580]   you when you're not in that mode.
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:28.580]   Meaning no social media – for me, it's been no social media, no email.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.900]   I'm only going to go and deal with that stuff when I can.
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:36.340]   And I don't want it to find me and invade my life and wreck my weekend.
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:42.860]   As a friend of mine said, a friend of mine who was a writer, a well-known, popular, nationally
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:47.980]   prominent writer, and he said he was with his wife and his mother-in-law one weekend
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:53.780]   in Washington, D.C. and they were out beautiful afternoon, Mother's Day, I think, watching
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:58.220]   the cherry blossoms and his wife had walked away and he glanced at his phone and all of
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:02.900]   a sudden saw some crazy email from somebody who was mad and triggered over something he
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.900]   said and it wrecked his whole day.
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:10.140]   And I spoke to him recently and we were talking about this and it just really hit me in the
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:11.620]   same – I've learned the same way.
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:14.460]   And it can happen right when you don't expect it.
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:19.020]   And what happens is for me, I immediately – when somebody says something, I immediately
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:22.860]   start thinking about it and I immediately start arguing with them in my head and I say,
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:23.860]   "Well, here is my argument.
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.860]   I sketch out my argument.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.980]   Here are the five main points, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.900]   and then they'll say this and then here's my rebuttal."
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:34.740]   And all of a sudden, I'm 45 minutes into this thought process and I was allowing myself
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:38.020]   to be controlled by some random person that doesn't care about me.
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:42.020]   Well, I ignore the people who are nearby.
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:44.420]   So you're going to have to develop new skills.
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:49.500]   I don't know exactly all the right way to handle it but think carefully about your situation.
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:56.260]   Make sure that you focus on the people that actually know you and that actually love you.
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.260]   Focus on those things first.
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:04.620]   In that light, if you have not yet started publishing anything online, I think you should
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:10.060]   seriously consider using a pen name or a pseudonym for your internet work.
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:16.900]   In hindsight, if you were going to ask me, my number one regret is using my name associated
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:18.980]   with radical personal finance.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:25.460]   My number one regret at this point is using my name because it's very painful when your
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:34.900]   worlds interact and it's very annoying when all of a sudden you lose your personal privacy.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:40.340]   Number one, it can cause you to diminish your ideas to a point.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:44.500]   So in real life, working with an individual, I don't mind sharing my ideas.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:48.820]   But when all of a sudden my name has to be associated with something in the world of
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:55.620]   the internet where an idea is going to be dealt with in whatever bazillion ways, then
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:58.940]   that's a little bit harder to deal with, especially when you see things done unfairly.
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.540]   Now if you're confident in your ideas, that's fine.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:05.860]   But there are other expressions of it because the people that get hurt are often not just
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.580]   you, but people around you.
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:12.260]   And that can be very hard.
[01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:16.660]   In hindsight, if I were going to go back and do it over again, I would never associate
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:20.500]   my name with my online work.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:23.660]   Now when I did it, I did it because I said, "Well, I'm a certified financial planner
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.180]   and I really stuff and of course I want people to know that I'm real and legitimate."
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.180]   Well, bad decision.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:33.220]   If I were going to go and do it over again, I would never use – I would always use a
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:34.220]   pseudonym.
[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.260]   I would always use a pen name.
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:40.140]   And there have been times where I have seriously considered shattering the whole thing, scrapping
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:47.780]   the whole brand so I could get away from the invasiveness of your life being all out there
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:50.460]   and everyone being able to find you.
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:55.460]   That's really tough, really tough to deal with, especially when it exposes people.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:40:01.060]   And I've got thick enough skin to deal with – I can deal with or I can learn to develop
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:05.820]   thick enough skin to deal with the stuff that you got to deal with when you have ideas that
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:07.500]   you believe are important.
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.540]   But I'm not putting my wife and children through that.
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:13.500]   And unfortunately, that's the challenge is that you got to figure out how to protect
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.060]   the people that are the most important to you.
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:20.420]   And the challenge here of course is that if you want to do something fully privately,
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.300]   it's really tough.
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:24.420]   And to not have your name tied to it at all, it's really tough.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:29.300]   So most people, you could pretty quickly pierce the veil of so-called anonymity with a little
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.300]   bit of work.
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:31.420]   I'm good enough on the internet.
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.620]   I could pierce most people's veils.
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:37.980]   But anyway, consider just using a pseudonym or a pen name.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:40.940]   People have asked me about how I actually produce the show quite a bit.
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:45.620]   So I'll just make it very, very simple and walk you through what I actually – the gear
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:48.700]   that I use and what I actually do now.
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:51.620]   Recognize that this is built and grown over time.
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:53.860]   I record in my home office.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:58.420]   My home office is just a third bedroom in my house.
[01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:03.300]   And in terms of the office, it's not particularly a great podcasting studio.
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:06.500]   My personal podcasting studio is not a soundproof room.
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:10.580]   Frequently, unfortunately, though I've done my best, you'll hear one of my young children
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:11.860]   crying in the background.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.140]   I've tried to screen that out.
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:21.100]   What I did is there's a very non-sound dense wall between me and my family and I hung up
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:26.460]   some sound blankets on the wall to try to give a little bit more sound isolation for
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:27.460]   my young children.
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:33.460]   It's just pretty hard for me to stomach paying money for an out-of-the-house office when
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:38.580]   I'm paying a lot of money just to never have my children or my dogs interact with my audio.
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:41.620]   So I hung up a bunch of sound blankets on the wall.
[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:42.740]   Sound blankets do a pretty good job.
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:46.900]   I have a triple layer of them and that blocks out enough of the noise that I am happy with
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:47.900]   it.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.740]   Beyond that, my office has no particular sound treatment.
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:53.180]   I record using a dynamic microphone.
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:57.940]   A dynamic microphone is one that is not so sensitive to all of the room noise.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:05.900]   I use a microphone that is called a Heil PR40, which is one of the popular podcasting microphones.
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:08.700]   Totally unnecessary if I were going to do it again, knowing what I now know, I wouldn't
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:09.700]   bother.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:10.780]   I don't think it matters that much.
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:18.220]   I would use an Audio Technica ATR2100, which is a $70 microphone instead of a $350 microphone.
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:21.540]   It would be every bit as much as I ever care about.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.440]   But I do use a Heil PR40.
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.040]   When I originally started, I just had it on a cheap stand and then over time, as I felt
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.500]   it was worth it, I went ahead and I bought the expensive shock mount.
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:34.040]   So in early episodes, there would be shocks to the microphone sometimes.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:35.560]   There are fewer of those now.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:41.500]   Now I can move the microphone and I can tap it and it won't convey the sound through.
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.100]   So I use the Heil shock mount.
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:48.020]   And I also do finally now use a Heil boom arm, which is very helpful because having
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:53.300]   your microphone on a good boom allows you to sit back and to speak much more comfortably
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:57.500]   versus hunching over a microphone for years, how I had it sitting on a desk.
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.220]   I record through a mixer.
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:05.180]   I use a Mackie mixer, which I have a 14 channel mixer because that was cheap.
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:06.580]   I bought the used one and I got it cheap.
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.020]   I don't need that at all.
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:13.260]   But the mixer is set up onto and that allows me to do things live.
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:19.140]   So if I'm going to go and play audio from the computer, if I'm going to play a video
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:24.580]   or something like that, then it allows me to do it live, which is valuable.
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:27.800]   When I originally set out to commit to my production schedule, I knew that I could never
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:32.340]   produce as much content as I wanted to if I was going to be doing editing after the
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.340]   fact.
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:39.680]   And so from the beginning, I focused on editing or producing live so I can do everything right
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:43.220]   at once, play voicemail, play sound clips, whatever.
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:45.860]   It all goes done and in one take.
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:52.980]   Coming also into that computer is I use, sorry, into the mixer is I have a channel for my
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:56.580]   computer and I use, what's this thing called?
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:02.200]   A sound blaster, a little USB adapter that adapts into my computer and that allows me
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:05.540]   to send my computer audio into my mixer.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:10.640]   It also allows me to do what the podcasting world calls a mix minus, which allows me to
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:19.620]   use an online application to record my high quality microphone into an audio recorder
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:25.220]   while also recording the audio coming back from somebody else's audio to do my online
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.300]   interviews.
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:32.100]   And I can do that using frequently used Skype, but at this point I'm moving away from Skype
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:37.060]   and doing other communications options with my guests.
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:40.920]   Of course, Skype is the most well known, so that works fine.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:41.920]   So that's effective.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:45.420]   I have an output from that which goes into an external audio recorder.
[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:52.720]   I use a Roland, I don't remember what this is called, but basically it's a Roland audio
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.040]   recorder which works fine.
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:59.720]   It records onto an SD card and that allows me to have a reliable, consistent recording
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.720]   of my show.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.520]   So when I'm done, I hit stop and then I stick it in the computer.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:09.760]   I used to do just a little bit of editing to trim the beginning and the end, and then
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.760]   even that was annoying to me and I couldn't do it.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:20.400]   So finally, I use an audio processing program called Auphonic which levels the audio out
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:26.880]   and it gives it a good, nice, consistent level, which for my type of content is the most important
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:27.880]   thing.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:30.760]   So I process my audio file with Auphonic and then I publish it.
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.000]   I upload it into my Libsyn account.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.480]   Libsyn is my audio host.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.680]   It uses a coupon code "radical" for, was it a first month free?
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.560]   Libsyn is my audio host that I use to host my files and then from Libsyn, everything
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:47.520]   gets distributed out to my website to the various feeds as well.
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:49.000]   So that's my tech setup.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000]   I've done different things.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.800]   I sometimes record into my phone.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:57.520]   I use Sean Smith's, the Mobile Pro setups when I've done mobile interviews.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:00.200]   I've done a few different things like that.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:05.600]   But at this point, all the tech stuff is my least interested, I'm completely disinterested
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.800]   in it.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:09.040]   That's not what makes the difference.
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:13.680]   Probably the biggest tip I could give you is what I do use extensively is an application
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:15.280]   called Workflowy.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:20.240]   And Workflowy is essentially an outlining program, but it's an outlining program with
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:27.760]   unlimited levels of outlining and unlimited movability, which it's hard for me to explain
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.240]   in audio form how important this is.
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:34.320]   But in practice, Workflowy is probably my most important tool.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.440]   It costs five bucks a month.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:40.160]   And of course, me being cheap, I've tried at times to say, "I'm going to do without
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.160]   it."
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:45.560]   But every time I come back to it, and I have about 900, almost a thousand pages of content
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.720]   in Workflowy over the years of all of my podcasts and all of the outlines that I have built.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.960]   Workflowy is for me probably one of my most important tools because it allows me to do
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:01.200]   a good job of sketching out my notes in advance of the show, which is really, really good.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.840]   So that's how I do it.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.960]   And wrap up, I've got eight more points.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:11.840]   An internet business is really wonderful, and it can change your view of the world substantially.
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.400]   It really can.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:18.400]   It's also work, just like anything else.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:26.160]   I always tried really hard to have an accurate understanding of the world.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.160]   And I'm not scared of work.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.840]   I don't think that work is something to be run from.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.240]   But you should know that just podcasting, if your dream is podcasting, recognize that
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:38.000]   everything you do in the world is going to be meaningful.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.060]   There's going to be parts of it that are great and parts of it that are not.
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:46.640]   But it is very valuable to be able to feel the contentment of impacting other people,
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.440]   impacting other lives, is really, really helpful.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:54.560]   And podcasting is wonderful from that.
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:59.840]   Having your income untethered from your geographic location is powerful.
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.920]   And I really like it.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:04.280]   It's very powerful.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:07.800]   Working from home is great.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:14.520]   Working from home has allowed me to achieve many of the goals that I have wanted to achieve.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.600]   And yet, working from home has many challenges.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.080]   I was naive when I started Radical Personal Finance.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.520]   And I thought everything about working from home would be great.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:27.720]   And there are many things that are much better about working from an office.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.680]   So just recognize that it's a give and take.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.280]   And it may take your family time.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:36.080]   It took my wife quite a while, a number of months, probably six months, to figure out
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.480]   for us how to figure out our working relationship when I was at home during the day, about when
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:48.400]   I'm at work versus when I'm not at work, and how those lines are blurred or present.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.160]   And so that took us a while to figure out some new skills to deal with that.
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.440]   Work is work no matter what.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:01.400]   And I think you should be aware of that, that podcasting is great work.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.520]   It's work, just like anything else.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:07.920]   One of my big concerns today that I didn't have a few years ago, and I wouldn't recommend
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.240]   this to you to worry about this today.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:14.520]   If you're a new podcaster, but I think that everybody who is creating something and publishing
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:18.820]   it needs to pay careful attention to this.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:23.360]   Number one, you've got to make sure that your connection with your audience is sufficient
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.560]   because your work is good enough that they're going to find you wherever you wind up on
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.560]   the internet.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:33.080]   One of the most devastating days of my business career was that after, right before my hundredth
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:36.880]   episode I deleted all my podcast listening audience.
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:39.340]   And I'd worked on it for months, six months.
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:40.340]   And I just deleted everything.
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:44.600]   And many of you have had your, just the show stopped updating and you had to go and find
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:47.320]   me again and figure out how to resubscribe.
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:52.480]   But this can happen today more easily than you might think.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:57.240]   And you've got to figure out in today's world how to own your own brand and how to own your
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.800]   own list.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:02.640]   One of the new dangers that we face today that we didn't face a number of years ago
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:07.000]   was being shuttered by the big corporations that own access.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.040]   I have tremendous concerns right now about what YouTube is doing.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:14.120]   I have thought about pursuing more video production and getting involved in the world of YouTube.
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:21.320]   I have ideas that I believe would be valuable there, but their actions of silencing voices
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:27.040]   that they don't want to have on their platform have been so, in my opinion, onerous and egregious
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.540]   that I don't much want to get involved with them.
[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:34.120]   But unfortunately it's hard not to be involved with them all at some point.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:41.000]   One of the biggest concerns that I have right now is the infringement on free speech and
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:46.360]   on people's ability to speak about the things that are valuable to them without being shut
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:51.400]   down by the content people that want to interact with them.
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:57.720]   So whether this is a hosting service, I had tremendous concerns when GoDaddy came out
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:03.960]   publicly and started to stop supporting the website registration and the domain service
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:11.240]   for people on their platform who they considered to be hate speech, the white supremacist and
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:14.120]   white nationalist movements a few months ago.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:17.960]   I had tremendous concerns when Google did the same thing.
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:22.120]   One of my biggest concerns is that many of the payment processors right now are systematically
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.480]   delisting people.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:29.920]   And this is significant in the world of Christian ministries right now where there are a number
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:36.920]   of Christian nonprofit organizations that are just systematically delisting people who
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.800]   want to use them as a donation service.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:42.800]   I've looked at some where they've been dropped by PayPal, they were dropped by Stripe, they
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:44.000]   were dropped by all this.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:50.600]   And it's very problematic when these companies own what you're doing and they decide, "Well,
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:53.720]   we don't like what you have to say and so we're going to drop you."
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.840]   This is a huge concern of mine.
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:52:00.320]   And so it's caused me to say, "Okay, well, how do I figure out how to own my own brand?"
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:03.520]   And I think that in the future, we'll more and more need to consider this.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:07.440]   But I'm not willing to deal with these people who have betrayed my trust and allow them
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.400]   to have access to my stuff and to have them be the ones who control access.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:15.400]   So that means we've got to go back and I've got to build more technical skills than I
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.160]   ever did before.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:21.600]   So I think that if you're an established podcaster or if you're somebody who has a message that
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:29.680]   is controversial for whatever reason, that you should pay a tremendous amount of attention
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:33.840]   to the current infringements on free speech.
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:34.960]   Things are good.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.440]   It's easier today to get a message out than it's been in the past.
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:42.080]   But just because things are good doesn't mean that there aren't substantial dangers.
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:46.320]   And just because there's a macro trend doesn't mean that you can't be steamrolled in your
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:47.320]   micro brand.
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:51.240]   It can be very devastating for your brand to be shut off.
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.840]   So think carefully about it and make sure that you own your list and make sure that
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:00.360]   you have a connection with your audience that will hopefully allow you to make it through
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:02.800]   those hard times.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:04.320]   Interviews.
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:08.640]   The biggest challenge that I have had with Radical Personal Finance in terms of content
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:11.920]   is trying to figure out how to do great interviews.
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:15.640]   And I'm happy with my progress, but it's not easy.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.960]   And I'll just tell you what I have learned.
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:21.200]   There are different approaches to interviews, approaches of people.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:24.000]   Some people say, "Here are all my questions in advance.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.500]   Here are all the questions that I want to ask you about.
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:31.140]   And here's everything that I want to talk about."
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.360]   Some people script an interview out in advance.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:34.580]   That seems to work sometimes.
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:38.200]   When I'm interviewed, I often like to get the questions so I can prepare some ideas
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:40.840]   about the subject.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:46.120]   But what I have also struggled with as an interviewer is trying to get someone to answer
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.320]   the questions the way that I want them to if I'm all prepared in advance.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:53.000]   What I've learned, some of the people that are the hardest for me to interview are people
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.520]   that I know their stuff, whether I've read their books or I've read their blogs.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:03.440]   And for me as an interviewer, my practice has frequently been to read everything that
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.400]   somebody's produced.
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.480]   And then I know all the things because I've consumed their 2,000 pages of content.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:12.720]   I know the 12 key ideas that I want them to get to.
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:16.480]   And so there have been many interviews where I've really struggled, where I bring somebody
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.160]   on and I say, "Here, this is the topic that I want to interview you on."
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:25.760]   And I wind up asking leading questions because I'm trying to drive them in a certain direction,
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:28.040]   but then they don't want to be driven.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:32.520]   That causes frustration because now I'm not really just asking them questions.
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:39.680]   I'm driving them in a certain direction, and yet they don't do it as well as I would like
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.880]   them to.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:44.440]   And so I've often found that instead of me interviewing somebody that I like their stuff,
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.600]   I should probably just do the summary.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.320]   Because if I've consumed their 2,000 pages and I know their 12 points that I think are
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:54.320]   the most powerful and the rest of it is all same old, same old, then I should just probably
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:59.080]   say, "Here are the 12 things that I most appreciate about Joe Smith and what Joe has to say."
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:01.200]   So I've struggled sometimes with interviewing authors.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.320]   I've struggled with interviewing people that I really know a lot about.
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:08.640]   I've also struggled with having things kind of prepared in advance.
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:15.040]   And what I have found to be the best practice for me is trying to embrace my curiosity and
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.860]   asking somebody certain questions.
[01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:22.080]   So for me, that's been effective, is that I'm curious enough and I have a wide enough
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.320]   background and enough subjects that I think what has been effective for me is just showing
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:31.400]   up and asking somebody an interesting person interesting questions.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.800]   Doesn't always work.
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:38.040]   And one of the things I had to learn how to do is in the early days, I basically would
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:39.640]   play every interview.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.000]   But now sometimes I get to an interview and I try to ask the person interesting questions
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]   and they're just not an interesting person.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.500]   And I look and look and look and I try to figure out, because my conviction that everybody's
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:52.320]   interesting in some way, and I just can't figure out how to get them to talk about anything
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.600]   interesting and sometimes I just scrap it and say, "I'm sorry, this isn't going to work
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:56.800]   out."
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:01.840]   But your allegiance is to your audience, not to your interviewee.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:04.500]   It's a privilege for them to be being interviewed on your show.
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:05.500]   You owe it to your audience.
[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:09.880]   And so I have many interviews that I've just scrapped that just simply because I said,
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:14.560]   "I'm sorry, but you didn't do a good enough job of presenting something that would be
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:16.320]   a value to my audience."
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.320]   Not arrogance, but I've got to serve my audience.
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:21.660]   I'm not going to waste their time with a boring interview.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:26.320]   So what I've learned is just to follow my interest and actually listen to the interviewer.
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:31.280]   Now one of the challenges, one of the things that I like as an interview listener is I
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:37.440]   like to hear the host that I like and that I enjoy interact with somebody on a topic
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:39.360]   from their point of view.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:45.400]   When I'm listening to a host, I want to hear them interview with their perspective.
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.880]   After all, Radical Personal Fineness is Joshua's show.
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:54.360]   And so in general, I assume that you want to hear Joshua's opinion on something.
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:56.300]   Otherwise why are you listening to Joshua's show?
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:01.120]   Many times someone who's been on a specific show is interviewed everywhere and you can
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:04.400]   go and pick whatever flavor of interviewer you want to find.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.560]   But if they're on Joshua's show, I figure they should interact with Joshua.
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:13.880]   This is a bit of a double-edged sword though, because in the modern journalistic culture,
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:20.840]   we're basically trained that an interviewer should just ask a question and shut up.
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.920]   And I actually personally, I don't like that.
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:27.840]   I think it's appropriate for a journalist to ask a question and shut up.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.600]   That's what a journalist should do.
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:33.920]   But an opinion commentator, I don't necessarily want them to ask a question and shut up.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:38.560]   I want them to ask a question, listen to the answer, and then engage on it and draw at
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.040]   that deeper level.
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:43.960]   But I frequently receive feedback from audience members that don't, or from listeners who've
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:46.920]   listened to an interview that don't like my approach to it.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:50.800]   They don't want to hear as much from Joshua on a subject as they do from the interviewee.
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:55.720]   That's kind of a delicate balance because I believe there is a rightness to that instinct.
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:59.200]   When I'm having somebody on my show, I'm having them to learn from them.
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:05.320]   But I also believe that I want to, if I were listening to the show, I'd want to hear the
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.080]   host interact with something.
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.860]   But interviews are really tough to do well.
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:14.480]   And so what I have learned is just to kind of follow my curiosity and to think.
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:19.280]   So today, these days, as far as how I do interviews, I try to understand a little bit about somebody.
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:26.220]   But I will usually show up with a pen and a notebook, and I'll just listen carefully
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:32.480]   to what they say and then try to interact with them on the subject.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:39.400]   And then I think of the questions usually while I'm doing the interview.
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:44.000]   Don't think it'll work for everybody, but that's what I have done so far.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.080]   Finally, embrace the vulnerability as a podcaster.
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:51.640]   It's hard, but you will learn more than anybody else.
[01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:57.040]   I am the one who's gained the most from Radical Personal Finance because I've learned a lot,
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:02.560]   I've been forced to articulate things that I couldn't articulate before, and I have grown
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:03.700]   a lot.
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:07.700]   And so I think as a podcaster, you're going to gain the most from your show.
[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:11.180]   So embrace that and embrace the fact that you're going to learn.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:14.900]   I do think it's important that you protect your family, and I think it's important that
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:20.020]   you put some safeguards in place to cut the outside world off to protect your family and
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.340]   protect the intimacy of that safe place.
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:25.020]   The internet is not a safe place.
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:30.180]   And two final comments is this.
[01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:34.020]   I want you to podcast.
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:35.940]   I want you to write.
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:41.940]   Because my hope is that podcasting can advance our public conversation in a useful way.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:48.180]   Podcasting has a unique benefit of not being 280 characters of sniping at one another.
[01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:52.820]   And unfortunately, in the US American culture, our culture is systematically we're tearing
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:55.500]   each other apart.
[01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:58.380]   And it's getting worse and worse.
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:02.380]   And very few people are listening.
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:06.700]   And unfortunately, I don't know of a way that that can be done other than through conversation.
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:11.460]   And the best format for that is usually podcasting, for people to interact with one another and
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:15.220]   to present ideas in a format that allows somebody to engage and to listen.
[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:18.100]   It's not going to happen on TV.
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:22.620]   TV is much more about the short soundbite and the opposing views tearing each other
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:24.620]   off and the fight.
[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:27.540]   It's not going to happen on YouTube because it's got to be about three minutes long of
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:29.900]   people sniping at one another.
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:31.780]   Can it happen in text?
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:32.780]   Some places.
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:38.340]   But podcasting is a really unique forum for us to have useful conversations about things
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:39.940]   that matter.
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:47.620]   And so my hope is that podcasting can advance our public conversation and our public dialogue
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:53.140]   in a really valuable way and allows people to listen to ideas in a non-threatening environment
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:56.580]   where they're not going to be if they go and want to listen to a political figure, they're
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:01:03.400]   not going to be pelted with paint or yelled at by some protester outside.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:09.380]   If they want to go and listen to some controversial opinion, they don't have to worry that it's
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:14.020]   going to show up in their Facebook likes.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.940]   So podcasting has the ability to do that.
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.860]   But in order for that to happen, we need more and more people producing useful, impactful
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:21.940]   content.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:27.820]   And so my hope is that podcasting can be one of the ways that we can build and resurrect
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:32.380]   to a degree, but I try not to look too much to the past, so that we can build an ability
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.780]   to have a conversation.
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:39.180]   I fear that it won't, but I hope that it can.
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:43.620]   And I want to invite you to join that conversation.
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:48.660]   It's going to require growth on your part and it will be hard, but I want to invite
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:51.540]   you to join that conversation.
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:53.600]   My final point is this.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:58.620]   If you've been podcasting and you're not experiencing success, don't be scared to
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:02.220]   scrap what you're doing and start over.
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:06.740]   Don't be scared to dump what you've done and rebrand.
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:11.500]   Because there is a point at which many people are really struggling and perhaps you've had
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:15.500]   a little bit of light in something I've said today and you realize, "Oh, here's the
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.500]   problem.
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.180]   Here's what's not going well."
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:21.500]   Don't be scared to dump it and start again.
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:25.500]   In today's world, especially in today's world of podcasting, you can go from zero
[02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:28.620]   to significant pretty quickly.
[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:32.840]   There's value to having an established brand, but if you're not experiencing the success
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:41.460]   that you have, just quit, retool, and start over.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:43.780]   Hope these thoughts and ideas have been useful to you.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:50.500]   I'm not turning Radical Personal Finance into the podcast advice hour, but as a fellow
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:56.580]   frontline innovator in this space, these are some lessons that I have learned from 500
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:03:00.180]   episodes of Radical Personal Finance.
[02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:05.820]   This show is part of the Radical Life Media network of podcasts and resources.

[02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:39.340]   See you next time.
