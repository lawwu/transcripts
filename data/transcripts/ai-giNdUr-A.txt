[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   Gabriel, a listener from the Philippines, asks a very common question and a much debated
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.800]   question.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.720]   Pastor John, when we die, does our consciousness continue somewhere or do we just sleep awaiting
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.280]   the second coming and the judgment?
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.440]   And why is sleep so often used to describe death, even by Jesus?
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.520]   And where in the Bible can I be more confident of what happens to me or to someone I love
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.980]   when they die?
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.560]   Should I imagine them sleeping, awaiting Christ's return?
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.800]   Or are they already in heaven or even in hell?
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.080]   Pastor John, what would you say to Gabriel?
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.020]   So I hear two questions.
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.720]   Why is sleep, the word sleep or the image of sleep, used to describe death, even by
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720]   Jesus?
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:59.280]   And number two, what is the experience of people between death and bodily resurrection?
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.440]   So maybe we should start by not taking for granted the biblical teaching that God's purpose
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:16.480]   is not just to have someday lots of spirits in heaven, but bodies on the new earth.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.740]   The resurrection of the body was a scandal to many Greeks who loved the idea of the immortality
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.400]   of the soul, but disliked the idea of the resurrection of this body.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.780]   Christianity is not Greek in this regard.
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.140]   The body will be raised from the dead, and the bodily resurrection of Jesus in a form
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.940]   that could be recognized and that could be touched and that could eat fish was the prototype
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.580]   of our resurrection body.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.820]   So Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 20, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.620]   of those who have fallen asleep.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.780]   And when people scoff in this chapter and say, "What kind of body do they come with?"
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.500]   He answers in verse 42, "So is it with the resurrection of the dead.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.820]   What is sown is perishable.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.800]   What is raised is imperishable.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.140]   What is sown in dishonor is raised in glory.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.100]   It is sown in weakness.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.620]   It is raised in power.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.700]   It is sown a natural body.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.840]   It is raised a spiritual body."
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.900]   So the resurrection of the body, absolutely essential to Christian doctrine.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:46.700]   Now the question is, what about the time between death and the resurrection of the body?
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.580]   Why is it sometimes called sleep?
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.580]   And we were talking earlier, Tony, as we began this, that this is really fresh for me because
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.780]   at eight o'clock this morning, a very good friend of mine went into this state.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.980]   So where is she?
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.980]   What's happening to her?
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.500]   I mean, this is right now, it is three hours and 16 minutes.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   Picture it.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.940]   He is three hours and 16 minutes into what we're talking about right now.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.940]   That's awesome.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.140]   That is awesome to think about.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.280]   So here's what the Bible says about sleep.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.340]   This is why he raises the question.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.020]   Since we believe that Jesus died, this is 1 Thessalonians 4, since we believe that Jesus
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.100]   died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.100]   asleep.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.100]   All right?
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.900]   That's a reference to Christians who have died.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.380]   Now why does he say it that way?
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.540]   Or 1 Corinthians 15, 17, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, you're
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.860]   still in your sins, then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished."
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.020]   So another reference to falling asleep as a picture of dying.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.660]   And then there's Jesus, where he raised the little girl.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.700]   We named our daughter after this experience where he says, "Talathakum," and he raises
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.540]   this little girl from the dead.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.640]   And we know that she's dead because in Mark, I think, 535, they say, "Your daughter has
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.260]   died."
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.940]   And when Jesus arrives to deal with this, he says, "Why are you making such a commotion
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.940]   and weeping?
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.380]   The child is not dead but sleeping."
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.940]   Well, she was dead, and he calls it sleeping.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.500]   Why?
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.700]   My answer is that this is the way the body looks and acts.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:58.820]   It is simply a description of death by a softer picture of what it actually looks like.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.980]   If you've ever looked at a person who's just died, have they died or are they just sleeping?
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.060]   Because they look like they're just there, like they've always looked and they're just
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.060]   asleep.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.980]   So I think it's a picture, it's a pictorial description in a softer way of the actual
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.260]   reality that they've died.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.220]   Now, why do I say that?
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.940]   Why do I jump to that idea of meaning instead of just saying, "Well, no, no, they are not
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.940]   conscious on the other side of death.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.820]   They really are undergoing something like soul sleep.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.140]   They will have no consciousness until the resurrection."
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.420]   Why don't I say that?
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.620]   And the reason I don't is because Jesus and Paul teach otherwise.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.140]   So for example, the two key passages in Paul are Philippians 121, "To me to live is Christ
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.240]   and to die is gain.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.960]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me, yet which I shall choose I cannot
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   tell.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.000]   I am hard-pressed between the two.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:19.120]   My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better."
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.900]   So when Paul contemplates his own dying, he calls it gain, not because he's going to go
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.180]   unconscious and have zero experience for another thousand years, but because he goes into the
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:39.280]   presence of Christ, with Christ, in a deeper, more intimate way, and it is, he says, "vastly
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.560]   better than anything he's known here."
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.180]   And then he says the same thing in 2 Corinthians 5, 6, "We're always of good courage.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.040]   We know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord, for we walk by
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.640]   faith and not by sight.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:04.240]   Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.680]   the Lord.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.840]   So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him."
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:20.360]   So dying in the body means going to be at home with the Lord.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.800]   Notice Jesus.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:29.120]   He tells this story about the rich man and Lazarus, and he doesn't say that it's a parable.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.960]   Now I don't know for sure, frankly, whether it was a parable or not, but he doesn't say
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.540]   it was a parable.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.580]   He just describes it like it really happened, and if it did happen or if it is a parable,
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:50.860]   it seems to be making the point that after death, there's not oblivion or sleep, unconsciousness.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.800]   There is life in torment or in bliss.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   So it goes like this.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.820]   "There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.820]   every day.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.980]   And at his gate was laid a poor man, Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.860]   with what fell from the master's table.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.460]   Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:21.100]   The poor man died and was carried by angels to Abraham's side.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.540]   The rich man also died and was buried.
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:33.700]   And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.180]   at his side."
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:43.820]   So the picture Jesus paints, parable or something that really happened, is one of a conscious
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:49.300]   life in torment or in happiness beyond death.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:58.180]   So my conclusion is that Christians have a double encouragement for those who are dying
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.320]   or have died.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:10.740]   For the believer who trusts in Jesus Christ, Christ's blood and righteousness have removed
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:19.880]   the condemnation for every believer and secured for us both final resurrection of the body
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:29.460]   in a new heaven and a new earth and now, after death, an intimate, sweet experience of being
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.080]   in Christ's presence between death and resurrection.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.120]   It is a blessed hope in both ways.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   We're safe.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.040]   We're safe in him now.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:47.080]   We'll be safe in his presence at the moment of death, and we will be supremely happy in
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.160]   a new and healthy body forever and ever in the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.480]   What a glorious hope we have in Christ.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.080]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for sharing these thoughts in the midst of your
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   recent loss.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080]   We really appreciate it.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.760]   Well, we're going to end the week by talking about a subject that rarely, if ever, gets
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.800]   addressed, and it's the topic of self-hatred.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.080]   What hope does the gospel offer those who struggle with self-condemnation and self-hatred
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.360]   in any of its many various manifestations?
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.120]   I've asked our friend and respected Bible counselor, David Powlison, to join us to explain,
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.320]   and he has agreed to appear with us tomorrow.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll see you then.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.780]   Bye.
