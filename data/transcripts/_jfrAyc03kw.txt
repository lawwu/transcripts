[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Well, God is loving and God is patient and God is kind.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080]   But is God also severe?
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.960]   Can we say that?
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.040]   Any perceptive Bible reader who believes in God's absolute sovereignty is eventually going
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.720]   to ask this question, like a listener named Tynica.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.880]   "Hi, Pastor John.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.280]   I'm wondering if it's wrong to say that God is severe.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.720]   Early in prayer, in a train of thought, I was led to use that exact word 'severe,'
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.080]   although it seemed to me to be sacrilegious.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.160]   After looking it up in the dictionary, it appeared to me that some definitions of the
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.120]   word 'severe' are negative.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.000]   In the prayer, I was thinking about God's character, that He is loving, kind, patient,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.240]   and I added 'severe' to the list.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.000]   And like I said, it didn't sound right.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.680]   I wondered if 'serious' or 'sober' are better words.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.600]   To name a few examples that I found in the dictionary would be 'harsh,' 'unnecessarily
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.760]   extreme,' 'grave.'
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.400]   I'd love your thoughts on this, Pastor John.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400]   Is God severe?"
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:11.520]   I think maybe the reason why for Tynica, listing severity as one of God's attributes or as
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:21.440]   a definition of His character sounds awkward to us is mainly because we generally expect
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.240]   the attributes of God or the marks of His character to be carried through continuously
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.160]   in all His action.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.840]   For example, if we call Him wise, we don't mean, "Well, sometimes He's wise and sometimes
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.160]   He's foolish."
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.000]   When we call Him good, we don't mean, "Well, sometimes He's good and sometimes He's bad."
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.280]   And when we call Him just, we don't mean that sometimes He's just and sometimes He's unjust.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.040]   But if we call Him severe, that pattern won't work.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.960]   That's why I think it sticks in her throat.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.080]   What we would mean if we called God severe is that sometimes, in some circumstances,
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.800]   in response to some things, He is indeed severe, and other times that severity is replaced
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.960]   by gentleness.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:34.600]   So I would switch the question from, "Is God severe?" to, "Does God ever act in a severe
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.360]   way?"
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.840]   Are there particular circumstances where His wisdom, His justice, His goodness, in fact,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.520]   is severe, and are there circumstances where He's not severe?
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.840]   So let me give you a couple examples from Scripture, and then you can decide how to
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.480]   say it in the situation you find yourself.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.600]   What we find is that whenever God is called severe in a particular circumstance, it's
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.400]   described with whatever it is that called forth the severity.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.600]   For example, in Luke 12, Jesus told the story of several servants who knew their master's
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.640]   will and some who didn't know it, and the master responds differently to different servants.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.840]   Let me read it to you.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.240]   This is Luke 12, 47.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.760]   That servant who knew his master's will but did not get ready or act according to his
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.560]   will will receive a severe beating.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.320]   It's a picture of the final judgment.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.360]   But the one who did not know and did not deserve—did not know what deserved a beating—will receive
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.600]   a light beating.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   Everyone to whom much was given of him much will be required.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:12.680]   So yes, there will be a severity of judgment, and the severity is in proportion to the rebelliousness
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.720]   of the sin.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:23.480]   So severity does not mark God's behavior pervasively, but only occasionally in response
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.720]   to particular attitudes and behaviors.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.560]   Here is the most important illustration of God's severity in the Bible, I think, because
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.040]   it is embedded in a context that gives us a sense of how relevant it is for us today.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.900]   This is Romans 11, 19, following.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.200]   You will say then—so Jesus now says to the Gentiles who are reading him—you will say,
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   "Jewish branches were broken off so that I, I a Gentile, might be grafted in."
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.280]   And the picture is grafted into the Abrahamic covenant of promise.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.600]   And then Paul says, "Well, that's true.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.820]   They were broken off because of their unbelief.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.620]   But you stand fast through belief, through faith.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.440]   So don't become proud, but fear."
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.040]   That is, fear falling into unbelief.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   Fear unbelief.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:31.520]   "For if God did not spare the natural branches," the Jewish people who did not believe in Jesus,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.280]   "neither will he spare you for your unbelief."
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   Verse 22, "Note then," and that's a strong word.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.720]   "Look, behold, watch, hear what I'm saying.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.280]   Note then the kindness and the severity."
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.280]   There's the word.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   "Note then."
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.580]   So he's saying to us Gentile Christians, "Hey, wake up.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.040]   I want you to look at his kindness, and I want you to look at his severity."
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.480]   Severity, I'm still reading now, "severity toward those who have fallen," that is, the
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:15.200]   broken off branches of unbelief, "but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   his kindness."
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.240]   That is, keep trusting him, keep having faith in him, keep treasuring his kindness.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.820]   "Otherwise," Paul says, "you too will be cut off.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:33.080]   And even they, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.200]   the power to graft them in."
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.800]   The reason this text is so important is because, well, two things.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.820]   One, severity is contrasted with kindness, so that we can see clearly that sometimes
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.440]   God acts with one, and other times he acts with the other.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.120]   In other words, severity is not an overarching quality of all God's action, like justice
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:09.240]   or wisdom is or goodness, but is one expression of his justice and wisdom and goodness.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.720]   It's the counterpoint of kindness.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.400]   Sometimes one is appropriate, sometimes the other.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.920]   And here's the second thing that's so important about this text.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.840]   It tells us directly as Christians that we should think about.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.040]   We should think about God's severity.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.520]   It says, "Note well, look well."
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.940]   In other words, severity really matters.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.680]   We should think about it.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.360]   It should be part of our thinking about God.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.200]   Verse 22 is a command.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.880]   "Look, note well the kindness and severity of God."
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:55.640]   And he says this right after he gives the command, "Don't become proud, but fear."
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:04.920]   So fear there is fearing unbelief, fear the failure to rest in God, fear the failure to
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:12.240]   enjoy God, fear not being changed by God's kindness.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.180]   This is so important.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:21.360]   And so contrary to the way most people think about living the Christian life, they think,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.560]   lots of people think, there's no place for fear in the Christian life.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:36.080]   But Paul in Romans 11:20 explicitly commands Christians to fear, to fear unbelief.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:44.740]   And to make it really paradoxical, we could say, he commands us to fear the failure to
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.180]   be fearless by trusting Jesus.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.840]   Let me say it again.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.180]   He commands us to fear what?
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.440]   The short answer is unbelief.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.960]   But let's say it like this.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:03.860]   He commands us to fear the failure to be fearless by trusting Jesus.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.340]   Fear basing your fearlessness on pride.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.740]   Base your fearlessness on faith in Jesus.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.320]   And fear every other kind of fearlessness.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:22.780]   So I would conclude with Taneeka that when we are giving a list of God's overarching
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.820]   attributes, including severity, would probably be misleading.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.700]   No, those don't include severity in that list.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:41.820]   But we should say it's one of the ways that God acts in some circumstances, and it underlines
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.380]   the need for Christians to fear unbelief.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:53.120]   One of the main reasons for us to know his severity is so that we should fear the kind
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:01.420]   of unbelief that God treats so severely, and then fly, fly to the kindness that he promises
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.780]   to all who trust him.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.780]   Amen.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.780]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.300]   And thank you for this question, Taneeka.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.420]   And thank you all for listening.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.500]   To search through our archives, read transcripts of episodes, or ask a question of your own,
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.540]   go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.380]   We are in the midst of Holy Week now, a season when we rivet our gaze on the cross of Christ,
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.420]   and we have several questions about the crucifixion of our Savior.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.740]   And we will address two of those questions this week.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.660]   On Friday, we're going to look more closely at why Simon of Cyrene carried the cross of
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.380]   Christ, a curious little story with several interesting implications for us and our lives.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.100]   Don't miss that episode on Friday.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.900]   But next time on Wednesday, we're going to look at the role of the Holy Spirit in the
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.060]   crucifixion.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.380]   On the cross, the triune God is at work, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.580]   But how is the Spirit at work during Holy Week specifically?
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.660]   It's a great question coming in from you, Shrewd listeners, asking really great questions.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.780]   I am your host, Tony Reike.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.780]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.300]   [END]
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:08.300]   1. What is the Holy Spirit's role in the crucifixion of our Savior?
