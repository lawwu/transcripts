[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.080]   Paul's epistle to the Galatians in the sixth chapter and the fourteenth verse.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.000]   The fourteenth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.600]   But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.000]   the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.400]   We come back to a further consideration of this great and glorious affirmation which
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.160]   is here made by the great apostle.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.320]   In these words he states what his position is as a Christian and he's contrasting himself
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320]   with other people.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.880]   He does that in the immediate context.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:01.000]   He talks about other people who glory in the flesh, but he says, "As for me, God forbid
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.440]   that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.440]   Now, we've been at pains to emphasize that this is the Christian attitude to what is
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.880]   the central fact, after all, in connection with our Christian faith.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.200]   It is the cross on which the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.160]   Here we are going to meet at the communion table to eat bread and to drink wine, which
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.000]   are reminders and memorials of the fact that the Son of God was crucified on a tree, on
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.560]   a cross, on Calvary's hill outside Jerusalem.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.360]   This is the center of our Christian faith, and that's what the apostle is telling us
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.200]   at this point.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.160]   But the thing we are emphasizing is this, that the Christian glories in the cross.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.000]   It is to him the most wonderful thing that has ever happened.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.040]   Now, it's very important we should be clear about this.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   Sometimes the Christian church herself, let's admit it quite readily, has presented the
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.800]   cross in an atmosphere of gloom and of pathos and of tragedy.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.240]   Of course, from one angle, the cross is the greatest tragedy that the world has ever known,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.280]   but that's not the Christian attitude towards it.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.100]   The Christian attitude is the one that is indicated here by the great apostle.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.880]   It is something in which a Christian glories, because it is by the cross, as the apostle
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.520]   tells us here, that we are saved.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.640]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   By whom?
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.780]   By which?
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.800]   By what happened to him there upon the cross.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.120]   The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.880]   Now, it's very important, therefore, that we should be clear about this.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.320]   Let me put it in this way tonight.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.920]   The Christian church, very rightly, has always referred to the day on which our Lord's death
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.000]   is commemorated as Good Friday.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.640]   I remember a man coming to me once, and he was a professional man and an able man.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.040]   He said, "You know, I can't understand why you call it Good Friday."
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.440]   I said, "Well, what should we call it?"
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.760]   He said, "You should call it Bad Friday."
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.960]   It was the day on which that terrible thing happened.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.800]   "Why do you call it Good Friday?"
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.720]   And thereby, of course, the poor man revealed to me that he had never really understood
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   the meaning of it.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.960]   He'd never understood what happened there.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.320]   A man who objects to calling it Good Friday is a man who is admitting that he has never
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.280]   gloried in the cross.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.400]   It's Good Friday because of the wonderful things that happened there.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.760]   It's a Good Friday because it was the Friday on which the Son of God did that without which
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.160]   none of us could ever be saved, and none of us could ever come to a knowledge of God.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.040]   Now, that's just another way of saying we glory in it.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   Good Friday.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.200]   The best day that has ever happened in the history of the human race.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.240]   Well, of course, the moment I say that, I am testing the view of everybody listening
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.580]   to me at this moment on the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.500]   If you don't end by seeing that it was good, glorious, wonderful, the best thing that has
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.120]   ever happened, somewhere or another you are misunderstanding it and you are misinterpreting
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   it.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.440]   But the Apostle glories in it, and we've been considering why he does.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.840]   And that's what we're going to continue doing tonight.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.360]   It is the thing, he says, by which we are saved, delivered from the world.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.600]   It is the thing in which, as we've been saying, one rarely sees fully the person and the glory
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.180]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.600]   It is also the place, the thing in which one sees the glory of God the Father, the truth
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.680]   concerning the Father.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.640]   So we glory in the cross as we look at it, as we see it showing these various aspects
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.520]   of the truth to us.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   And then last Sunday night we were looking together at it from this more personal standpoint
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.320]   of what it really does to us.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.040]   It separates us from the world, and our greatest enemy is the world.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.480]   Here it is.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.880]   We are what we are as we saw, because of the outlook and the mind of the world, the
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.960]   mind of man as he is by nature, and before God deals with him through the Lord Jesus
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.740]   Christ by the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.140]   But you see, we still haven't finished.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.200]   And that's an important thing in itself.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.080]   I'm quite sure the trouble with most of us is this, is that we've never seen the greatness
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   of the cross.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   We've never seen this glory as we ought.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.760]   The cross is the biggest thing in the whole universe.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.720]   There's no end to it.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.520]   That's one of the reasons why the apostle does glory in it.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.960]   I reminded you a few Sunday nights back how Isaac Watts puts it in his hymn, "When I
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.760]   survey the wondrous cross," he says.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.480]   You've got to look at it, and you can stand all around it, look at it from different aspects
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.560]   and angles, and every time you do so you'll see some fresh glory, you'll see a new aspect
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.880]   of truth, you'll see something that you've never seen before.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.680]   There's no end to this cross.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680]   That's why he glories in it.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.720]   You can't glory in something small.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.640]   What's our view of the cross?
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.640]   What's our estimate of the size of the cross?
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.600]   Some people make it a very small thing.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.400]   They reduce our Lord to just a pacifist or something like that.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.840]   They reduce him to the level of something that's been done by many other men.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.280]   They've never seen the glory, the bigness, the greatness, the grandeur, the vastness,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:10.400]   the extent of this cross, which Isaac Watts invites us all to survey with him.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.800]   Well, now then, we must go on with this survey, this surveying of the cross.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.200]   He does all the things we've been dealing with, but I want to call attention to another
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.400]   aspect tonight.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.800]   We want to look at the cross tonight in this sense.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.440]   We want to see in it the way in which it delivers us from the power of the devil.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.560]   I wonder how often you've thought of the cross like that.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.820]   The cross is a great victory.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:48.160]   The cross as the final move, as it were, here on earth in a great battle, a great conflict,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.960]   a great crusade.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.560]   I call your attention there for tonight to the cross as it displays to us the Lord Jesus
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.240]   Christ as a victor, as a conqueror.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:11.480]   We've just been singing that hymn, "O Jesus, King most wonderful, thou conqueror renowned,"
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.000]   that aspect.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.880]   I wonder how often we've considered it in that way.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.600]   When you think of the cross instinctively, what you see there, what you find, do you
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   find all these things there?
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.760]   Now, we're trying to see why it was the apostle says, "God forbid that I should glory or make
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.200]   my burst in anything save in this cross."
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.720]   Everything we see in it helps us to understand why he gloried in it and why we should glory
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:47.120]   in it and why we should thrill at every recollection of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.000]   Now then, I want to call your attention to this aspect of the matter.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.440]   That's why I read that portion from the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Colossians,
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.280]   because in the 15th verse there he puts it very clearly and very plainly.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.440]   He says, "And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly,
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.280]   triumphing over them in it, through it, by it."
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.600]   That's what's happening, he says, on the cross.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.880]   He's been saying that what happens there is blotting out the handwriting of ordinances
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.160]   that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.160]   to his cross.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.720]   We've considered that.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:35.240]   And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.280]   He's ridiculed them, triumphing over them, through it or by it.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.120]   That's the matter I want to call your attention to tonight.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:54.600]   The cross as this marvelous exposition of the triumph of the Son of God over the devil
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.800]   and all his forces and powers.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.420]   Now then, let's look at it like this.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.280]   This subject, you see, follows on very logically and indeed quite inevitably for those who
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.040]   believe the Bible, from the matter that we were considering together last Sunday night.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.000]   The apostle says that he glories in the cross because it is by the cross that the world
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.560]   is being crucified to him and him to the world.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.720]   And we saw what that meant.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.680]   But you see, we can't leave it at that.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.600]   I say, and I said last Sunday night, I think I demonstrated to you that all our troubles
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.040]   in our personal lives and in the whole life of the world tonight is due to the fact that
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.200]   the world is what it is.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.920]   This outlook, this way that man thinks apart from God, that's the cause of wars, it's
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.160]   the cause of everything.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.120]   I think I was able to prove that to you.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.440]   Yes, but we can't leave it at that.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.000]   We're bound to ask another question.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.800]   Why is the world like that?
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.320]   Why should the world be like that?
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.040]   Now that's, I suggest to you, the most profound question that we can ever put.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.480]   And it's the question that is always put by the Bible.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.520]   That's why the Bible is the profoundest book in the world tonight.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.440]   There are clever people tonight who are not in places of worship.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.320]   Ninety percent of the people of this country are not in places of worship.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.960]   How have they spent their Sunday?
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.160]   Well, they've been reading the Sunday newspapers.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.080]   I don't mean now of necessity the reports of the law courts or the police courts.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.120]   I'm thinking of the sophisticated, clever people who've been reading the articles.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.420]   These articles of the great thinkers and the reviews of the learned books on philosophy
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.600]   and history and various other matters.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.800]   These men who've long since given up considering Christianity because of their learning and
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   their knowledge.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.920]   These men who are rarely concerned about doing something about this world and putting it
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920]   right.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:53.200]   Now, all I've got to say about them is this, that the trouble with all that is that it's
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.120]   so indescribably superficial.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.160]   That's why it never comes to anything.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.480]   That's why all civilization doesn't come to anything.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.760]   That's why in spite of all the effort of the centuries, we are in this terrible predicament
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.360]   as a world tonight.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.080]   And the trouble is entirely due to the fact that they've never really faced the problem
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   of the condition of men and of the world in a profound manner.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.980]   It's all so superficial.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.280]   It's almost alarming this.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.480]   It's still going on, not a week passes, but that we find that some new royal commission
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.440]   or some process of investigation is to be set up.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.000]   We are going to tackle this problem, they say, juvenile delinquency and all these other
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   things.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   But they've been doing it all before.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   There's nothing new.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.920]   It's all because they've never asked the fundamental question.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.840]   And the fundamental question is this, why is the condition what it is?
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.040]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.320]   Why is there this worldly outlook that we were considering last Sunday night?
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.960]   That's the profound question.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:07.040]   And it's the question I claim that is raised and answered only by the Bible.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.960]   Let me put the answer before you.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:18.720]   It is, as I say, this great biblical teaching about the devil and his forces and his powers.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.080]   Now I haven't the time tonight to take you through all the evidence, but I must point
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.400]   out to you some of the most important bits of evidence.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   Take it in the teaching of our Lord himself.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:37.800]   It's in the 11th chapter of the gospel according to Luke, verse 14 and following.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.440]   He was casting out a devil and it was dumb.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.680]   And it came to pass when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake and the people wondered.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.080]   But some of them said, "He casteth out devils through Beelzebub, the chief of the devils,
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.040]   others tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven."
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.840]   Now but this is our Lord's teaching.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.320]   He says, "But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.680]   is come upon you."
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.520]   Then here's the word.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:11.080]   "When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.840]   And when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him, he taketh from him all
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.200]   his armour wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils."
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.960]   Now that is our Lord's own account of what he was doing in this world.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:33.080]   The strong man armed, he says, "Keepeth his palace and when he does so, his goods are
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.080]   in peace."
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:41.160]   Now that's our Lord's way of describing this world and life in this world.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.720]   Life in this world is like a great palace.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.680]   And this palace is dominated by this keeper, this strong man armed.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.420]   And he keepeth his goods in peace, which means that he's governing them, he's ruling them,
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.760]   and he is controlling them.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.520]   And they can do nothing at all about him, they can't get out.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.480]   He's a strong man and he's armed and he keeps his goods in peace.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.080]   But he says, "When a stronger than he shall come upon him," that's his way of describing
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.080]   himself.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:21.000]   He's the stronger who comes, he shall come upon him and overcome him and take from him
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   all his armour wherein he trusted and he will divide his spoils.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.560]   He will release these goods that were kept in peace and set them at liberty.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.200]   That's our Lord's own description of his work in this world.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.360]   He has come to deal with this strong man armed who is the devil, who keeps men and women
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.880]   in the thralldom of his own tyranny and power.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.760]   Now let me give you one or two more illustrations of this same teaching as you find it in the
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.120]   teaching of the apostles.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.720]   The apostle Paul, for instance, puts it like this in the second epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.120]   chapter 4 and verse 4.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.200]   I'm giving you this evidence for one reason only, that I know that the average man in
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.760]   the world tonight not only doesn't believe in the devil and his powers, but he thinks
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.800]   this is the greatest joke of all.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.560]   And indeed there are so many in the church who no longer believe in the devil.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.440]   We've all become so clever and that's why the world is getting worse.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.320]   We don't believe in the one who really causes the whole trouble.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.680]   So listen to Paul in 2 Corinthians 4, 4.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:34.880]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.440]   blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.800]   who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.960]   Same thing.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.480]   God of this world, blinding and keeping in the dark.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.720]   And take another one, Ephesians 2, 2.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.960]   Heweth he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past ye walked according
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.680]   to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.280]   that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.980]   Or listen to Paul in Ephesians 6, 10 and 12.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:21.240]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:27.480]   the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.400]   The teaching isn't confined to the apostle Paul.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.680]   All these apostles repeated the teaching that was given to them by their blessed Lord and
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   Master.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:42.800]   So the apostle John puts it like this in his first epistle in chapter 5, verses 18 and
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   19.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.240]   We know that whosoever is born of God doth not go on sinning, but he that is begotten
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.200]   of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:59.780]   We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.680]   And the word means the whole world lies in the embrace of the wicked one.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.600]   He's got them in his arms.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.560]   He's embracing them and holding them to himself.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.560]   The whole world.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.760]   Now, those are just specimens of biblical teaching.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:22.000]   And what I'm trying to put to you and to suggest to you is this, that this is the explanation
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.240]   as to why the world is as it is.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.400]   Isn't it about time we faced this question?
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   Why are things as they are?
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.960]   Why have we had the two world wars?
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.360]   "Ah," says somebody, "the Kaiser, Mussolini, Hitler."
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.860]   You believe that?
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.320]   What made those men what they were?
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.920]   Even if they were mainly responsible, what made them what they were?
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.920]   Is it merely men?
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.600]   Are we merely wrestling against flesh and blood?
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.760]   What's the matter, I say, with men and women at the present time?
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.840]   Well, in spite of all our advantages, all our education and all the rest of it, why
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.120]   all this moral muddle?
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.920]   And not only why the moral muddle, why this almost incredible folly that is being put
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.080]   before us so regularly day by day?
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.360]   Why do people behave in such an utterly mad and unintelligent manner?
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.440]   Why can they be amused by the things by which they can be amused with the world as it is
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   tonight?
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   What's the explanation?
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.280]   Now, that's the question.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.200]   And the answer which the Bible gives is this, it isn't merely human nature.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.300]   Man I know is a fool, we're all fools.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.000]   But even that isn't enough to explain the present state of the world.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.240]   It isn't enough to explain every individual of us.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.800]   For we are all conscious that there's something wrong and we strive to be better, but we always
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   fail.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   What is it?
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.040]   What is it that has dogged every human effort to improve the world?
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.400]   What is it that vitiates all human effort?
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:56.480]   Why is it that in spite of all the effort of civilization after civilization that the
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.720]   world is as it is tonight, what is this thing that is dogging the fate of men and ever holding
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   him down?
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.280]   That's the question.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.600]   And the Bible, I say, has an answer to the question.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.400]   And it is the only answer to the question.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.920]   It isn't men only, it isn't human nature.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.880]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, we are not suffering merely from a kind of evolutionary
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.160]   lag.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.560]   How much longer is the lag going to last?
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.760]   No, no, my dear friends, there's no evidence of this upward march.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.200]   The world is as it's always been in this terrible predicament that it's in tonight.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.800]   No, no, it isn't men.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.720]   There's something behind men, something deeper than men.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   What is it?
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.840]   Well, I say the biblical answer is that it is the devil.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:54.960]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:01.480]   the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high or in
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.800]   heavenly places.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.480]   Now, let me put this to you as briefly as I can this evening.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:14.680]   The whole trouble with the world, according to this book, was initiated by this one who
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.640]   is called the devil.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.400]   You see, there is an unseen spiritual world.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.080]   That's where the world goes wrong, isn't it?
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.200]   I'm not here to criticize statesmen, nor here to criticize philosophers, nor anybody
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   else.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:36.280]   But I am here to say this, and it's simply a truism, that all their efforts are valueless.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.920]   They all come to nothing.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.920]   Why?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:44.480]   Well, because they don't recognize the unseen spiritual realm.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.280]   They always operate in the realm of the seen.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:52.320]   They're operating with human nature, so they make their investigations and they try to
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   understand.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.720]   They don't realize that there's something bigger than man.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.920]   There is an unseen spiritual realm which is constantly influencing us.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.880]   And you see, according to the Bible, that unseen spiritual realm can be divided into
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.320]   two main sections.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.520]   There is God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.840]   There is the devil and all his forces and powers, the principalities and powers, all
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.040]   that he governs and controls.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.640]   And according to this teaching, all these powers are exerting an influence upon this
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.240]   world and upon the mind of men.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:36.000]   And the whole explanation of the predicament of men, individually and collectively, tonight,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.120]   is that it is the result of the work and the activity and the efforts of the devil and
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.120]   his powers.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.920]   Now, we're not given many details about this.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   All we are told is that the devil was in existence and manifested his power the moment man was
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   created.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.520]   He was there indeed before man.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.320]   He is an angelic spirit, an angelic being.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.280]   All angelic beings were created by God and he made them all perfect.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:10.400]   But we are told of this one who has so great power that in his pride and arrogance he rebelled
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.120]   against God.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.020]   He wasn't content to be subservient to God.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.560]   He wasn't content to be a servant of God.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   He wanted to be equal with God.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:25.160]   So he rebelled against God, we are told, and persuaded a number of other angels to do the
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.440]   same thing with him.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.920]   So you get the devil and the fallen angels.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.680]   And they are consumed with a passion of antagonism against God.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.360]   The devil hates God.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.340]   He fell, I say, because of that.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.120]   But since his fall, he has hated God still more.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:51.080]   And the devil has really only one ambition, and that is to ruin God's world.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.360]   So this is what he does.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   God makes a world, he makes it perfect.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.840]   He makes men in his own image.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.920]   Man was made perfect.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.320]   And the devil hated it.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:07.360]   And the devil knows that the best way in which he can harm God and his name and his glory
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.720]   is to ruin God's creation.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:15.680]   So he came in and he tempted men and men in his folly listened to him and he fell.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.920]   And he went into a state of sin.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.400]   And he dragged down the whole cosmos with him.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.460]   Now that is the biblical explanation of the problem.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.400]   You see, it started long ago.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.960]   That is why the Bible starts its history in the Garden of Eden.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.400]   It's interested primarily in man, in the creation of man and in the condition of man.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:43.880]   And it says that all the troubles in the world have resulted from that initial mistake and
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:49.480]   error of man when he listened to the devil and was lifted up himself in pride as the
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.920]   devil had been before him.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.840]   And down he went, dragging the whole creation down with him.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.800]   Now then, what is the result of all this?
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   Well, the result of all this, according to the Bible, is the very thing I've been reading
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.320]   to you in these quotations I've put before you.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:19.160]   Man in listening to the temptation and the enticement of the devil became the slave of
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.200]   the devil.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.160]   He became an absolute serf in the hands of the devil.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.880]   And his life ever since has been dominated by the devil.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.400]   That's why he's called the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.160]   the children of disobedience.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.400]   That is why he's called the god of this world who blinds.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.440]   The whole of the human race has become the slave of the devil.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.400]   He's the strong man arm that keepeth his goods in peace.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.840]   Now let's be clear about this.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.320]   The Bible tells us that the power of the devil is tremendous.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.200]   That is what makes the world so tragic tonight.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.660]   It doesn't even believe in the devil.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.760]   And it doesn't realize, therefore, that all its troubles are due to this tremendous tyrant
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.640]   with this awful power.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:20.760]   Listen to the Son of God, the strong man arm keepeth his goods in peace.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.280]   He dominates and his power is a tremendous power.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.600]   Or take those words of the apostle Paul again.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.600]   "Don't you think," he says, "that the problem of living is a problem of flesh and blood?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   You are not up against merely your own weaknesses or the weaknesses of other men and women.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.960]   Behind all that are the principalities and the powers, the rulers of the darkness of
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:52.160]   this world, the spiritual wickedness up in the heavenly places, exerting this awful power
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.080]   upon the entire human race."
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.920]   There is the explanation.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.400]   Let's take it step by step.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.480]   I say it's a tremendous power.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.280]   I prove it in this way.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:13.320]   The power of the devil, the power of evil, is so great that every human being ever born
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.000]   into this world has been defeated by it.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   You read your Old Testament.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.360]   There are some very great men there, Abram and the patriarchs and the prophets and people
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.040]   like that, but every one of them sinned.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.000]   Every one of them fell down before the devil.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.880]   Yea, the Bible puts it as strongly as this.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:37.800]   Even man when he was perfect, Adam, a perfect man made in the image of God, was defeated
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   by the devil.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.720]   The devil was so powerful, so subtle.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.280]   His ingenuity is such.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.720]   No man has ever been able to stand against him, even a perfect man.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:54.240]   The apostle Paul sums it all up by saying, "All have sinned and come short of the glory
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240]   of God.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.440]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.880]   There's never been a human being in this world that has lived a righteous life and
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.760]   has satisfied God, not one.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.920]   The whole world therefore lieth guilty before God."
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   Why?
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:19.000]   Well, it's because of this terrible power of the devil, who dominates and who controls
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and who masters.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.360]   How does he do it?
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.320]   I mustn't keep you with this.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.860]   He dominates and controls the mind.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.200]   He hates God.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.040]   He persuades the human race to hate God.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.560]   I've quoted the verse to you, 2 Corinthians 4, 3, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.320]   them that are lost."
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.160]   You see, the devil doesn't want anybody to believe in God and in the Son of God, so he
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.400]   blinds their minds.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.640]   There's nothing new about unbelief.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.120]   You're not being particularly modern or clever by not being a Christian.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.800]   There's always been opposition to this.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.280]   The Bible's full of it.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.520]   There's nothing new about unbelief.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.000]   You're not being particularly modern or clever by not being a Christian.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.680]   There's always been opposition to this.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.200]   The Bible's full of it.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.360]   He doesn't conceal it.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:12.400]   No, no, the gospel has never been believed by men and women en masse in this world.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   Never.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   "Few there be that find it," says our Lord.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.640]   "Enter in at the straight gate.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.120]   Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:27.480]   which go in thereat, because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.680]   life, and few there be that find it."
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.480]   The devil dominates the life of the bulk of mankind.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   He's always done it.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.600]   And you know, you're not being anything new or different by rejecting this gospel and
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.920]   this preaching and the teaching of the Bible.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.000]   Mankind has always been doing that sort of thing.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.480]   The devil has been dominating.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.120]   He governs the mind.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:53.400]   The apostle puts it again in that great phrase of his in 1 Corinthians 2, 14.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:58.120]   He says, "The natural men receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.400]   foolishness unto him.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.240]   Neither can he, because they are spiritually discerned."
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.520]   The clever people of the first century ridiculed the cross as much as the clever people of
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.040]   today did.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.640]   They didn't believe in the Son of God.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.440]   They didn't believe in his atoning death.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.440]   No, no.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   They ridiculed it.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.060]   They said, "It's foolishness."
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.640]   It was foolishness to the Greeks.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.520]   It is still foolishness to such people.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.520]   There's nothing new.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.760]   You see, it's all a manifestation of the devil dominating the mind of man.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.560]   He doesn't allow him to think freely.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.320]   He keeps men in blinkers.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.800]   He only lets him see what he wants him to see.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.920]   And the whole difficulty is to see the truth.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.640]   You try and you'll soon find and feel something of the power of the devil.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:47.680]   But then he not only controls the mind, he controls the desires.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:53.920]   Why is there always an additional sweetness in stolen or prohibited fruit?
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.440]   Why does every child immediately want to do something that its parents tell it not to
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.360]   do?
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   Why is sin so pleasing and so pleasant?
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.400]   Answer that question.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.880]   Where do these desires come from?
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.020]   The answer given here is that they all come from the devil.
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.880]   And he governs our actions, our wills, in exactly the same way.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.000]   He rebelled against God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.200]   He wants everybody else to rebel against God.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.320]   And he persuades everybody else to rebel against God.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.400]   He makes us hate God.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.320]   He makes us hate God's laws.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.640]   The natural mind is enmity against God.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.800]   It's not subject to the law of God.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.480]   Neither indeed can be.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.040]   Man by nature is a God-hater, as I've often put it in this pulpit before.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.320]   That's why the newspapers are always ready to put in their paragraphs.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.760]   If they can find a man who's just said he doesn't believe in God, in it'll go.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.240]   If they find a Sunday school teacher who's fallen morally, they say, "Ex-Sunday school
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.040]   teacher has done this or that."
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.040]   They hate God.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.600]   They're against him and all his laws.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:57.440]   It's because they're dominated by the devil, the hater of God, who's reproducing himself
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.200]   in them.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.760]   And he not only dominates the mind and the desire and the will, he dominates the whole
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.600]   of life and he produces a fear.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.120]   You remember there's a great statement about this made by the author of the epistle to
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.400]   the Hebrews.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.200]   In the second chapter of his great epistle he puts it like this.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.760]   "For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he likewise himself took
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:30.480]   part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.520]   is the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   to bondage."
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:44.200]   And the long story of the human race shows this fear of death.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.400]   You get it in your Greek mythology.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.000]   You get it in all ancient literature, a fear of death.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.320]   Death pictured with a scythe coming and ever coming.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.720]   Why is mankind afraid of death?
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.720]   What's the cause of this?
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.560]   Well there's the answer you see.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.720]   It's a power exercised by the devil.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:08.780]   And he's able to exercise this power because of the law of God.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.800]   People don't believe in God, they don't believe in the law of God, but you see there is a
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.080]   relic and a remnant.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   It remains.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.800]   They've got a fear of death because they know that death is followed by judgment and the
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.400]   law condemns us all.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.800]   So man is afraid of death.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.440]   Death is the last specter and he's ever drawing nearer and man would like to evade death if
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.560]   he can, but he can't.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.720]   So he's in a kind of bondage, the end and death, and he does his best to postpone it.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.000]   He whistles in the dark, he pretends he doesn't believe in all this, and yet he does, the
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.200]   fear remains.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   Now I can show you all this in a brief picture.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.420]   Look at the pagan world.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.680]   Look at it in past centuries, look at it tonight.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.040]   It's the picture of the pagan world.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:58.400]   It is a picture of a life of fear, fearing the sun and the moon and the stars, fearing
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:05.600]   their own man-made gods, a life of fear, of squalor and of evil and of sin.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.680]   That's what the devil is producing.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.720]   God produces perfection, paradise.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.880]   The devil produces chaos.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.680]   He reduces God's order to chaos.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.920]   That's what the world is tonight.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:22.600]   It's the chaos of the devil, what God has made, turned by the devil in this power over
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   the minds of men and over their hearts and wills into the chaos with which we are familiar.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:41.120]   Now then, God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.120]   Why?
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:49.960]   Well, because he and he alone and there has delivered me from that throne, that tyranny,
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.440]   that dominion of Satan and of sin.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.520]   Let me show it to you.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.280]   The Son of God came into this world to do that very thing.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.840]   Let me give it to you in the words of John.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.840]   I want you to see that these are not my own theories, but that I'm just here expanding
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.120]   the scriptures to you.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.080]   John 3.8, "He that committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   beginning.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:23.680]   For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.600]   That's why he came.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:33.120]   The Son of God came into this world in order that he might destroy the works of the devil.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.840]   That's what he meant himself by talking about the strong man arm.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.680]   "When the one stronger than he cometh."
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   All humanity was too weak to fight the devil.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   He'd beaten them all.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.240]   He'd clubbed us on the head.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.840]   And none of us could get out of that castle, that palace of his.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.480]   He'd need somebody stronger.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.480]   He's come.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.640]   The Son of God has come that he might destroy the works of the devil.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.760]   That's why he was manifested.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.960]   And my dear friends, haven't you ever worked that out and followed it as it's depicted
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.320]   in the pages of the four Gospels?
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.680]   When you read your Gospels, do you just see our Lord fighting men?
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.120]   Well, if you do, you're a very superficial reader of your Bible.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   Don't you see him fighting this power that's behind men?
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.400]   Don't you see him engaged in this mortal combat with the devil?
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.520]   What an epic it is!
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.520]   What a fight!
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.520]   What a crusade!
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.640]   The Son of God has come down, what for?
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.960]   To fight the devil, because the devil is the master of men.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   Watch it.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.120]   The moment he's born, the devil tries to deal with him, doesn't he?
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.800]   Do you remember the edict that was sent out by a king called Herod?
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.360]   That all male children under two years should be murdered?
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   Why?
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.320]   He was trying to murder this one, the Son of God who'd been born as a baby in Bethlehem.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.240]   The fight began the moment our Lord was born.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   And it continued.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.320]   Look at him, tempted forty days and forty nights in the wilderness.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.320]   What is it?
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.200]   The devil trying to get him down.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   If thou be the Son of God, bow down before me and I'll give you the whole kingdoms of
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   this world.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.200]   He's trying to get him down.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.240]   He's trying to make him bow the knee to him.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.760]   He's trying to get him down as he got Adam down.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   Temptations.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.680]   Look at it as our Lord meets cases of devil possession and sickness and illness and all
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.520]   the ravages of sin and evil.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:25.440]   There he is fighting this battle to release people from sin's foul bondage.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:32.000]   Look at him in the garden of Gethsemane, sweating great drops of blood onto the ground.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   What is this?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   He's in an agony.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   He's struggling.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   What's it mean?
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.360]   Oh, he knows that before he can really deal with his enemy, he's got to pass through that
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.360]   terrible moment when he no longer sees the face of God.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.800]   So he sweats blood.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   It's the conflict against the devil.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:56.760]   And finally on the cross, with the devil attacking the whole time, in the garden and on the cross.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:02.200]   Well there it is, our Lord came, I say, into this world in order to rid us from this tyranny
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.880]   and the power of the devil.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:10.120]   But it was on the cross that he did it supremely and finally.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.560]   This is the thing that I'm holding before you.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.120]   Did you notice those words that I read to you in the twelfth chapter of John's Gospel?
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.080]   "Now is the judgment of this world.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:31.560]   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.560]   And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:43.880]   Notice he said, signifying what death he should die.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:48.280]   You see what's happening in his death is, the judgment of this world, we dealt with
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.680]   that last Sunday night.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:54.600]   Also, now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.720]   He's going to defeat him in his death.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.880]   This I say is this great and wonderful story.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:09.280]   Have you ever been filled with a sense of amazement and wonder at the drama of the cross?
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.520]   Have you ever looked at it like this?
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.720]   We've been surveying this cross and we've seen different things, different aspects coming
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   forth.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   Have you ever looked at it in these terms?
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.560]   The drama, the conflict, the fight.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.700]   How did our Lord ever come to such a place?
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.700]   What got him there?
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:29.240]   "Ah," you say, "that was men who didn't understand him."
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.680]   Is that a sufficient and an adequate answer?
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.480]   My dear friend, can't you see the devil behind men?
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.400]   What was the offense of Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.440]   To whom did he do any harm?
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.500]   What was wrong with his teaching?
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.160]   What was wrong with his miracles?
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.400]   What was wrong with his acts of kindness?
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.780]   He came to do good.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.780]   He came to teach.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.380]   He came to deliver mankind.
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.040]   What reception did he get?
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.500]   Well you know the reception.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.080]   Look at it in the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.080]   Look at their bitterness.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.360]   Look at their hatred.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.900]   Look at their scorn.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.320]   Look at their derision.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.940]   Look at their blasphemy.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:09.760]   Look at it not only there, but look at it in the Roman governor, Pilate in the same
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.200]   way.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.360]   Look at it in the King Herod, the King of the Jews.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.680]   Look at it in the common people.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.360]   Can't you see this terrible blasphemy, this scorn?
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   Why all this feeling?
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.520]   Why all this hatred?
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.440]   Why all this vituperation?
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.040]   There's only one explanation.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.800]   It's the devil that's fighting.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   It's the devil in these men and women.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.200]   My dear friend, let me come right up to date.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.360]   Why do you think it's a clever thing not to be a Christian?
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.320]   What's wrong with Christianity?
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.280]   What's wrong with this blessed person?
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.600]   What's wrong with his teaching?
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   What's your objection?
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.220]   Why do you think it's clever to reject?
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.480]   Why do you blaspheme it?
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.920]   Why do you pour scorn upon it?
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   Why do you hate it?
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.080]   There's only one answer.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.160]   You are the unconscious victim of the devil.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.760]   It's the hatred of the devil that's coming out in you.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.000]   You can't produce reasons for your hatred.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.160]   This is the most extraordinary thing here.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   You see it running right through the records in the four Gospels, as I've already said.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.200]   Listen to this kind of thing.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.480]   When they had planted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and a reed in his right
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:21.800]   hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.040]   And they spit upon him and took a reed and smote him on the head.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.640]   And after they had mocked him, they took the robe from off him and put his own raiment
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.480]   on him and led him away to crucify him.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.480]   Listen.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.760]   And they that passed by when he's actually nailed to the tree reviled him wagging their
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:44.360]   heads and saying, "Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days, save
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.360]   thyself.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.400]   If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross."
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:53.920]   Likewise also said the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders saying, "He
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.520]   has saved others, himself he cannot save.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:01.840]   If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.280]   He trusted in God, let him deliver him now if he will have him.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.520]   For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.800]   The thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same into his teeth."
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.480]   Where are you expert psychologists?
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.720]   How do you explain that?
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.240]   Here's an innocent man, nobody can bring any evidence against him.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.560]   He's done no wrong, indeed he's done nothing but good in the world.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.320]   He came to help people and to teach, I say.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.760]   But look at the spite, look at the mocking and the spitting and the jeering and the scoffing.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.720]   What's the matter with them?
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.720]   There's only one answer to the question, he gave it himself.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:45.600]   He said, "Now is your hour and the power of darkness."
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.360]   These people don't know what they're doing.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.880]   That's why he prayed on the cross and said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.080]   they do and they didn't know what they were doing.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.320]   Would you treat a man like this?
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:04.120]   A man who's done no harm or wrong to anybody at all, who was always going about doing good,
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.560]   would you treat him like this?
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.800]   Wouldn't you make a protest?
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.520]   Would you join the jeering, mocking throng?
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.000]   Would you spit upon him?"
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.360]   I say, "It's unnatural."
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.360]   Of course it is.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:19.240]   It's hellish, it's the devil, it's evil incarnate.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.600]   They know not what they do.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.200]   This is your hour and the power of darkness.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.360]   And this is the wonder of it all.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:33.120]   The world was very pleased with itself, wasn't it, as it looked upon him there dying upon
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.120]   the cross.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.840]   That's why they laugh, you see.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.840]   That's why the joking, "Can't you see it?
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   Can't you see their faces?
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.840]   Have you got enough imagination?
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.840]   Come down!"
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.840]   They say.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:47.480]   "You who say you're the son of God, you who claim to save others, come down, save yourself."
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   He can't save himself.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   Wonderful.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.080]   At last we've got rid of him.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:55.400]   And the chief priests and scribes, of course, they were particularly delighted.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.920]   There was a very clever politician among them, a man called Caiaphas.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.120]   He thought this was very wonderful.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:07.760]   He said, "You know, it's all right," he said, "it's expedient that one man should die for
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.600]   the whole nation at all."
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.520]   Some of the underlings were a little bit unhappy, and Caiaphas, being the high priest, said
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.440]   unto them, "You know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.240]   should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.440]   Let them kill him," he said, "then we'll be right.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.920]   Let's make a scapegoat of him.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.920]   We'll hide behind him.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.720]   Once they've got rid of him, all will be well for us."
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.720]   Everybody was pleased.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   The whole world was delighted.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.720]   At last they'd got him, they'd nailed him, they'd killed him.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.760]   He was finished.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.880]   Was he?
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:49.280]   Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.280]   over them.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.360]   And yet, here they are, they think they've reached the hour of victory.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.920]   They've got this one on their head.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   The devil was delighted.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:01.120]   If only he could kill him, then he'd finished him.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.000]   He would have brought him to death, and that's the end.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.080]   And that was his terrible miscalculation.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:13.560]   He didn't realize, and this is the devil's great blunder, that by bringing the Son of
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:20.200]   God to the cross, he was defeating himself, and bringing about his own ultimate doom.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.200]   How?
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.240]   Well, that's what the apostle says, that our Lord there on the cross, in apparent weakness,
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:30.000]   is putting the devil and his powers to an open shame, and that he's triumphing over
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   them.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   There!
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   How does he do it?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.520]   Well, he does it like this.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.960]   The power of the devil is, after all, nothing but a usurped power.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.240]   He has no power of his own.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.060]   The devil is the God of this world, and the prince of the power of the earth, for one
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:56.120]   reason only, and that is that man in sin has gone out of the kingdom of God, and is therefore
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.660]   in the kingdom of the devil.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:05.980]   The devil has no power over men, except that men is estranged from God, and is no longer
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.180]   in touch with the power of God.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.620]   The only one who can master the devil is God, and the moment we are out of touch with God,
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:16.920]   we are mastered by the devil, and we are his helpless tools and victims in his kingdom
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.300]   like goods in a palace.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.100]   And that is the position of the entire human race.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.180]   The entire human race sinned in Adam, and it became the slave of the devil, as I've
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.180]   shown you.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.660]   We all continue by nature to be the slaves of the devil.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.180]   We are alienated from God, we are under the wrath of God, and we are outside the power
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.180]   of God.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:44.020]   So we are absolutely helpless in the hands of the devil.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:49.460]   The strong man armed keepeth his goods at peace.
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:54.300]   When he rules his palace, his goods are at peace.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.420]   There is only one power that can deliver a man out of the clutches of hell and of the
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.420]   devil.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.180]   It is the power of God.
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.020]   But how can I get that power?
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:08.540]   I've sinned against God, I'm a rebel against God, God's wrath is upon me.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:14.940]   Before I can know the power of God, I must be reconciled to God.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:20.140]   And that was the very thing that was happening on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:24.660]   What stands between every one of us and God is the broken law of God.
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.300]   We've broken God's law, we've insulted him, we've spat upon him, and his condemnation
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.400]   is upon us.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.940]   And we must be delivered from this and reconciled to God before we'll ever know the power that
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:36.940]   can set us free.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.140]   That's exactly what happened on the cross.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.420]   You see, that's why these two verses go together.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.940]   Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:50.460]   us, he took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross, and having spoiled principalities
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.740]   and powers, the two things belong together.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:48:05.220]   There on the cross on Calvary's Hill, our Lord was reconciling us unto God.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:10.580]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:11.580]   them.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:17.860]   Christ had to pay this penalty, the law had to have its way, and he's borne the punishment.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:23.300]   Very well, then anyone who believes in him is out of the punishment, out of the condemnation,
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:29.220]   he's reconciled to God, and the power of God comes in and delivers him from the devil and
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:33.340]   his cohorts and transfers him into the kingdom of God.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.860]   That is why the apostle puts it like this in the first epistle to the Colossians.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:44.180]   He puts it like this, "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.300]   us into the kingdom of his dear Son?"
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.560]   This is how it happens.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.740]   That is what was happening upon the cross.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.220]   The devil thought he was defeating Christ.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.920]   What Christ was doing was this.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:01.740]   He was so reconciling us to God, he defeats the devil and delivers us out of the clutches
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:06.060]   of the devil.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:11.940]   He does it, I say, by paying the penalty and putting us right with God.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:16.340]   When the power of God comes into us and we are born again, we receive new natures, we
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:21.540]   become new people, the Holy Spirit is put within us, and Christ's presence is ever
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.900]   at hand to help us.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.740]   That is why John was able to say, "Look here," he says, "the whole world lieth in the wicked
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:33.380]   one, but that wicked one toucheth us not."
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.100]   He not only touches the world, he embraces the world, and the world can't get out of
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.140]   his clutches.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:43.780]   But Christ takes you out of his clutches, he puts you into his own kingdom, and the
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.340]   devil can't touch you.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.940]   He can frighten you, perhaps, he can shout at you, he can't touch you.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.100]   That is why the apostle Paul says in Romans 6, verse 14, "Sin shall not have dominion
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:59.020]   over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace."
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:06.140]   The one who is stronger than the strong man armed has come, and he has robbed him of his
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.260]   armor wherein he trusted, and he has divided his spile.
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.900]   Oh, what a fool the devil was!
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.820]   How ignorant, how blinded, how puffed up by his own conceit and pride.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:21.660]   He thought he was finishing him, he was really bringing about his own defeat.
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:27.740]   Christ has conquered him, now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.420]   And he was.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.420]   What do I mean?
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:41.980]   I mean this, that before our Lord died upon the cross, the whole world was in the power
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:46.540]   of the devil apart from the Jews, the children of Israel.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.580]   You see, the Greeks come along and they say, "We would see Jesus."
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.580]   He says, "No, not yet.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.380]   I've got to be lifted up before I can bring in you Gentiles."
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:51:00.620]   The devil controlled the nations of the world apart from God's own people until the cross.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:10.260]   He said, "If I be lifted up, I shall draw all men unto me," means men of all nations.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.340]   And he did.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:17.700]   From the moment of the cross, the Gentiles began to believe and to enter into the kingdom
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.700]   of God.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:24.300]   Before they were outside, and they were in the darkness of heathendom and paganism, Christ
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.180]   dies, he becomes the savior of the world.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:36.700]   He draws all men, men of all nations and of kindreds and of climes unto himself.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:42.980]   So you see that what he said himself has literally proved to be the case.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.460]   From the moment he died upon the cross and ascended and sent down the Holy Spirit, the
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.140]   gospel was preached everywhere.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:54.260]   And men and women like these Galatians who were not Jews, they were pagans, they were
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:59.140]   Gentiles, and they were very ignorant and benighted and besotted in sin.
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:05.860]   They had been drawn and claimed and set free from the power of the devil.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.900]   The same had happened to people in Corinth.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:12.820]   You remember how the great apostle reminds them of what they were?
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.540]   He says, "You know, God is not going to be mocked.
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:20.660]   Don't be deceived," he says about this, "neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:26.700]   adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:31.180]   covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.860]   God and such were some of you.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:39.940]   But he are washed, but he are sanctified, but he are justified in the name of the Lord
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:46.260]   Jesus and by the power of our God."
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:53.460]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation,
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.860]   and there is no other power that can save us.
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:00.260]   And that was the power that was released upon the cross.
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:09.420]   And the testimony of the saints of the centuries has been that Christ has set us free.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:19.820]   The prisoner leaps to lose his chains, the weary find eternal rest, and all the sons
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:24.020]   of men are blessed.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:28.620]   Here is one of the most wonderful things about the cross.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.300]   Here is one of the most glorious reasons for glorying in the cross.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.780]   He defeated our ultimate enemy, the devil, the one who originally brought man and the
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.020]   universe down.
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:50.140]   He was cast out, he was defeated, he has been put in chains, and finally he is going to
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:54.460]   be completely and utterly destroyed.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:54:01.820]   He will be cast into the lake with the beast and all the false prophets, and will have
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:05.140]   no more power.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:13.700]   And Jesus shall reign where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run.
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:23.900]   His kingdom stretch from shore to shore, till moon shall wax and wane no more.
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:28.380]   Have you seen the conqueror renowned as you have looked at the cross?
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.820]   Have you seen him tonight?
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:36.820]   If you have, you'll join me in saying these words, "Onward, march, all conquering Jesus,
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.900]   guard thee on thy mighty sword.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:47.740]   Sinful earth can there oppose thee, hell itself quails at thy word.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:59.740]   Thy great name is so exalted, every foe shrinks back in fear, terror creeps through all creation."
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:03.660]   It knows that thou art near.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:12.260]   Do you see him there on the cross, taking these principalities and powers of the devil
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:20.300]   and putting them to an open shame, triumphing over them, by it, ridiculing them, defeating
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:25.020]   them, smashing them?
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:33.640]   At the moment when they were glorifying in their own victory, they were finally and completely
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.700]   defeated and routed.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:55.300]   O Jesus, King most wonderful, thou conqueror, renowned, thou sweetness most ineffable, in
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:56:11.860]   whom all joys are found, God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.860]   Jesus Christ.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.140]   Amen.
