[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   And context is a huge, huge piece of being effective.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.160]   Having all the context in your mind of what's going on,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.040]   of what you're working on, what the company's doing,
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.080]   makes it way easier to operate effectively.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.080]   And if you could, for instance, have two half-time employees
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.400]   or one full-time employee,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.800]   you're way better off with one full-time employee
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.640]   because they're going to have way more context
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.720]   than either of the part-time employees would have
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.640]   and thus be able to work way more efficiently.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.360]   And so in general, I think our experience has actually been
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.040]   that concentrated work is pretty valuable
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.320]   and that if you keep breaking up your work,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.640]   in general, if you do that,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.000]   you're never going to be able to do as great of work
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.040]   as if you really dove into something.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.220]   (upbeat music)
