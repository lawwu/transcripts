[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Today we return to the theme of doomsday prepping, a follow-up from a listener named Matt.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Pastor John, hello. It seems to me that your response in episode 1118 on preparing for a nuclear doomsday
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   was all predicated on the assumption that anybody who prepares for a possible disaster does so out of self-preservation.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   As a father and a husband, I have intentionally put myself in situations that cause extended periods of great personal discomfort
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and danger of injury and death for what I believed was the good of others.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   I say this not to puff myself up, because I certainly have strains of cowardice within me,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   but to make the point that some degree of preparedness for a possible disaster may be from a desire to protect the people I'm charged by God with protecting.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   In fact, in your book, This Momentary Marriage, you say it is a husband's duty to protect his wife physically and spiritually.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I have no great compulsion to preserve my own life, because I can honestly say with Paul, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   But if ever I found myself in a situation where the people I love are suffering, when I could have prevented it,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I would feel like I have failed in my God-given responsibility to protect their physical well-being.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Is this wrong?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Let me restate the question. Have I failed in my responsibility, my God-given responsibility,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   if the people I love are suffering when I could have prevented it?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And the answer is, not necessarily.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It is possible, indeed, that you have been careless in some way and have brought down suffering upon your family for no good reason
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   except your own carelessness or selfishness or foolishness.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yeah, that's possible.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Everybody would agree that thoughtlessness and carelessness and selfishness and foolishness that results in people being hurt is our fault,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and we should feel bad about it and repent and maybe even be punished in jail for such negligence.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But let me ask the question again.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Have I failed in my God-given responsibility if people I love are suffering when I could have prevented it?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   My answer would be no. You have not necessarily failed if you are thoughtfully, prayerfully obeying God's call on your life
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   in the pursuit of a greater good than the physical safety of your family, including their greater good.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   In other words, there is a difference between trying to beat a train to an intersection and taking your family to Pakistan to serve Jesus.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   The first is probably foolishness, and the second may be obedience.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I just typed into Google just before we did this little podcast.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I just typed into Google, "What parts of Minneapolis have the highest crime rate?"
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Well, it's very predictable. I knew what the answers were going to be.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Northwest Minneapolis—North Minneapolis it's usually called—is the most dangerous place to be, and second is Phillips neighborhood.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That's where I live. Have lived here for 37 years.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   37 years ago when I moved in here, I'm pretty sure that if there had been Google, there wasn't any internet, that Phillips would have been number one.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I didn't move here as a hero looking for trouble. I moved here so I could walk to church. I don't like cars.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   If I'd been the pastor of a church in the suburbs, I would have lived in the suburbs, guilt-free.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So don't anybody be, you know, in a shape that I'm telling everybody to live in the city. Hardly.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   If you ask me, "Well, haven't you been concerned about the safety of your kids and your wife? We raised five kids here."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   My answer is, "Yes, but not so concerned as to keep us out."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So if one of the dozens of gunshots that we've heard over the years had come through the window, killed one of my kids, would I feel like I have failed?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   No, I would not.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That kind of thinking is deadly to Christian obedience and the completion of the Great Commission,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   and the living of kingdom lives that show our citizenship is not in this world,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   but they were sojourners here living for the salvation of people and for the good of this world.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   There are many good kingdom reasons for being in this neighborhood besides convenience to get to walk to church.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And I think our location is owing more to obedience than to foolishness.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Now, here's the biblical issue.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Has Jesus failed when he sends his disciples out as sheep in the midst of wolves, and some of them are killed?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Has he failed? Could he have kept them safe?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Well, of course he could, but that's not his top priority, and it's not ours.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Jesus said to those whom he was sending out, "You will be delivered up by parents and brothers and relatives and friends,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and some of you they will put to death.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   You will be hated by all for my name's sake.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Not a hair of your head will perish.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   By your endurance you will gain your lives." Luke 21, 16 to 19.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Among those he was sending out was Peter.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Peter had a wife, and according to Paul in 1 Corinthians 9, 5, Peter took his wife with him on his travels like sheep in the midst of wolves.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Or what about Paul?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   When he was in Corinth and the Jews stirred up a case against him, and Galileo, the Roman proconsul, said,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   "That's not my business. Get out of here. I don't want to mess with you Christians."
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And so the Jews couldn't silence Paul, so what did they do?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   They beat up Sosthenes, the poor guy.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He's a brand-new convert, a ruler of the synagogue.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Paul refers to him later on in his letters, Acts 18, 15 and 17.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   They beat him up.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Was Paul a failure for converting Sosthenes and putting him in the way of danger?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Paul didn't think so, because Luke tells us that after converting many people to Christ,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Paul went back to the churches to make sure they understood that to be a Christian means suffering.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Acts 14, 22, he was strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and saying through many tribulations, "We must enter the kingdom of God."
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   He didn't want them to be naive Christians.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   He had won them over to danger.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   In other words, Paul was taking full responsibility of calling people into a life that would have more trouble,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   more danger than if they had not converted to Jesus.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   So let's ask the question one last time.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Have I failed in my God-given responsibility if people I love are suffering when I could have prevented it?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And the answer is, maybe so, maybe not.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I wrote an article at Desiring God a few weeks back called "Risk Your Kids for the Kingdom?"
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And I would encourage folks to go there and look at it to see what kind of argument I developed from the Bible.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I argued there that when Paul was talking in 1 Timothy 5, 8, and saying,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   "Anyone who does not provide for his household has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever,"
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   he was talking about world-idolizing slackers, not self-denying emissaries of Christ.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   The same distinction needs to be made right here in answering this question.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   If your family suffers because you are a selfish slacker, you're worse than an unbeliever.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   But if they suffer in spite of your readiness to live and die for them
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   because God has sent you all to a risky place for his kingdom purposes,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   your heart may be broken, but you should not say, "I have failed."
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   For every man who fails his family in the path of obedience to God's call,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I would guess there are probably a thousand men who fail their family by keeping them safe in the path of prosperity.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I'm not claiming to know how much risk you should take with yourself and your family for Christ.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I'm just saying, if Jesus and Paul had made the safety of their converts a criterion of success, they would be failures.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Christianity cannot advance in a fallen world without risk to everybody.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Sobering thoughts for leaders of families. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question.
